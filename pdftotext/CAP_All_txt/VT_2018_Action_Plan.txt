July 31, 2018
Dear Governor Phil Scott,

With deep dedication to the future of the State of Vermont, the Vermont Climate Action
Commission presents you with our final report, which is a compilation of our findings and
recommendations intended to meet the important charge you put forward to us last July.
Vermont can seize the opportunity to lead the economic innovation that climate change requires
over the coming decades. Despite the federal government’s retreat on climate leadership, we agree
that we can use our fundamental strengths and competitive advantages to tackle this urgent issue,
bringing sustainable prosperity to our small but strong state.
We concur with your assessment in the 2018 State of the State address: “We can still control our
own destiny.” Vermont can be a leader in addressing climate change with economic solutions that
support community health and prosperity for the future.
We appreciate your leadership commitment to climate action, and we hope the recommendations
in this report can be implemented to move Vermont forward. Your executive order charged the
Commission to “develop a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate
change that addresses these fundamental principles:
•
•
•

solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions must spur economic activity, inspire and
grow Vermont businesses, and put Vermonters on a path to affordability;
the development of solutions must engage all Vermonters, so no individual or group of
Vermonters is unduly burdened; and
programs developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must collectively provide
solutions for all Vermonters to reduce their carbon impact and save money.”

The Commission report outlines our shared understanding of where we are today and what is
needed for Vermont to do its part to meet the Paris Climate Agreement, the Comprehensive Energy
Plan targets, and Vermont’s statutory greenhouse gas emission reduction goals. These
recommendations are intended to both mitigate Vermont’s contribution to climate change and seize
the economic opportunity in a smart, strategic and equitable response. By taking action now,
Vermont can build economic growth and be well-positioned to be economically competitive in the
future.
Despite the recent news that Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions rose 10 percent in two years –
2014 and 2015 – we are confident these recommendations can serve as a platform to advance the
transformation of our energy system to one that is efficient, clean, resilient, affordable and
accessible to all Vermonters – in particular the most vulnerable. Vermont’s climate economy is a
job-creating engine, and our recommendations support further action and leadership to grow this
sector. We make these recommendations with the knowledge that it is not a complete set of
actions Vermont must take to meet this challenge, but we believe our prioritized focus on areas of
need and areas of opportunity will be fundamental to meeting our commitments.



Vermonters have dedicated themselves to environmental improvements for many years, and there
is an important role for continued citizen engagement in the State’s climate efforts. We would
advise the creation of a citizen advisory body to support the implementation of supported
recommendations. We provide additional detail on this proposal in the report.
Thank you again for supporting a strong and prosperous future for Vermont.

Introduction

The Context: Challenge and Opportunity
Global climate change is a fundamental threat to Vermont, to our economy, environment, and way
of life. Despite these threats, as Governor Scott noted in his 2018 State of the State Address, “our
fate is not predetermined.”
Due to the breadth of transformation required, we must all take part in the solutions and receive the
benefits of mitigating and reversing global climate change. The most powerful lever to do this is
economic: transforming our economy away from carbon-based energy sources, improving
efficiencies, advancing recycling, composting and carbon sequestration, and transforming
transportation and heating away from carbon fuels.
Creative Vermont businesses, ranging from utilities to solar and battery storage developers, to
contractors, manufacturers, agricultural businesses, and inventors working on electric flight, are
already contributing to progress. In the global competition to contend with climate change, places
that lead will benefit by capturing the attention of entrepreneurs, investors and youth. Being a
place that dedicates itself to building economic answers to climate challenges will also respond to
some of the economic challenges that Vermont faces and be a path to economic renewal
throughout the state.
The Charge to the Vermont Climate Action Commission
In July 2017, Governor Phil Scott convened the Vermont Climate Action Commission. The
Governor set the essential framework to focus the Commission’s work. “WHEREAS, through the
2016 Comprehensive Energy Plan, Vermont has committed to reducing greenhouse gas
emissions by at least forty percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and eighty to ninety five percent
below 1990 levels by 2050, and meeting ninety percent of energy needs from renewable sources
by 2050.”
Governor Scott tasked the Commission to “develop a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions and combat climate change that addresses these fundamental principles:
•
•
•

solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions must spur economic activity, inspire and
grow Vermont businesses, and put Vermonters on a path to affordability;
the development of solutions must engage all Vermonters, so no individual or group of
Vermonters is unduly burdened; and
programs developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must collectively provide
solutions for all Vermonters to reduce their carbon impact and save money.”

As the 21 members of the Commission, we offer Governor Phil Scott and the citizens of the State
of Vermont this report, which highlights our findings and outlines recommendations intended to
meet the charge put forward by the Governor. In December 2017, at the Governor’s request, the
Commission submitted a list of preliminary recommendations. Those recommendations and the
Governor’s response can be found at the Commission’s website:

Where We Are Today
Our work has been focused upon meeting the State’s climate goals, as contained in its statutory
greenhouse gas reduction goals, as well as Vermont’s 90 by 2050 renewable total energy goal,
along with our commitment with other states to follow through in meeting the Paris Climate
Agreement. Those goals are:
•
•
•

Statutory greenhouse gas reduction goals – a 50 percent reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions by January 1, 2028 and a 75 percent reduction by January 1, 2050.
Comprehensive Energy Plan goals – 25 percent by 2025, 40 percent by 2035 and 90
percent of all energy needs through renewable supplies by 2050, while reducing energy
consumption per capita by more than one third by 2050.
U.S. Climate Alliance – a 26-28 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions below
2005 levels by 2025.

If Vermont continues its current trajectory – with rising, not declining greenhouse gas emissions
– we will not meet these goals. Moreover, we risk missing the economic opportunities that will
enable Vermont to thrive in the years ahead. Figure 1 below shows where we stand today and
where we need to go to meet our statutory greenhouse gas reduction goals, the Comprehensive
Energy Plan greenhouse gas reduction goals, and the Paris Climate Agreement goals. Shifting
this trajectory will take concerted effort and investment which will also result in more affordable
homes, businesses, and transportation, a stronger economy, and a cleaner environment.
Figure 1: Vermont Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mid-Term Goals1

Vermont’s Opportunity: A Smart, Strong, and Strategic Climate Response
Vermont is already feeling the effects of a changing climate, primarily through more intense and
frequent storms that have led to devastating and costly floods as well as a dramatic increase in tickborne diseases, invasive species, and other changes. The devastating impacts of Tropical Storm
Irene in 2011 are the clearest example of what Vermont will face if we, along with the rest of the
nation and globe, do not act now.

Department of Environmental Conservation’s Air Quality and Climate Division website: http://dec.vermont.gov/airquality/climate-change

The changes needed now will drive down our emissions and extract carbon from the atmosphere,
but we will still be faced with significant climate impacts. The Commission developed
recommendations explicitly to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, but we strongly
believe that we must act now to adapt to anticipated conditions moving forward. Some of our
recommendations, which focus largely on greenhouse gas emissions reduction strategies, have the
side benefit of actively reinforcing efforts to adapt to our new climate and improve Vermont’s
resiliency.
Vermont is already making significant progress toward a renewable electricity sector, due to a
combination of public policy and market activity, but, as Figure 2 shows, electric power production
only accounts for 10 percent of Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions. The increasing percentage
of renewable energy does create opportunities for reducing emissions in the building and
transportation sectors by helping Vermonters utilize increasingly clean, low carbon electric heating
and transportation technologies.
Figure 3: Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sector through 20152

Vermont’s energy burden – the proportion of income individuals spend on fuel for their cars,
homes, and businesses – is high. By making it easier to use non-motorized and alternatively-fueled
transportation, Vermonters will pay less to move around without losing the convenience and
freedom enabled by our current transportation model. By weatherizing our existing building stock,
and increasingly using locally-sourced, sustainably harvested biomass and high efficiency electric
heat, Vermonters will be able to more affordably keep their homes comfortable in the winter.
These major changes to our two primary greenhouse gas emission sectors – transportation and
buildings – are beginning already, but they need to be brought rapidly to scale to achieve the
financial and greenhouse gas savings envisioned.

Further, Vermont has the opportunity to be a leader in the climate economy and get ahead of the
massive economic disruption that is beginning to take place. If we seize this opportunity, Vermont
will be well positioned to flourish. According to the World Bank, the Paris Agreement will help
open up nearly $23 trillion in new opportunities for climate-smart investments around the world,
between now and 2030. The International Energy Agency anticipates investments of $13.5
trillion in clean energy investments alone over the coming 15 years.
In Vermont and around the world, the private sector is already responding. More than 700
companies with combined market capitalization greater than $16 trillion have made more than
1200 commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes pledges to adopt sciencebased emissions reduction targets, to remove commodity-driven deforestation from supply
chains, and to set carbon prices. Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch parent of Ben & Jerry’s, has made
pledges across nine different commitment areas, including a promise to reach net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
Forward-looking companies are harnessing the benefits of transitioning to 100 percent renewable
power, including cost reduction, increased innovation, and reputational gains. These companies
choose supply chains and locations based on the availability of renewable energy and the
strength of policies that support a transition to a low-carbon economy. Many of the world’s
leading technology companies are reconciling the growth in consumer demand with their climate
commitments by relocating energy-intensive data centers to locations that offer renewable
energy options. The government of Quebec is pioneering provincial leadership to respond to
corporate demand with an aggressive marketing campaign, promoting Quebec as a low-carbon
home and attempting to lure companies with the promise of hydropower. Ireland’s Industrial
Development Authority is considering a similar approach.
Reaching our goals will mean a thriving Vermont economy, more affordable and healthier lives for
Vermonters, and a significant competitive advantage over those states and nations that fail to grasp
this opportunity. Developing the technology to integrate distributed, renewable energy and storage
resources into the electric grid, improving the efficiency and energy use of our homes and
business, and advancing additional climate economy opportunities will continue to be a major
factor in Vermont’s economic growth. Encouraging that sector to grow in Vermont will lead to
good jobs – tech jobs, manufacturing jobs, and skilled technician jobs.
Getting There Will Take Time – But We Won’t Get There if We Don’t Act Now
Transforming our state will take a generation or more. To get there we must increase momentum
and take meaningful steps forward immediately. There is no silver bullet – no single policy or
pathway – that will ensure this necessary transition occurs, so we must begin taking action on
multiple fronts to reach our goals.
The Energy Action Network (EAN) has completed a recent review of the available data to arrive at
what they believe to be the top 10 drivers for reducing Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions
(Figure 3 below). This analysis was done based on the 2013 greenhouse gas emissions inventory,
so additional action will be necessary to meet the targets given the significant increase in emissions
in 2014 and 2015. While the Commission does not explicitly endorse EAN’s selected pathway as
correct or most likely, the analysis is useful to understand the magnitude of changes necessary to
meet Vermont’s goals. In its report, the Commission highlights areas where additional data is
needed to create drivers in other areas.

Figure 3: Energy Action Network’s Top 10 Drivers3

Many sectors of the economy are responding quickly to climate change. In others, the
opportunities are just beginning to emerge. We must take intentional actions to encourage slowmoving economic sectors to flourish and drive the change for the long-term. The
recommendations below reflect Commission-prioritized actions, not a complete list of actions,
necessary to achieve Vermont’s climate goals.
The Commission made the decision to prioritize opportunities where Vermont could have a
significant impact, create momentum across the economy, and capture our competitive advantage.
More information on the process the Commission undertook to arrive at this prioritization scheme
can be found in Appendix B.
The recommendations prioritize five areas. The first three are based on needed greenhouse gas
emissions reductions: transportation, building energy, and land use. The fourth set of
recommendations identifies ways to harness Vermont’s natural and working lands to store carbon.
The fifth focus of recommendations is Vermont’s growing climate economy and the potential to
capture Vermont’s competitive advantage. These five sets of recommendations represent areas of
focus but not the complete suite of actions and policies necessary to meet Vermont’s GHG
reduction and climate change goals.
In early July 2018 – shortly before the finalization of this report – the Vermont Agency of
Natural Resources published its latest greenhouse gas inventory. This analysis provided an

update to the most recent 2013 report upon which the work of this Commission has been based.
Since the last analysis (current as of 2015), Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions rose to 16
percent above the 1990 baseline year; a rise in Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions of 10
percent in just two years.
While emissions rose in each energy sector, the 2015 inventory highlights the fundamental
imperative that Vermont more aggressively address emissions from the unregulated fuels
sectors in particular – transportation and residential, commercial, and industrial fuel. We
will not meet this challenge otherwise despite a strong focus on transforming our energy sector –
primarily our electric supply.
Based on this new information, the Commission urges that, unless there is significant progress in
greenhouse gas emission reductions, Vermont should institute additional, wide scale measures to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions, informed by the Joint Fiscal Office’s analysis of
decarbonization methods in Vermont and other emergent information. Such measures can be
used to advance economic activity to answer the climate challenge.
We would also be remiss to leave out a discussion of future generations. Climate change will
have long-term effects and thus must be addressed by generations to come. Without ongoing
support for and from future generations, these recommendations will fail to create lasting
change. We encourage Vermont to make environmental science an educational pillar for our
young students and future leaders and to bring college students and other young adults into
Vermont’s green economy workforce.
Investment and Return
The actions we recommend will reap long-term savings for Vermonters. To maximize those
savings, upfront investments will be required. Many Vermonters may not have the information or
financial means to make the necessary changes. In many cases, our recommendations include
opportunities to increase all Vermonters’ ability to access long-term savings.
We believe there is a leadership role for the State of Vermont to play in making these investments,
but we do not believe that government needs to be the lead in all instances. The State should
certainly ensure supportive policies are in place and that there is a level playing field for all
Vermonters. Without forward looking and ambitious leadership, Vermont risks falling far short of
our goals and having the benefits of the clean energy future enjoyed by only economically
advantaged Vermonters.
We include four indicators with each recommendation: the relative greenhouse gas impact, the
potential savings, the scale of investment needed, and the ease to implement. The scale of
investment indicator provides an order of magnitude estimate for what’s needed to tip the scales to
produce the desired outcome. We anticipate economic benefits and pollution reduction in all of
our recommendations or the actions that will follow in the case of recommendations that create
necessary conditions for additional action.
With smart investments in climate action, Vermont can advance economic innovation, opportunity,
and job creation; become more affordable for all; and protect the most vulnerable of its citizens.

Ongoing Climate Leadership
The Commission has worked diligently to respond to the charge provided in Executive Order 1217. This report represents the culmination of that charge, and yet we believe there should be a
continued role for organized citizen support in the implementation of these recommendations and
other actions taken by State agencies. We, therefore, detail a recommendation in Chapter IV to
create a structure and process that facilitates that ongoing citizen engagement.
Report Organization
This report is organized into four chapters: this introduction, the suite of recommendations
divided into five categories, and finally a discussion of continued citizen engagement in
developing and implementing state climate policy, and a conclusion that furthers the discussion
on leadership and investment.
The report is supported by five appendices: the first containing Executive Order 12-17; the
second outlining our membership, charge, and process; a third containing additional information
for the recommendations, a fourth containing a list of acronyms used; and a fifth containing the
voting record of the Commission.

II.

A Vision for Vermont

In drafting the report, the Commission organized its recommendations around the ways it will
impact Vermont and the lives of Vermonters. The recommendations are presented in tables
relevant to each of five topics: homes and workplaces, getting around, communities and
landscapes, carbon sequestration, and the climate economy.
For each recommendation, the Commission endeavored to estimate the likely greenhouse gas
impact if the recommendation was fully implemented. In many instances, the ability to estimate
the impact of individual recommendations is challenging as many recommendations combine for
a greater impact to the overall sector of the economy. In those instances, we present individual
recommendation impacts but also present the impacts of the group of recommendations as a
whole – which provides an estimate with improved confidence in its accuracy. For example, the
Commission has put forward several recommendations about the electrification of the light duty
vehicle fleet. The overall impact of those recommendations (if implemented) can be calculated
with confidence, but separating out the contribution of each individual recommendation produces
a less precise result.
For reference, Vermont’s annual GHG emissions were 8.59 million metric tons of CO2
equivalent (MMTCO2e) as of 1990, 10.22 MMTCO2e as of 2005, and 9.99 MMTCO2e as of
2015. Therefore, to reach the CEP commitment of a 40 percent reduction below 1990 levels,
Vermont would need to reduce its annual GHG emissions 4.84 MMTCO2e below 2015 levels by
2030. To reach the Paris commitment of a 26-28 percent reduction below 2005 levels, Vermont
would need to reduce its annual GHG emissions 2.42 MMTCO2e below 2015 levels by 2025.
In light of these commitments and the scale of GHG emissions reductions they require, this
report assigns a GHG impact rating (0-4) for the possible scale of greenhouse gas reduction that
could reasonably be expected from various recommendations:
•

•

•

•

High impact (4) recommendations are those that, by 2025, can reasonably be expected to
get Vermont more than 10 percent of the way towards our 2030 CEP commitment (i.e.
more than a 484 MTCO2e (thousand tons of CO2 equivalent) annual reduction), or more
than 20 percent of the way towards our 2025 Paris commitment;
Moderate impact (3) recommendations are those that, by 2025, can reasonably be
expected to get Vermont between 5 percent and 10 percent of the way towards our 2030
CEP commitment (between a 242 and 484 annual MTCO2e reduction), or between 10-20
percent of the way towards our 2025 Paris commitment;
Low impact (2) recommendations are those that, by 2025, can reasonably be expected to
get Vermont between 2.5 percent and 5 percent of the way towards our 2030 CEP
commitment (between a 121 and 242 MTCO2e annual reduction), or approximately
between 5 -10 percent of the way towards our 2025 Paris commitment; and
Lowest impact (1) recommendations are those that, by 2025, can only reasonably be
expected to get Vermont less than 2.5 percent of the way towards our 2030 CEP
commitment (less than a 121 MTCO2e annual reduction), or less than 5 percent towards
our 2025 Paris commitment.

Additionally, for each recommendation, the Commission estimated the potential savings impact
for Vermonters as well as the scale of investment needed to implement these recommendations.
-8-



As with the GHG impact estimates, these reflect the best professional judgment of the
Commission, but it is critical that as these recommendations move forward that additional
analysis be conducted to refine and improve these estimates.
In several instances, making an accurate prediction of impact is not feasible. Some
recommendations serve as precursor or foundational actions to unlock potential GHG emission
reductions and/or cost savings. In those instances, the tables include an icon that conveys the
unlocking of that potential ( ). In several instances, the impact cannot be measured, has not
been measured yet, or is primarily to prevent further emissions or the loss of sequestered carbon.
Those are indicated in the tables by a “U,” an “NYM,” or a “P” representation, respectively.
The below key, which is included at the beginning of each of the five sections, provides the
breakdown for what each estimate and associated iconography should convey to the reader.

recommendation or explain the assumptions made to arrive at the estimates made, that
information is included by recommendation in Appendix C.
Appendix D provides a list of common acronyms used.

Disclaimer: Below, in each section, we have identified several stakeholders who will either likely
lead the effort or be a pivotal partner in it. There are likely several other pivotal players that
have not been noted, however, and the list is by no means comprehensive. To undertake this
work, it will take many different partners and the support of Vermonters more broadly.
-9-



A. Homes and Workplaces
Thermal energy use, or heat, in buildings accounts for approximately 30 percent of Vermont’s
total energy consumption and approximately 24 percent of Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions,
largely from burning fossil fuels: fuel oil, kerosene, natural gas, and propane. The residential
sector accounts for 60 percent of Vermont’s thermal fuel consumption, commercial 29 percent
and industrial 11 percent.
Approximately 68 million gallons of heating oil and 67 million gallons of propane are sold
annually in Vermont for residential consumption. Approximately 67 million gallons of propane
are sold annually for residential consumption. Wood is widely used for residential heating; an
estimated 37 percent of Vermont households use wood as a heat source, and wood heat accounts
for 21 percent of all Vermont heating.4
Commercial enterprises primarily use heating oil and propane for space heating, but also for air
conditioning, refrigeration, cooking, and a wide variety of other purposes. These uses consume
24 million gallons of heating oil and 43 million gallons of propane each year.
Industrial enterprises typically use heating oil and propane for manufacturing, with few instances
of its use for space heating. These industrial uses in Vermont annually use 21 million gallons of
heating oil and 4 million gallons of propane.
In 2013, Vermonters paid over $500 million to import and burn fossil-based heating fuels. Most
of this money left the Vermont economy.
Investing in thermal efficiency improvements, primarily air sealing, insulation and heating
system replacements, can dramatically reduce a building’s thermal fuel requirements while
increasing its affordability.
Thermal energy use is the second largest contributor to Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions:
about 24 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Curbing emissions will require significantly
reducing fuel use in existing buildings.
The 2016 Comprehensive Energy Plan calls for reduction in total energy consumption by 2050
by one third and by 2025 obtaining 30 percent of the heat used in buildings and 25 percent in
industry from renewable sources.
Vision for Vermont’s Buildings:
Four paths will transform our building sector to reduce greenhouse gas emissions:
•
•
•
•

Strategic and significant electrification for heating and cooling;
Increased advanced wood heating;
Investment in deep retrofit and weatherization of existing buildings; and
Limited growth in emissions from new construction.

Together, these strategies are intended to meet the following objectives:
•
•
•
•
•

Foster low-cost, local sources of heating;
Ensure that Vermonters of all incomes maintain affordable heating and energy services;
Use clean, renewable, and local electricity generation for space and water heating;
Foster the development of new business opportunities in biomass; and
Reduce building energy burden for Vermonters.

Achieving the Vision for Vermont’s Buildings:
In order to achieve the vision outlined above, the Commission has developed the following
overarching themes for its recommendations. The specific recommendations follow.
Building Electrification and Advanced Wood Heating:
•
•
•

Expand incentives for electrification and advanced wood heating;
Adopt rate design to lower the costs of building electrification; and
Increase awareness of advanced wood heating and electrification and benefits to all
Vermont.

Building Weatherization and Demand Management
•
•
•

Foster designs for low-energy consumption and demand management;
Reduce the energy costs of existing and new buildings; and
Integrate advanced controls and rate design to encourage sound energy management by
consumers, utilities, and third-party providers.

Homes and Workplaces Recommendations:
The recommendations contained below should be considered as similar and all seeking the same
end. Therefore, the Commission has determined that grouping the GHG impact of the
recommendations makes sense to convey the scale of change possible. However, each individual
action has a measurable contribution as well, so those impacts are reported individually in the
tables that follow. The potential impact of implementing the below recommendations is high. If
Vermont realizes the GHG emissions saving expected from these recommendations, we would
achieve more than 10 percent of the overall emissions reductions necessary to achieve Vermont’s
GHG emissions reduction targets.

Background:
Current resources to meet Vermont’s low-income weatherization goals are inadequate. For many lowincome residents, this means colder homes, burdensome heating costs, discomfort, and poor health. In
2007, Vermont set a goal of weatherizing 20,000 low income homes by 2020. As of March 2016, there
was still a gap of 9,200 homes. Vermont spends approximately $9.5 million annually to weatherize
about 900 homes through the Weatherization Assistance Program; that is $11,000 per home, producing
approximately 25 percent in home energy savings and lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 1.8 tons
per home annually. This recommendation proposes to weatherize an additional 900-3,600 low-income
homes. This could be accomplished through an aggressive short-term surge over the next four years
with an additional 3,600 homes weatherized via a $39M bond. It could also be accomplished through
an increase in funding for the Vermont Weatherization Assistance Program run by the Department of
Children and Family’s Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) by $9.5M to double the number of
homes completed in 2017 over the next four years (an additional 900 homes annually).

Background:
Wood plays a major role in Vermont's energy mix. An estimated 37 percent of Vermont households
heat at least in part with firewood or wood pellets. More than 100 larger buildings use wood chips or
pellets for heating, and this number is rapidly growing. Vermont is a leader in heating schools and
institutional facilities with wood chips; more than one third of all Vermont children attend a school
heated by wood. To reach Vermont’s GHG goals and to improve air quality, the transition to AWH is
essential.

DUs and PSD

Background:
Building electrification refers to the pathways to help shift largely fossil fuel consumption toward
increasingly clean, and ideally less expensive forms of heating enabled through electricity. Promising
technologies here include cold climate heat pumps and heat pump water heaters. Heat pumps are three
to four times more effective at heating a space than traditional electric resistance heat. The same
technology that is used to heat a space can also be used to cool a space. Because the categories of enduses for which the technology is employed represent flexible loads, these loads can be managed or
controlled for additional grid value or benefit. Storage systems, including battery technology, represent
complementary enablers of electrification that also serve to enable grid integration of distributed
renewable energy technologies.

Background:
A typical Vermont residence heating with No. 2 heating oil has a heating load requirement of 80 to 100
MMBtu. The average commercial structure ranges from 120 to 150 MMBtu. Approximately 1,000
new homes and 200 commercial buildings are built each year. Net-zero buildings have zero net energy
consumption. Energy requirements are met through more efficient systems or integrated renewable
energy systems. The most cost-effective way to implement energy efficiency is by ensuring that the
technologies are embedded in its construction or manufacturing. Net-zero design ensures that
buildings reach the highest levels of energy efficiency and incorporate the enabling technologies for
building management and renewable energy generation. Part of the path to affordable housing is to
ensure that all cost-effective technologies are integrated into the new building and housing stock to
help ensure that the challenges do not continue to grow.

constructed

PSD (EEUs)

3. For existing commercial buildings require benchmarking and a
label utilizing Energy Star Portfolio Manager for the largest buildings
(50K+ square feet)

Legislature (EEUs)

Background:
Energy ratings and labeling would provide information on a building’s energy use. A building rating
takes the building energy usage information and provides a comparison with similar buildings. The
energy data and rating can be used to develop a building energy label, which can present a simple
visual of the information, much like a fuel economy sticker on a new car. This information can be
useful to potential buyers as a means of comparing energy efficiency levels of various buildings and to
assess what their future energy costs might be for those buildings. This information may also
encourage investment in efficiency on the part of either a prospective buyer or a property seller. For
home buyers, this also presents a potential opportunity to include any needed efficiency improvements
in an energy efficient mortgage.

PSD (OEO, EEUs)

2. Expand the Heat Saver Loan and NeighborWorks of Western
Vermont loan program by $5 million

Efficiency Vermont/
Treasurer

Background:
Current resources to meet Vermont’s low-to-moderate income weatherization goals are inadequate. For
many low-income residents, this means colder homes, burdensome heating costs, discomfort, and poor
health. Since 2008, the Energy Efficiency Utilities (Efficiency Vermont, Burlington Electric
Department, and Vermont Gas Systems) have weatherized over 10,000 homes through their efficiency
programs, however there is only a modest emphasis on serving low and moderate-income households.
An increase in low and moderate income weatherization investments made today will reduce fuel needs
for the most vulnerable Vermonters, lower their energy costs, make their homes healthier, and reduce
carbon emissions, thereby providing significant economic returns on investments.

2. Establish a pilot with Vermont State Colleges (VSC)

BGS (financial institutions,

Background:
Expand the State Energy Management Program (“SEMP”) to provide energy management services to
Vermont’s institutional market. The program will build on the success of the Department of Buildings
and General Services’ SEMP model. The SEMP is now augmented, in accordance with ACT 58 of
2016 Sec. E.112, through a partnership between Efficiency Vermont and BGS to achieve a specific
amount of annual savings. The innovative model employed to achieve these savings can be adapted to
obtain new energy savings and greenhouse gas reductions in other parts of the broader institutional
market in the state. The institutional market includes municipalities, universities, schools and hospitals
(i.e., the MUSH sector). Many organizations within this market struggle with high energy costs which
in turn are passed on to taxpayers, students, and patients. While there have been previous
achievements of energy savings in this sector, barriers still exist that often hinder success in many
regions.

B. Getting Around
Transportation is the largest contributor to Vermont’s greenhouse gas emissions of all sectors
(43.3 percent). Electrification of the transportation sector, whether personal vehicles or transit
and school buses, will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the percentage of
renewably powered transportation options, and keep more of the dollars spent on transportation
fuels within the state. Vermont state policy has focused on expanding the use of renewable
sources in electric generation and currently has one of the cleanest grids in the country. Powering
the transportation sector with clean, renewable energy, increases the benefits from electrification.
Recent studies on climate and energy in Vermont have identified plug-in electric vehicles (EVs)
as a key pathway to meeting long-term goals, given how many Vermonters still travel long
distances to get to jobs and services. Meeting the Vermont 2016 Comprehensive Energy Plan
(CEP) illustrative goal of 10 percent renewably powered transportation would require about
45,000 EVs in Vermont by 2025 – a major increase from the current 2,500 – and more recent
analysis indicates we need closer to 60,000 EVs to meet the emissions reduction goals of the
Paris Accord.
Regardless of the target, EVs powered by renewable energy will provide major reductions in
Vermonters’ greenhouse gas emissions while also lowering annual household transportation
expenses. However, existing market forces will not increase the market share of EVs fast enough
to meet Vermont’s climate and energy targets for the transportation sector. Three principal
barriers to accelerated adoption are:
• a lack of sufficient charging station infrastructure.
• a lack of general awareness about the benefits of switching to EVs and how to do it
affordably.
• the upfront costs of EVs (including used EVs), especially for low and middle-income
Vermonters and rural Vermonters (who depend the most on personal vehicles to get to
work and school and for other essential travel).
A fourth concern that is related to electric charging costs. In the December 2017
recommendations of the Vermont Climate Action Commission, we recommended the creation of
a Public Utility Commission (PUC) process to evaluate how to create less expensive and more
transparent EV charging. Increasingly, technology is enabling electric pricing that can
encourage effective management of customer loads and help the uptake of EVs as consumers
evaluate lifecycle costs, but knowledge and use barriers still exist. The Commission fully
supports the work of the PUC to evaluate and develop solutions for these challenges.
Vermont’s transit buses and school buses show how our rural state has worked to provide transit
and other transportation choices that help people get where they need to go. At the same time,
the inefficient diesel buses that make up most fleets create negative impacts on public health and
the environment: they emit diesel exhaust that is dangerous to children, drivers, and passersby,
especially those with chronic disease; they are subject to fluctuations in fuel prices; and they are
inefficient – the average diesel transit bus gets just 4.5 miles per gallon.

- 20 -



Vermont’s apportionment of a federal settlement with Volkswagen (VW) is intended to mitigate
the impact of VW’s cheat devices on Vermont’s nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, primarily from
inefficient diesel engines. The heavy-duty-vehicle portion of these funds could provide a oncein-a-generation opportunity to reduce NOx emissions and leverage longer-term market
transformation in the heavy-duty sector that would result in significant NOx and greenhouse gas
emissions reductions. Dedicating VW settlement funds to heavy-vehicle electrification, along
with important grid management solutions, would lead to an increased use of renewable energy
in the transportation sector and health benefits that far exceed other proposed options, such as
moving to newer, more efficient diesel vehicles, over the long run.
While vehicle electrification is essential for reducing transportation energy use and greenhouse
gas emissions from the transportation sector, transportation demand management (TDM) is also
necessary. As the 2016 CEP points out, “Transportation energy use is fundamentally driven by
the locations of homes and businesses, along with the public, private, and commercial
infrastructure that includes our roads, sidewalks, transit systems, and vehicles.” Broader issues
relating to land-use planning are addressed in the “Communities and Landscapes” section of this
report; this section on “Getting Around” includes recommendations to advance the 2016 CEP’s
strategy of shifting transportation away from single occupancy vehicles to more energy efficient
options, like public transit, walking, biking, and car sharing. Together, vehicle electrification
and TDM can move Vermont toward its transportation-sector energy goals while benefitting
public health, the economy, and Vermont’s traditional culture and character.
Vision for Vermont’s Transportation System
Two paths will transform our greenhouse gas intensive transportation sector and maximize
mobility options for all. Specific recommendations focus on:
•
•

Strategic and significant vehicle electrification, maximizing the use of the VW settlement
and other funds.
Expanding multi-modal transportation choices and transportation efficiency.

Together, these strategies are intended to meet the following objectives:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Create an environment in which it is convenient, safe and affordable to travel by electric
vehicles, bus, rail, bike, or foot and to share rides.
Make it more convenient and economical for Vermonters of all incomes to purchase and
travel by electric vehicles.
Reduce vehicle miles traveled and single occupancy vehicle trips by Vermonters.
Increase accessibility to jobs, services, and community activities.
Reduce transportation energy burden for Vermonters.
Reduce transportation-related impacts on communities and Vermont’s natural resources.

Achieving the Vision for Vermont’s Transportation System: The Rationale for the Recommended
Actions
To achieve the vision outlined above, the Commission has developed the following overarching
themes for its recommendations. The specific recommendations follow.

Getting Around Recommendations:
The recommendations in the “Getting Around” category can be best represented in three groups:
light duty vehicle electrification, heavy duty vehicle electrification, and transportation mode
shifting. Accurately predicting the impact of the cumulative impact of these groups of
recommendations is more appropriate given that all of the individual recommendations factor in
to the success of the overall effort.
The overall impacts of the three groups are reflected below. For each individual
recommendation in this section, the table for that recommendation will reference the overall
cumulative impact of the group of recommendations.

Background:
High purchase prices are one of the main barriers to widespread EV adoption in Vermont. Point of sale
incentives are a proven mechanism to overcome this barrier, based on experience in Vermont and other
states. Vermont has secured an additional $6.5 million in a new state consumer protection settlement
with Volkswagen and its subsidiaries; $2.9 million of those dollars are destined to go back to VW
customers. The VCAC unanimously recommended in a letter to Governor Scott and legislative leaders
dated June 18, 2018 that the remaining $3.6 million be used to build an electric vehicle point-of-sale
customer incentive for new and used cars. This recommendation focuses on the next steps needed use
these funds for an incentive program and to identify program designs that will target incentives to
Vermonters who need it the most.

DEV

Background:
Research shows that Vermonters tend to purchase used rather than new vehicles. As more EVs are
coming off lease, there is the potential to grow a used EV market in Vermont. However, there are
barriers to keeping used vehicles in state, primarily due to the cost to dealers to purchase and resell
used EVs. We recommend working with auto dealers and other stakeholders to better understand
barriers to keeping used EVs in Vermont and identify strategies to address these barriers. In addition,
educational resources can be made available to consumers through Drive Electric Vermont (DEV).

Background:
ACCD is administering Vermont’s VW allocation for EV charging. This is a rare opportunity to
rapidly expand charging infrastructure where it is needed the most. In addition to building out fast
chargers (see recommendation 13), ACCD and ANR should engage all partners to identify priority
sectors for VW investment. Attention and priority should also be given to building charging
infrastructure on interstate corridors and between Canada and other states. Coordination with utilities,
charging companies, private site hosts and Electrify America will ensure VW investments are
maximized. In addition, outreach materials should be developed to make it easy for potential

VTrans (transit providers)

Background:
The significantly higher up-front purchase price of electric buses is a barrier to the electrification of the
public transit sector. There are finance strategies that leverage fuel and operational savings to pay off
loans and there is an opportunity to maximize VW settlement funding to support this focus. More
research is needed to identify finance models that will work for Vermont’s transit operators. In
addition, the State and transit operators should continue to pursue federal and utility sources to fund the
incremental cost of electric transit buses.

their kids to school are that school buses are unpleasant, unsafe, and take too long and that roads are
not safe for kids to bike and walk on. With Vermont’s move to consolidate school districts, it’s a good
time to examine school transportation in the context of what efficiencies can be found that also
improve student and community health and wellbeing.

Background:
The 2016 CEP states, “one successful alternative is to have employees choose cash instead of a free
parking space, a practice known as cash-out.” The State of California has made parking cash-out
required for employers with greater than 50 employees. Studies of employers who have switched to a
cash-out system have experienced an average VMT reduction of 12 percent. As the biggest employer in
Vermont, the State has an opportunity to employ this strategy to help reduce VMTs and should
consider a pilot “parking subsidy cash-out program” in high demand locations. The Capital Commuters
program began in July 2013 as a three-year pilot project to reduce transportation and parking demands
that face State of Vermont employees based in Montpelier. Overall, the program reduced energy use
and parking demands during its first three years. Such programs that support commuter habits improve
GHG reductions and health outcomes.

C. Communities and Landscapes
The Vermont brand evokes strong images of working lands and thriving town centers. For
decades, Vermont has attracted tourists with beautiful natural and working landscapes
surrounding quaint downtowns and village centers. These iconic images, however, represent
more than marketing iconography. They represent Vermont’s competitive advantage in creating
economic opportunity and resilience in the face of a changing climate.
To answer the greenhouse gas reduction component of our charge, Vermont must use its finite
lands, natural systems, and built environment more efficiently. Land is the base resource from
which community prosperity is built and sustained. Vital to the success of the recommendations
discussed in the sections above is how we intentionally use land resources. We must strengthen
compact development patterns, known as “smart growth,” to enable efficient use of
transportation and building energy while fostering strong and thriving communities. Central to
smart growth is that the transportation system is a means of creating prosperity in a community,
not an end unto itself.
Achieving Smart Growth
Smart growth represents an approach to land use that incorporates vital and compact city, town,
and village centers surrounded by working farms, forests, and open space. This development
pattern is more energy-efficient, environmentally sustainable, and economically responsible than
the sprawling, auto-oriented patterns that defined the second half of the 20th century. Smart
growth also provides a solid foundation to prepare and adapt Vermont’s landscape for climate
change.
Smart growth is energy efficient because it creates more housing choices close to jobs, stores,
services, and schools, which encourages more walking and biking and makes public transit work
better. Supporting this type of development means fewer vehicle miles traveled. That reduces
greenhouse gas emissions, creates cleaner water and air, saves energy and money, and helps us
meet the efficiency goals in the state’s Comprehensive Energy Plan and Regional Energy Plans.
Additionally, compact development is often less intense to heat and cool – and can enable highefficiency district heating options that simply are too expensive in more dispersed development.
Our scenic and working lands also provide critical environmental functions and provide
economic vitality. Focusing growth in city, town, and village centers reduces development that
fragments agricultural and arboreal landscapes. Large forest blocks, for example, clean and
protect the water supply, minimize erosion, store flood waters, provide wildlife habitat, clean the
air, capture carbon, provide outdoor recreation, and maintain Vermont’s landscape. Farms and
forests also provide food and cover for wildlife, help control flooding, and protect wetlands.
Protecting large blocks of productive agricultural soils and connected forest lands is critical to
help Vermonters and wildlife adapt to climate change.
Not only does smart growth reduce our carbon footprint, it also creates economic activity and
saves taxpayers money. Smart growth communities are better able to offer amenities that grow
healthy kids and empower seniors to age in place, and most importantly, they have a community-

- 42 -



oriented form that attracts educated and skilled workers.5 These workers are strongly associated
with economic performance and prosperity. Job creation and economic growth are the results of
a healthy local economy, not substitutes for one.
The State, Vermont households, and Vermont municipalities can realize significant capital,
operational, and maintenance savings by growing smartly. Smart growth reduces initial and
ongoing costs Vermonters pay to provide and maintain public infrastructure, facilities and
municipal services through efficient economies of scale. Compact development is a wise
investment: it means more subscribers per linear foot of sewer and water line, more children
served per mile of bus route, fewer trips that must be taken by vehicle, and more efficient public
safety response time. Bottom line: development of compact centers surrounded by working and
natural lands generates more public wealth and costs less to service than the sprawl alternative.
Financial solvency isn’t an afterthought – it is a prerequisite to long-term prosperity. Smart
growth accounts for revenues, expenses, assets, and long-term liabilities.
Demographic change, greenhouse gas emissions, severe weather, and financial challenges
prompt a fresh look at Vermont’s smart growth strategies and land use governance as means to
address climate change. Smart growth works when development goals, investments, and
regulatory structures align to make Vermont’s centers attractive places to live, work, and play,
while ensuring the viability of farm and forest landscapes, and natural-systems functions outside
of centers.
Vermont has planned for and sought the implementation of smart growth principles for decades,
but we have failed to implement the many plans that have been written over the years. The
recommendations below propose to focus almost exclusively on leading us to actual smart
growth on the ground.
The Commission recognizes that one obstacle for prioritizing such strategies for greenhouse gas
reduction is that it can be challenging to do the math and measure the causal impacts of smart
growth development patterns. This is the case partly due to available information, but also
because development moves at a slower pace when compared with technological solutions that
evolve more rapidly and demonstrate, on paper, a fast return on investment. Nevertheless, the
Commission recognizes that Vermont’s underlying land use pattern will ultimately make new
technologies and other energy saving strategies far more successful than they would be if
developed in isolation.
The smart growth and land use initiatives included below represent an important, foundational
set of strategies to adapt to climate change and start reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Changing land use patterns is a long-term undertaking. Investing in these basic steps now is
essential.
This package of actions is the foundation. The Commission recognizes that additional work by
State agencies will be needed to develop further innovations in this area and measure and
communicate the long-term greenhouse gas reduction benefits of smart growth investments.

Communities and Landscapes Recommendations
The “Communities and Landscapes” work group recognizes the strong link between settlement
patterns and the required use of energy for both transportation and buildings. However, the
specific link between particular smart growth strategies and energy use reduction are not known
at this time and are a part of the reason for the recommendations to develop indicators and
metrics. With the development and reporting of these measures, decision makers will have better
tools to make the connections between land use decisions and greenhouse gas emissions. It is our
intent that future plans for addressing climate change through smart growth principles will be
informed by the indicators and metrics.

Behavioral patterns, social circumstances, and environmental exposures account for 60 percent of
health outcomes, with genetic predisposition accounting for 30 percent. Even though healthcare only
contributes to 10 percent of health outcomes, over $2 billion was spent in Vermont in 2016 to treat
largely preventable chronic diseases. Smart growth increases opportunities for physical activity,
reduces risk of transportation-related injuries, increases access to healthy food, and provides equitable
access to education, employment, and vital services. Recognizing this, the public health sector has
stepped up its efforts to promote healthy, active communities, which often also supports smart growth
strategies. One example is the ongoing work of the Healthy Communities and 3-4-50 programs at the
Health Department; a newer example is the RiseVT initiative. As the health care system shifts to a
more prevention-focused approach, hospitals and other health care providers should be key partners

Maintenance of large blocks of economically viable, working forestland discourages forest parcellation

forestland is privately owned and will change hands in the coming decades; supporting programs that
facilitate land transfer without parcellation is critical. Implementation of the Act 171 intergenerational

areas and to plan for development in these areas to minimize forest fragmentation. ANR, ACCD and
VNRC have already developed model bylaws, written guidance and a webinar on ways to implement
Act 171 to maintain a resilient landscape. In addition, Vermont’s land use statutes strive to ensure that
the design and construction of development in floodplains, river corridors, and other hazard areas are
accomplished in a manner that minimizes or eliminates the potential for flood and loss or damage to
life and property in a flood hazard area fluvial erosion in in a river corridor protection area. Together,
these natural resource planning requirements support smart growth and provide a framework to
promote climate change resilient communities, but action is needed to improve staff resources and the
implementation of strategies to accomplish the planning goals. Providing increased technical
assistance to local planners and land use regulators is cost-effective and feasible; however, passing and

regulatory structure. In addition, the maintenance of rural working lands and important natural
resources are often hindered by gaps in the regulatory structure. The Commission supports the
evaluation of challenges associated with redeveloping downtowns as well as protecting important
natural resources and working lands that are critical to adapting to a changing climate with the goal of
achieving comparable protections in a manner that flips the current paradigm where greenfield
development is easier and cheaper than in areas that are targeted for concentrated growth.

D. Sequestering Carbon on Vermont’s Farms and in Its Forests
Vermont’s working lands can be managed to “reverse” greenhouse gas emissions, and it’s
already occurring in places. With Vermont’s traditional land uses of farming and forestry,
Vermonters who manage those lands can reap a variety of benefits while accumulating carbon in
the soil.
Primarily composed of carbon, the organic matter in soils plays a role in four important
ecosystem services: resistance to soil erosion, soil water-holding capacity, soil fertility for plants,
and soil biodiversity. Around the world, efforts are being targeted at decreasing soil disturbance,
reducing erosion, increasing organic matter inputs to soil through crop residues and organic
nutrient sources, and maintaining continuous living plant cover as much as possible throughout
the year.
Over the last decade, adoption by Vermont farmers of these soil-building practices has resulted
in the rebuilding of soil health. These soil health improvements have the co-benefits of
improving water quality and enhancing flood resiliency while increasing sequestered carbon in
the soil and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural lands. New regulations
(Vermont Clean Water Act) have promoted these practices for their water quality value and have
increased funding for implementation and education. Vermont farmers also lead in trying
innovative practices like a roller crimper that increases the return of organic matter in cover crop
residues to a field, with lower chemical inputs.
These practices also provide longer term benefits to farmers by enhancing productivity,
decreasing fuel and fertilizer costs, and reducing volatility of weather-related yield swings –
essentially creating cropping systems that are more resilient to the impacts of climate change.
Many farmers have adopted these practices voluntarily, but there is still a financial cost to farm
businesses. It is critical that these practices continue, once implemented, as research shows
reverting to previous conditions can quickly reverse nearly all the prior gains. Since the potential
for capturing annual CO2 emissions, both locally and globally, through agriculture is high, and so
clearly connected to other co-benefits, our policies must be designed to support the transition to
these practices. Education and demonstration of such conservation practices that allow for
farmer-to-farmer communication are also critical for increased adoption and have been shown to
one of the most effective means of changing management. Recent studies (Galik, et al., 2018)
have suggested that policies that promote early action can promote innovation and reduce the
lags in benefits associated with inaction.
Opportunity: Carbon in Our Forests
Forests cover roughly 78 percent of the land area of state. They are also a major carbon store or
“sink” – both above and below ground. Estimates suggest more than half our state’s annual CO2
emissions are being absorbed by the annual growth of these forests, and over 200 years of
emissions are stored there. Recent data indicate our net annual sequestration is declining
slightly, and – for the first time in over 100 years – our forested land base is declining (Morin, et
al. 2017). While these data suggest our forests are changing, the reasons for that change are
complex. One aspect of the future is relatively certain: climate change will increase management
costs for forest landowners from a host of expected impacts including invasive plants and insect
control, increased drainage and road infrastructure costs, storm damage, and potential reductions
- 54 -



in health and productivity. To climate impacts add increasing property taxes, parcellization,
weakening markets, and the shifting demographics of ownership and the stability of our future
forest land base becomes even less secure.
Already risky and marginal, the profitability of forest ownership is likely to decline, jeopardizing
many of the benefits we have come to expect from our forests – benefits that include clean air,
clean water, flood resilience, and carbon storage, along with more conventional forest products.
Vermont has been proactive in informing both landowners and policy makers about this growing
list of threats. Forest managers have access to regular reporting on forest health and markets.
Planners have new legislative mandates requiring they consider the benefits of forests in regional
and municipal plans. Workshops encouraging planning for ownership succession are ongoing.
The Department of Forest, Parks, and Recreation has developed a suite of tools supporting the
adaptation of management in the face of a changing climate. However, none of these laudable
actions generate additional revenues to landowners.
One alternative revenue stream is gaining ground in much of the country: programs that allow
for forest landowners to monetize forest growth as carbon offsets – generating payments for
some of the ecosystem services forests provide. Carbon offset programs not only promote
additional sequestration, but by providing a new annual income stream to landowners may well
play a role in keeping the major forest carbon sink intact. As with agriculture, co-benefits from
habitat protection and sustainable management are additional dividends to the public. Yet,
turning carbon in trees into a fungible “security” is far from simple. Program rules are
complicated, and the expertise required to develop forest carbon projects is expensive. Larger
tracts (more carbon revenue) cover more of these fixed costs, which partially explains why most
projects have occurred where parcel size is larger or growth is faster, compared to Vermont.
Only one forest carbon project has been initiated in Vermont to date.
Managing forests for carbon sequestration is compatible with all other forms of responsible
forest management. The potential for income from trading forest carbon offsets is likely to
continue to generate interest, both from policy makers and landowners. Nationally, forest carbon
offsets from across the country supply the bulk of traded offsets for the California cap and trade
mechanism. Whether these programs will continue to grow is unclear, but of all the types of
offsets available, forest-based offsets display substantial demand and some of the highest prices.
The potential loss of carbon from the loss of forestland is real and substantial. Every acre of
forest lost to development has the potential to release a hundred metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent into the atmosphere – like adding 25 cars for a year.
The carbon in our forest soils is relatively stable, presuming soil disturbance is minimized and
the forest growing above remains reasonably intact. For decades, the “live” carbon in Vermont
forests have seen a positive net change. Growth of biomass consistently exceeds loss from
mortality and harvesting, consistently extracting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and
converting it into solid carbon. Research is ongoing regarding optimal management strategies
that balance both the preservation of the sink and sequestration from growth. In all likelihood,
the introduction of offset trading will not have major effects on either the level of currently

sequestered carbon or the accretion of additional carbon through growth. It would reward
landowners who protect the existing carbon and for new sequestration.
Vision: Increased Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Forestry
In the Commission’s view, the opportunity for an evolving relationship with our working lands
suggests a vision for the future that embodies action. Landowners of agricultural and forest land
embrace the role their management plays in the mitigation of climate change impacts.
Information about the scale and extent of their impact is evident and informs their actions to
preserve stored carbon in trees and soil and adopt practices that increase carbon sequestration.
They are motivated by ethical, practical, and financial incentives. In addition, they understand
that Vermonters value their contribution to efforts that meet State greenhouse gas emission
reduction goals while providing co-benefits, including protection of Vermont’s surface and
ground water and flood resilience.
Achieving the Vision of Increased Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture and Forestry
I.

Agriculture

Our recommendations identify key leverage points and policy actions needed to systematically
recognize and advance the existing and potential contributions of agriculture to achieve the
State’s climate goals. The goals stated in the CEP include reducing greenhouse gas within the
state and from outside the state’s boundaries caused by using of energy within the state by 50
percent by 2028 and 75 percent by 2050. To a large extent, sequestration, or “reverse emissions,”
are overlooked. The CEP mentions carbon sequestration mainly in the context of forests.
Agricultural practices that can increase carbon sequestration in soils can be significant, as can the
contribution of both forestry and agriculture to our climate goals, especially given the many cobenefits.
Extrapolating under reasonable assumptions6, practices that promote carbon storage in
agricultural soils have the potential to offset two percent of our annual state emissions.
II.

Forestry

The CEP recognizes the importance of intact forests and discusses the role of wood fuel for heat
and energy. The CEP does not acknowledge the role of or the potential for sequestration in
Vermont forests, though it does acknowledge the forests as a carbon sink. The Commission will
identify actions the legislature and administration can undertake to support and promote
additional sequestration in forests by landowners and communities. It will also consider
recommendations that promote maintaining and enhancing the value of the large carbon sink
represented by our current forests.

6

Our analysis assumes a 1 percent annual increase in organic matter per year across a distribution of soil types and
practices. We also assumed these practices would be achieved on roughly one-third of agricultural acres and be
sustained for a period of 20 years. Across all soils, this resulted in average carbon per acre changing from 25 to 30
tons over the 20-year period.

Sequestering Carbon Recommendations
The recommendations below are prioritized in the following way:
•
•
•
•

Get a baseline of carbon sequestration and set goals in State planning documents
Look to market-based mechanisms for the sale of carbon credits from sequestration
Track rates of carbon sequestration occurring through water-quality initiatives and
payments
Maintain current forested land:
o maintain water-quality initiatives and emphasize the benefits of sequestration for
soil health and flood resilience
o Keep forested land forested– avoid conversion of forests for development

The Commission identified that certain agricultural practices allow for the accumulation of
organic matter that results in carbon stored in agricultural soils. If these practices are put in place
across the 170,000 acres of currently managed farmlands, carbon sequestration can take place at
the rate of greater than 50,000 metric tons per year.

Expand outreach efforts to incorporate sequestration

UVM Ext. and AAFM

Background:
By documenting contributions, the State acknowledges and legitimizes these practices—an important
step in changing the current agricultural paradigm. Farmers will be motivated knowing that the State
acknowledges importance of practices. The best practice guide augments the existing technical
assistance necessary for farmers to make appropriate decisions to enhance carbon sequestration in their
soils. Documenting the value of agricultural contributions to climate change mitigation is necessary to
ensure the continued support for implementation. Vermont is one of the few states that targets
agriculture with its Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture in Vermont (2010), yet neither
the Comprehensive Energy Plan nor Vermont’s Climate Change Adaptation Framework (2013) include
substantial recommendations for agriculture. These guiding documents need to be expanded and
brought up-to-date to include the substantial contributions of agriculture, including the multiple
benefits, to help ensure the continuation of funding and support to the farming community and support
State, regional and municipal planners.

Background:
Carbon offsets are emerging as a potential mechanism to reward landowners for activities that
sequester carbon. There are options for both agricultural and forest lands, but the market for forest
offsets is more mature and robust. An initiative led by the Vermont Land Trust and UVM’s
Rubenstein School is working to develop a “pilot” project to demonstrate the feasibility of carbon
offsets trading for smaller private forest landowners in Vermont. There is considerable interest on the
part of landowners, yet these carbon projects are complex. This pilot will inform the potential for the
sale of offsets to increase landowner income, and its potential as a new conservation finance tool. This
pilot represents an opportunity for state land managers to participate and answer questions that affect
the feasibility of similar projects, either on other private lands (for example, compatibility with the
Current Use rules) or on State lands. As the trading of forest carbon offsets becomes more common,
county foresters and state land managers will need to have the information and experience to interpret
current rules and mandates for landowners. AAFM and FPR along with the ACCD should evaluate the
potential for a fund that would mitigate the risk of investments in these programs, in the hopes of
attracting capital to support private efforts. The results of this review can become the basis for
recommendations to the State legislature for targeted funding.

ANR (NRCS, UVM, and
AAFM)

Background:
Developing a baseline will allow us to understand how much carbon sequestration is to be gained with
supporting management practices. This research will help determine the value of this work and
subsequently appropriate allotment of resources. In addition, a baseline will assist with tracking, see
next recommendation. The phosphorus reduction value of various agricultural practices has been
quantified; however, no baseline has been set for the sequestration value of these same practices. Until
this is done, quantifying the value of future implementation opportunities is challenging. Based on the
modeling estimates of the Lake Champlain TMDL and estimates by USDA/Natural Resources
Conservation Service sub-watershed planning, it is reasonable to assume the potential for a minimum
40-50 percent increase in water-quality and carbon friendly practices over the next ten years. Various
UVM departments are involved in research related to the current stocks and stability of those stocks in
both agricultural and forest soils, yet this research has yet to provide estimates of where the greatest
potential to add carbon can be found, and what land use practices are most likely to return the greatest
benefits. We envision this research coming together in a tool that integrates soil science and economics
(that is, costs to implement) to support better farmer decision making. For that to happen we need a
consistent and expanded accounting system to identify and track benefits. The State of Vermont
should lead in the development and funding of an evaluation of the tradeoffs and co-benefits associated
with different adaptation and mitigation actions and agricultural practices, specific to Vermont soils,
crops, and weather to ensure that decision makers, from policy leaders to farmers, have a
comprehensive perspective on their options for responding to climate change.

Background:
Tracking carbon sequestration will provide a measure of progress that in turn secures support for this
effort as well as facilitating increased rates of adoption. The measure of progress can be used to
identify successful land management strategies for broader adoption. In addition, financial incentives
can easily be calculated to reflect carbon sequestration, creating opportunities for additional financial
resources, e.g. offset program. VT DEC is required to provide regular documentation to the EPA
regarding progress in meeting the State’s water quality goals through the Lake Champlain TMDL and
the Act 64, Vermont’s Clean Water Act. Many of the practices tracked in this effort are the same as
those proposed as carbon-friendly, and the State must provide the resources to additionally include the
sequestration benefits of these practices or develop a method to efficiently use the water quality data
already summarized. This includes not only practices implemented with the assistance of State or
federal dollars, but also those done voluntarily by farmers around the state. An alignment of practice
adoption levels for water quality goals with those for climate change mitigation goals will demonstrate
additional value of investments in related programs.

UVM

Background:
Farmers will be motivated to adopt carbon sequestration practices where economic benefits exist. In
addition, farmers will also be motivated where community approval exists, and surveys show that
currently, the co-benefit of improving water quality is a community concern for Vermonters. The
University of Vermont Extension System has done extensive work to quantify the financial costs and
returns to farmers for implementation of these carbon-friendly practices, but the sequestration benefits
have not been as widely shared with the agricultural community as the water quality benefits. A
priority should be on systematically sharing with farmers a comprehensive package of costs and
benefits to each practice to help influence implementation and quantify the cost-benefit to the State. In
addition, further research is needed to confirm how advocated management changes impact soil carbon
storage and GHG emissions. Farmers who value mitigation benefits are willing to invest financial
capital towards adaptive and mitigating practices when their farm is economically successful.
However, when finances are tight, investments are not made toward mitigation. Economic and
livelihood analysis of how financial and other livelihood assets drive and limit investment into
resilience and mitigation on farms will be crucial to policy makers who wish to encourage mitigation.

Background:
Trees in urban and suburban environments provide well documented energy-saving and health benefits,
in addition to removing atmospheric carbon. New urban tree planting on public and private land will
be especially critical in the coming years, as Emerald Ash Borer is expected to eventually result in the
loss of most ash trees in Vermont, which presents significant challenges as ash is a popular urban tree.
By supporting tree planting in specific environments, this program can provide the greatest net benefits
for the most affected communities. These projects are visible and engaging, offering many
opportunities for participants to learn about the benefits of trees and tree care. The Vermont Urban &
Community Forestry and Climate & Health Programs partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation in
2017 and 2018 to pilot an Energy-Saving Trees Program with residents of urban communities in
Vermont. In 2018, a $10,000 investment provided 300 trees to predominantly low-to-moderate income
residents in Barre and Rutland. The estimated 20-year benefit (based on i-Tree analysis) is over
$90,000, attributable to reduced building energy usage, carbon sequestration and avoided GHG
emissions, storm-water filtration, and air pollution reduction. The estimated average energy cost
savings over 20 years is $335 per program participant, and the estimated 20-year reduction in
atmospheric carbon is 162 metric tons.

Background:
When farm income is below the cost of production, voluntary practices often cease, resulting in the loss
of the benefits gained. Securing consistent and long-term funding for these multi-purpose practices is a
priority. Agricultural practices that improve water quality and store carbon have multiple benefits.
Cover crops and reduced tillage decrease soil erosion, improve soil health and crop management, and
increase flood resiliency by improving soil infiltration. The continued implementation may reduce
some costs (for example, equipment and fuel), but implementation likely comes at a net cost to the
farmer--cover crop seeding, cover crop termination in the spring, and purchase of new equipment for
changes in tillage practices are among the required investments. Funding for implementation of these
practices is relatively robust through 2020, however, a precipitous drop is expected that will reduce not
only the implementation of new practices, but also threaten the continuation of ones already in place.
Dairy milk prices are volatile and at a dramatic low in 2018, with little improvement expected in 2019.
Long-term funding pays for more acreage of water-quality improvement and also for ongoing
implementation of current practices. There are extensive opportunities to leverage funds that are
available for water quality improvement efforts and use these to also support the additional
sequestration benefits.

E. Jobs and the Economy
Vermont continues to lead the nation in modeling best practices in responding to growing
greenhouse gas emissions and reducing human-caused carbon emissions. The Climate Action
Commission believes the state is primed to marry these efforts with private, entrepreneurial
efforts to create and grow a new climate economy.
The climate economy is largely defined by the economic responses aimed at reducing carbon
emissions and accommodating to the realities of a climate-changed world. It is a large, growing
portion of the economy. However, the Commission chose to focus primarily on the economic
activities that are related to carbon emissions when considering how best to grow jobs related to
the climate economy. While there are legitimate arguments that expand the climate economy
definition to topics such as waste reduction, localized agriculture, and advanced manufacturing,
the Commission focused on what it believed to be the largest and most immediate opportunity to
grow jobs in Vermont.
The Climate Economy Baseline
Vermonters spend more than $2 billion dollars on energy services that include the purchase of:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

310 million gallons of gasoline
70 million gallons of diesel fuel for transportation
130 million gallons of heating oil for residential, commercial and industrial purposes
100 million gallons of propane for residential, commercial and industrial purposes
12.2 trillion BTU of natural gas for residential, commercial and industrial purposes
4.5 billion kWh of electricity – some generated locally, some imported from other states
and Quebec
7.5 trillion BTU of wood for process and building heat

During the last period of higher fossil fuel prices (2014), Vermonters spent close to $3 billion on
energy. The subsequent reduction in the price of oil due to global market conditions has resulted
in savings to Vermont businesses and homeowners of several hundred million dollars each year.
The possibility of a return to higher petroleum prices is a factor not to be dismissed lightly in
that those hundreds of millions of dollars currently available for other purchases could be lost
again.
As noted in other portions of this report, there are many areas where Vermonters and Vermont
entrepreneurs are participating in the climate economy, including:
Homes and Workplaces
•
•
•
•

Weatherization to reduce the need for heating fuels
Electrification of heating through heat pumps
Installation of advanced wood heating systems

Utilizing Vermont’s forests for renewable energy fuels
The choice of home and business location as an important factor in directing the future
delivery and use of energy

The Business of Clean Energy
Many of the recommendations in this report have the potential to spur economic opportunities
for entrepreneurs and for Vermonters. However, most of the recommendations focus on
consumer-facing, demand creation – with an eye on creating a market with the assumption that
jobs and private economic investment will occur. Incentives and policies increase the demand
for weatherization, heat pumps, electric vehicles, solar panels, and transit. Businesses providing
those goods and services receive a benefit by the increase in demand. Perhaps the most recent
example of a successful demand-driven incentive has been the expansion of solar in Vermont.
To complement the many demand-side enhancements in this report, the Commission’s Climate
Economy work group focused on the support of bold supply-focused recommendations that will
create an ecosystem that supports the creation and growth of climate economy businesses.
Fostering additional job growth requires a focus on matching the familiar challenges of climate
economy businesses with the competitive advantages Vermont’s energy sector and business
ecosystem either already possesses or could possess with deliberate action. The Commission
recognizes that while we must do everything we can to create an environment where climate
economy entrepreneurs from across the globe would consider Vermont, our highest success will
come from helping Vermont-based businesses grow. Vermont ideas turn into Vermont start-ups,
and Vermont start-ups turn into Vermont scale-ups.
As such the Commission focused on two parts of the Climate Economy that are well established
and primed for expansion:
1) Clean Grid Modernization
2) Expansion of Advanced Wood Heat Production Facilities
Defining Clean Grid Modernization Businesses
Clean grid modernization businesses can be defined as businesses that relate to the creation and
utilization of a smart grid – a more communicative and responsive grid that allows for more
efficient generation, storage, transmission, and use of electricity. Vermont, with its near
ubiquitous installation of smart meters and distributed energy generation assets, offers clean grid
modernization businesses an ideal place to do research, apply their technology, and grow their
business. The state currently has nationally recognized leaders in clean grid modernization,
including our utilities, newly-established energy storage companies, start-up smart-grid
utilization companies, and dozens of renewable energy companies.

- 68 -



Distributed renewable generation production businesses benefit from an improved grid
infrastructure. Since the early introduction of distributed generation, many economic benefits
related to electricity demand peaks and reducing high price spot purchases have been captured,
and to meet the State’s renewable generation goals, there is the need for expanded renewable
generation. Furthermore, distributed generation provides job-creating opportunities and reduces
the flow of money out of state to pay for remote generation resources.
Clean grid modernization works in tandem with distributed generation. New generation supplies
require a modern grid with demand controls and storage capacity to best utilize the new
generation. The use of storage batteries in grid modernization benefits from more distributed
generation to provide supply during periods of recharge.
Supply constraints and grid weaknesses in certain regions are an additional feature addressed by
clean grid modernization. Strategically siting new distributed generation resources will benefit
the grid.
To achieve this new energy future, businesses should continue to grow in a way that does not
drive up costs for utility customers and provides value so we can continue to see benefits.
Expanding Advanced Wood Heat Production Facilities
The working group recognized that renewable energy production has created thousands of jobs
in Vermont – especially in connection with a national expansion of solar installation, sales and
servicing jobs. However, the working group felt that the state should be focusing additional
efforts into the expansion of an often-overlooked renewable sector – advanced wood heat. The
harvesting, processing and use of Vermont’s forests as wood pellets in homes and businesses
across the region has the potential to reduce our state’s greenhouse gas emissions, increase
forestry jobs, and provide landowners with income to support good management practices.
There is an obvious nexus between Vermont’s existing natural assets, this growing sector, and
the climate economy.
Supporting Clean Grid Modernization Businesses
The Commission proposes implementing systems that meet the following clean grid
modernization goals:
•

•
•
•
•

With better managed electricity, enabled by grid modernization, the overall costs of
delivery of electricity have the potential to be reduced 5 percent (about $35 million per
year) compared to a Business as Usual scenario.
The Clean Grid modernization businesses will have 200 employees (in addition to the
jobs associated with the Distributed Generation businesses). Total salaries at $15 million
(expansion of services into other states will be above and beyond this amount)
10 percent of current electricity sales increase in distributed energy generation in next
five years (reducing out of state purchases by that same 10 percent - some portion of that
from non-renewable sources)
Capital investment at $100 million for grid modernization with a significant portion of
the costs for battery storage plus additional investment in distributed generation
Ratepayer savings approximately $10 million per year

- 69 -



The Commission recommends making several structural changes that will incentivize and
accelerate clean grid modernization entrepreneurial growth.
Expanding Advanced Wood Heat Production Facilities
The Climate Economy work group supports the efforts of the Buildings Work Group to provide
incentives to building owners to install modern wood heat infrastructure. This approach will
incentivize growth in the sector by generating demand. The following recommendations reduce
the barriers to the creation and expansion of advanced wood heating fuel facilities on the supply
side.
The Climate Commission proposes to meet the following benchmarks over the next five years:
•
•
•
•
•

100,000 tons annual production within Vermont – wholesale value $20 million (retail
$25-30 million)
200,000 tons pulp wood purchase from Vermont loggers – value $5 million
The wood pellet businesses will have 200 employees (plus 50 jobs associated with
logging). Total salaries at $10 million.
Capital investment at $60 million
Reduced out of state fuel purchases of $25 - $40 million annually depending on price of
fuel oil (if all replacement fuel oil – reduced fuel oil use of 12 million gallons)

Current wood pellet production faces significant competitive pressures from parts of the US and
Canada that have lower costs for production. To reduce costs for Vermont producers, the
Commission recommends a series of strategies:

- 70 -



Climate Economy Recommendations:
The Jobs and Economy working group identified two specific business activities that show great
promise for both addressing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting Vermont business
activities. The Clean Grid Modernization sector can result in the reduction of 100,000 metric
tons per year of carbon dioxide equivalents when the utilities and their customers shift demand
and increase renewable generation.
The expansion of Advanced Wood Heat production facilities (wood pellets) has an uncertain
impact on greenhouse gas emissions depending on the role of that new production in
encouraging new Vermont customers to use advanced wood heat and how much displaces the
purchase of out-of-state pellets.

Background:
Clean Grid Modernization businesses, especially those using smart grid data to drive down costs for all
customers, need a system in place to enable the transformation. The system can include appropriate
price signals to consumers about when they should or shouldn’t use electricity or also more innovative
approaches to deliver savings seamlessly. Smart devices, renewable generation assets and storage
companies all need a dynamic electricity pricing system to succeed.

PSD

Background:
The state’s success at becoming one of the first nearly ubiquitous smart grids is a unique Vermont
asset. The Commission heard from several businesses that participated in the Vermont Sustainable
Jobs Fund Accel-VT climate economy accelerator that their access to the utilities and the grid was
especially attractive and a potential determining factor to doing business in Vermont. Enabling clean
grid modernization businesses access to the entire state’s smart grid data could create a new incentive
to doing business in Vermont and be cost-effective for ratepayers.

Background:
Create a new fund that provides equity investments for target climate economy businesses to encourage
the growth of the sector. The fund should be modeled on the Working Lands Enterprise Initiative,
which provides small grants to private entrepreneurs and non-profit groups to create jobs in the
agriculture sector. Eligible expenses should include product development, start-up costs, equipment
purchases, and talent acquisition in distributed energy, grid modernization, and energy storage startups. Many start-up climate economy businesses are attracted to larger cities where equity capital is
more available, and this grant program would provide a unique Vermont advantage at a Vermont scale.
The Commission recommends that initial capitalization of this fund equals $1 million.

3. Draft and promote legislative changes for programs

ACCD

Background:
Incentivize target businesses to do research and technology commercialization in Vermont by
providing a State match to the existing federal Small Business Innovation Research grant program.
Eleven federal agencies, including the Department of Energy, are required to dedicate 3.2 percent of
their research and development budget to small businesses. Companies can apply for as much as $1
million to conduct research in partnership with the federal agency. In the past 35 years, Vermont
companies have received approximately $130 million in federal SBIR awards. The State could
encourage Vermont businesses to utilize the program by providing a small match to any SBIR award
made to conduct distributed generation, energy storage, and grid modernization work. In addition,
non-Vermont businesses may choose to do their research here in Vermont, resulting in more start-ups
being located here in Vermont. The Commission recommends a $100,000 annual investment

future tax expenditures

ACCD

3. Pass legislation and enact into law

Legislature and Governor
Background:

The current VEGI program provides a cash incentive one to nine years after a specified employment
and capital investment target is met. For businesses in this sector, our proposal is to front load the
payments at the time of employment and investment (with real-time monitoring to ensure that the
positions are maintained). Another aspect of VEGI is that the incentive value is decreased based on an
assumption of background growth – growth presumed to take place in the absence of any incentive
payment. Start-up businesses and high growth businesses struggle to overcome background growth
requirements. If a company of one person hires one person, the 100 percent growth often disqualifies a
company from the program. Mid-size, faster growing companies, like those in the tech industry, often
need to exceed unattainable growth figures to qualify. To enhance the VEGI program for target
climate economy businesses, we propose to assign a zero rate of background growth to calculate
incentive payments. The Commission recommends a $200,000 annual investment in this enhancement.

The existing Vermont credit provides tax benefit for conducting research in Vermont, but that credit is
only available to companies that meet federal requirements and have an existing Vermont income tax
liability (corporate or personal for pass-through businesses). Many start-up companies wait years to be
profitable. By making the tax credit fully refundable for distributed energy, grid modernization, and
energy storage businesses, Vermont could become the preferred destination to conduct research and
development in the sector. The Commission estimates that this would cost $100,000 annually.

businesses in this sector will receive a partial loan forgiveness for each year that they hold the job. In
addition, students that pursue an academic field of study that prepares them for work in the clean grid
modernization field will also be eligible for debt forgiveness. The Commission estimates that this
would cost $100,000 annually

2. Develop marketing materials for VLSell to be used in the clean
energy business space

VLS and ACCD

3. Provide an appropriation to support VLSell

Legislature and Governor

Background:
One critical area of support for new and emerging clean energy businesses, including clean tech and
grid modernization businesses, is intellectual property and corporate legal services. Legal services for
new businesses to support formation of the appropriate legal entities, structure outside investment, and
even file for an Employee Identification Number can range from $6,000 to $20,000, placing a
significant burden on new and emerging businesses at the time when they can least afford such capital
outlays. Further, for clean technology companies or others developing new products, intellectual
property legal services such as applying for a patent can be as high as $20,000. In September 2018,
Vermont Law School will launch a new Entrepreneurship and Legal Laboratory (VLSell). This
program will eliminate barriers to growth for early-stage companies in Vermont by providing low-cost
or pro bono legal services. Legal services will be rendered by students, supervised by experienced legal
practitioners. This program meets a need that all new and expanding businesses share, particularly
businesses in the new climate economy sector who face complex legal challenges. The Commission
recommends $50,000 in funding support for the VLSell to provide low-cost and pro bono legal services
to start-up businesses in the clean technology, energy, and grid modernization sectors. This funding
will allow VLSell to specifically assist businesses in these sectors, addressing one of the critical
barriers to growth that they face.

Background:
Vermont’s relatively high-cost of electricity is a deterrent to attracting new high-energy using
manufacturers. Though the State has a process enabling businesses to apply for a reduced economicdevelopment rate to encourage load expansion and job creation, the program is rarely used. The
Commission recommends creating a new, enhanced rate reduction for wood pellet manufacturers
recognizing the benefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions provided by advanced wood heat and the
potential to grow the green economy.

2. Make a legislative recommendation for a clean energy industrial
park designation program

ACCD (ANR)

Background:
The State’s permitting process can be costly and time consuming, often resulting in hundreds of
thousands of dollars and many months of delay. The Commission recommends creating a new
designation program that would encourage clean energy, climate economy, and wood pellet production
facilities to locate in areas the state, municipality, economic development experts, and land use
planners agree is the best place for growth. In return for locating in a designated area, permitting costs
and hurdles would be reduced, if not eliminated, allowing for a more cost effective citing process and a
more predictable process.

III. Continuing Citizen Climate Participation
The Vermont Climate Action Commission has taken its charge of developing recommended
actions seriously. The process has involved and engaged the broader public in a meaningful
way. To achieve Vermont’s ambitious but necessary climate goals, the entire population must be
engaged in the solution. The scale of the challenge and opportunity it presents is that large.
The Commission believes it is vital to take the recommendations in this report and other related
climate actions and begin implementing them as soon as possible. Though the implementation
will include leadership from the private, municipal, educational, and non-profit sectors, the
primary force for implementation will come from the State. The Commission has identified lead
organizations for implementation in all of its recommendations, but there is an important need
for consistent interagency collaboration and coordination.
The Commission believes that State agency collaboration should be formalized and a new citizen
group should be formed to enhance, advise, and provide feedback to State agencies as they
implement supported recommendations. The Commission proposes that the Governor issue a
new Executive Order to create an interagency implementation working group that would be
advisory to the Governor and his cabinet and be supported by a climate advisory council.
Maintaining a consistent voice for Vermonters in the implementation will ensure that we
continue to make progress toward solutions that allow everyone to make the necessary
transitions.
From our perspective, the implementation team should consist of agency leads and key staff that
carry out Vermont’s climate work. We envision a role for the following agencies and
departments, but others may need to be included as well:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Agency of Natural Resources (Chair)
Agency of Commerce and Community Development
Agency of Transportation
Agency of Agriculture
Department of Public Service
Department of Health
Department of Buildings and General Services
Department of Public Safety

The Vermont Climate Action Commission has consisted of 17 members of the public. The
membership has represented a wide range of stakeholders, but 17 is probably not appropriate
given the broader participation by State agencies and departments. Moving forward, if this
recommendation is accepted, we recommend the citizen advisory body be no more than 12
members.
The State agencies will be doing significant, regular implementation work, and we recommend
creating an effective process that balances that work with the time commitment of citizen
participants. We recommend monthly meetings of the interagency group with the citizen panel
being included quarterly or more regularly, as needed.

IV. Conclusion: Leadership and Investment
The members of the Vermont Climate Action Commission appreciate the leadership of the Scott
Administration in developing the charge of the Commission, re-affirming Vermont’s
Comprehensive Energy Plan and statutory climate goals and holding to Vermont’s share of the
global commitment to combat climate change affirmed in the Paris Accord. Gubernatorial
leadership will be crucial to realizing the transformational opportunity before us.
Climate action globally and in Vermont will require significant leadership and investment. The
magnitude of the climate challenge is unprecedented in human history. Answering climate
change, locally and globally, with appropriate, systematic and on-going action will be crucial to
the ecology of our state and the planet and the advance of human civilization.
Confronting these daunting challenges also offers virtually unprecedented economic opportunity.
Innovation in the economy, and leadership in public policy, can advance solutions to climate
change that are the right thing to do and that will be rewarded economically. Ongoing
commitment and meaningful and supportive policies, programs and partnerships will be
required. Places that lead in the development of business and policy solutions in the climate
economy will benefit by attracting youth, entrepreneurism and opportunities for renewed
prosperity. Vermont should be one of those places; a rural model of innovation and economic
renewal.
The recommendations in this report have been elaborated as starting points toward long-term
State of Vermont goals to reduce carbon and other greenhouse gas emissions, to meet our energy
needs with renewable sources, and ultimately, to contribute to an economy that advances
opportunities and affordability for all and lifts up and protects the most vulnerable Vermonters.
There will be costs entailed in the transformative nature of the changes needed – both costs to
Vermonters and Vermont businesses as well as costs in needed investment in policies,
incentives, and initiatives going forward.
The Governor’s Climate Action Commission considers many of those costs as an investment in
the energy system and economy of the future. We worked hard to minimize those costs and
recommend solutions that will lead to long-term affordability, economic growth, and savings for
all Vermonters. We encourage the Governor to evaluate opportunities to build sector
investments in weatherization, efficiency, wood heat, smart growth, sequestration, renewable
generation and vehicular electrification, and the other strategies entailed in this report as
priorities for your administration. We also encourage the Governor to examine and invest in
more robust economic analysis to inform policy decisions. Many of these investments will
generate economic returns and additional State taxes that will offset the initial cost.
Transformative change will require significant investment. Unfortunately, the current
marketplace does not produce a financial return and/or the upfront costs are unreachable for
many Vermonters for many steps necessary to meet the climate change goals. Our progress from
current incentives and citizens willing to go beyond the norm are not enough. Much more needs
to be done. We must change the economic drivers of climate change and tip the scales towards
the choices that will limit the devastating impacts of climate change.

- 84 -



This will require hard choices. We can reform and equalize our tax system to induce behavior
change, we can mandate change through statutory or regulatory action, we can let the market
efficiently allocate prices through a system like cap and invest or carbon pricing, or we can
accept that that we will not meet our goals through voluntary action in the current market where
the price of carbon is not properly accounted for in the costs of our goods and services.
We took what the Governor communicated to the Commission in his January 25, 2018, letter to
heart. There will be costs borne on Vermonters under any market-based carbon reduction
program. There will be new winners and losers. And there will be a need to help Vermonters
adjust to and afford energy costs today – and into the future. Our goal is to ensure that all
Vermonters have access to the cost savings we envision, are not disadvantaged relative to our
neighboring states and, instead, are economically stronger from Vermont’s forward-looking
commitment to reducing our significant reliance on imported fossil fuels. A national approach to
tackling this issue would level the playing field across the country, but under the current federal
administration, the prospects are dim. And opportunity exists with strategic approaches at a
smaller scale.
In light of those facts, we propose that the State of Vermont take a regional, national and
international leadership position on this important issue, building a coalition to create a system of
such breadth that Vermonters can benefit most and face the least consequences. One opportunity
exists with our primary international trading partner, Quebec, which has recently joined with
Ontario and California to create a cap and trade system. Additionally, all Canadian provinces by
the end of this year must select a carbon reduction strategy, whether by cap and trade or tax.
There is significant opportunity for Vermont to build momentum in partnership with other states
and provinces in a way that benefits us today – and far into the future. To reach a broad
spectrum system will take leadership, and we recommend that Vermont advocate for the creation
of as broad a program as possible to amplify the positive impacts and mitigate the negative
impacts Vermonters will face as we address the true cost of carbon.
In the interim, the Commission recommends that climate action be considered as a fundamental
priority of the administration for the use of limited general fund dollars. Tackling climate change
justifies raising new revenues over time. Bonding could also be beneficial where there are long
term returns, as in the potential case of low income weatherization where health and energy
savings impacts, improved affordability, and a rising quality of life for Vermont’s most
vulnerable families justify this form of structured investment. There may also be settlements
from power line or other infrastructure development that could contribute to climate action and
support these types of investments in an ongoing way.
As members of your Commission, we look to Vermont’s continued leadership to advance the
economy for the future while protecting the most vulnerable. The Governor provides a unifying
voice for all Vermonters to champion the direction forward, to speak for needed policies and
investments, to educate all Vermonters about climate change and its implications (including the
costs we are already paying today), to encourage household and collective action, and to seize
the economic opportunity for a healthy, secure and prosperous future for Vermont. The
Governor empowered us to recommend bold actions that will move Vermont forward. We have
tried to answer that call, and we look forward to continuing to support your leadership on these
issues and to working more broadly with Vermonters to refine and implement these and other
strategies that will position Vermont as a leader and innovator on job-creating climate action.

Appendix B: Vermont Climate Action Commission Charge,
Membership, and Process
To continue Vermont’s efforts to combat climate change and meet the State’s renewable energy
goals, Governor Scott created the Vermont Climate Action Commission, a 21-member body,
through Executive Order 12-17 (EO 12-17) to provide tangible and meaningful
recommendations to move Vermont forward to meeting the aggressive climate change goals of
our State.
In developing solutions to advance Vermont’s climate change mitigation efforts, EO 12-17
charges the Commission with the following guiding principles:
1. solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions must spur economic activity, inspire

and grow Vermont businesses, and put Vermonters on a path to affordability;
2. the development of solutions must engage all Vermonters, so no individual or

The Commission met for the first time on August 15, 2017. In September and October 2017,
the Commission held four public meetings. The Commission held those meetings in
geographically diverse locations, providing access to a public scoping session within a
reasonable drive for all Vermonters. The meetings were held in the following locations on the
following dates:
•
•
•
•

St. Johnsbury, September 14, 2017
Manchester, September 21, 2017
St. Albans, September 28, 2017
Brattleboro, October 5, 2017

In addition to providing the public the opportunity to raise recommendations to the Commission
through the scoping sessions, the Commission has maintained a website and email address to
facilitate additional public input. All of the ideas gathered have been regularly added to a list
and posted online. Additionally, a complete archive of the email and web form submissions has
been regularly updated and added to the website: http://anr.vermont.gov/about_us/specialtopics/vermont-climate-action- commission.
Response to the Governor’s Request for Three Actional Recommendations
The Commission spent the fall focused on the request of Governor Scott to provide at least three
actionable recommendations by January 1, 2018. To accomplish that task, the Commission

- 93 -



formed eight subcommittees. The subcommittees consisted of four sector-specific and four
cross-cutting groups. The subcommittees and their members are as follows:
Sector-specific subcommittees:
Power Production, Distribution, and Use – Bill Laberge, Johanna Miller, Mary
Sprayregen, June Tierney, Kristin Carlson, and Adam Knudsen
Commercial and Residential Buildings – Peter Bourne, Bob Stevens, Liz Gamache,
Stu Hart, and Mike Schirling
Transportation – Joe Fusco, Michele Boomhower, Bethany Fleishman, Linda
McGinnis, and Harrison Bushnell
Agriculture/Forestry/Waste/Industry – Paul Costello, Marie Audet, Robert
Turner, Tom Donahue, and Peter Walke
Cross-cutting subcommittees:
Access to Capital – Bob Stevens, Robert Turner, Kristin Carlson, June Tierney, and
Mike Schirling
Education, Communication, and Outreach – Johanna Miller, Liz Gamache,
Harrison Bushnell, Michele Boomhower, Marie Audet, and Tom Donahue
Rural Solutions – Peter Bourne, Bill Laberge, Mary Sprayregen, Bethany
Fleishman, and Peter Walke
Research and Development / Non-emissions-based climate actions – Joe Fusco, Stu
Hart, Linda McGinnis, Paul Costello, and Adam Knudsen
All subcommittee meetings were listed on the Commission’s webpage and announced with the
Department of Libraries to ensure the public had the opportunity to participate. The
subcommittees developed their priority recommendations, and the Commission voted on them
for inclusion in the report to the Governor. The Commission’s preliminary recommendations
and the Governor’s response can be found at the Commission’s website:
http://anr.vermont.gov/about_us/special-topics/vermont-climate-action- commission.
Work to Develop This Report
Following submission of that report, at the January 11, 2018 Commission meeting, the
Commissioners undertook a prioritization exercise to determine where to focus its remaining
efforts on actions the group believed would create the most leverage for change in reducing
greenhouse gas emissions or sequestering greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. These six
topics were selected not because they represented all arenas in which climate action will be
necessary to meet our goals, but rather those sectors where significant untapped potential exists
for systemic change. In addition to these areas of consensus-based focus, the Commission
recognizes that other policies and solutions will merit further consideration and pursuit by the
Governor, policy makers and all Vermonters to continue to chart the path for the progress we
need.
During the January 2018 meeting, the Commission agreed to focus on six priority areas:

- 94 -



•
•
•
•
•
•

vehicle electrification
building energy use
electric grid modernization
land use as an enabler
the climate economy
carbon sequestration

At the February 8, 2018 meeting, the Commission developed a full day of expert panels on
those six topics to better understand what the current state and options for progress were for
each topic. Following the panel presentations and discussion with the experts, the Commission
determined to move forward with all but the grid modernization. The Commission determined
that the grid modernization effort undertaken by the Public Utility Commission, the Public
Service Department, and the distributions utilities was sufficient and that the Commission
would not add significant value to that discussion. That does not reflect that the Commission is
not interested in the success of grid modernization, more that we believe it will occur without
our intervention. In fact, the Commission is supportive of increasing Vermont-based grid
modernization businesses.
Working groups were developed for those five topics. Each working group has outlined below
their efforts to outline a set of recommendations in each of the five focal areas to catalyze
progress in these important sectors. It is important to note, however, that there are several
important areas where the Commission chose not to focus; not because further action isn’t
necessary in those areas – like the strategic deployment of distributed generation – but, instead,
that the Commission found it important to highlight a smaller set of actionable items to focus
and spur state leadership and action in these sectors specifically.
In the intervening months, the Commission chose to expand upon vehicle electrification to
include all needed action in the transportation space. Additionally, the Commission determined
that smart growth was the more appropriate focus for the land use discussion. The processes
undertaken by each working group is outlined below, but all working groups included outside
expertise in order to broaden the perspective about action needed to address climate change.
During the spring, the working groups began briefings for the full Commission on the focus of
their recommendations. The recommendations evolved during that time in response to
feedback. At the May 10, 2018 meeting, the Commission asked two small groups to explore an
appropriate format and presentation style for the report and to explore the issue of funding.
This report incorporates the recommendations of those two groups in substance and style.
At the July 12, 2018 meeting, the Commission voted to approve the recommendations included
herein. Appendix E includes how Commissioners voted. Additionally, at the final July
meeting, the Commission asked a small group to provide greater scrutiny and standardization to
the greenhouse gas impacts presented. Additionally, the Commission requested that a small
group standardize the GHG impact measure for each recommendation or group of
recommendations.

Transportation Working Group Process
The Transportation Working Group initially concentrated on recommendations to electrify the
statewide transportation fleet as quickly as possible. As its work continued, the Working Group
also developed a number of recommendations relating to transportation demand management
(TDM). Vehicle electrification and TDM, working together, are critical strategies for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from Vermont’s transportation sector, while strengthening the
economy and improving the quality of life across the breadth of transportation system users.
Other strategies, like land use and transportation planning, are also important. However, the
Transportation Working Group mostly deferred to the Smart Growth Working Group in this
area and to the ongoing planning work of state agencies, regional planning commissions, and
municipalities.
The Transportation Working Group’s vehicle electrification and TDM recommendations take
broad-based approaches. For example, the vehicle electrification recommendations extend to
reducing EV costs, creating a regulatory environment that encourages utility and private-sector
buildout of charging infrastructure, redesigning utility rates to lower the costs of EV charging
without burdening ratepayers, harnessing VW settlement funds to advance the electrification of
buses, and increasing education and outreach to help dealers sell and consumers buy EVs. The
TDM recommendations will help move the transportation sector away from single occupancy
vehicles to less energy demanding, multi-modal alternatives, including public transit, ride
sharing, walking, and biking.
The Transportation Working Group, including commissioners and support staff, met between
Commission meetings to develop and evaluate recommendations. One or two volunteers from
the Working Group then took the lead on drafting (and redrafting) recommendations. The
Working Group provided input on these drafts through email exchanges or additional in-person
meetings. Working Group meetings were democratic, with staff and Commissioners actively
participating. The transportation recommendations are the result of the considerable expertise
of the Commission members and support staff who served on the Working Group, with
occasional input from outside experts, including for example, Marilyn Miller, Executive
Director of the Vermont Vehicle and Automotive Distributors Association.
Linda McGinnis, Michele Boomhower, and Harrison Bushnell were lead drafters of the
Workgroup’s initial recommendations that the Commission sent to the Governor in December
2017. Jennifer Wallace-Brodeur and Johanna Miller took the lead on reworking those
recommendations to produce a draft of the most recent version of the Workplan, with Bethany
Fleishman taking a lead role in providing a list of ideas on TDM, which the Workgroup revised
for inclusion in its final report. Commissioners or delegates and agency support staff who were
most active on the Transportation Working Group include the following:
Commissioners:
Riley Allen (Department of Public Service)
Michele Boomhower (Agency of Transportation)
Harrison Bushnell (U-32 High School Senior)

Building Energy Working Group Process
The Building Energy Workgroup was comprised of Riley Allen, Kristen Carlson, Paul Costello,
Matt Cota, Tom Donahue, Linda McGinnis, Bob Stevens, and Jennifer Wallace-Brodeur. State
agency staff that assisted the group included Danial Edson, Josh Kelly, Kelly Launder, and Jared
Ulmer. Special thanks to Kelly for organizing meetings and keeping notes, in addition to the
technical assistance. The Building Energy Workgroup also greatly benefited from the additional
technical assistance of Emma Hanson, Paul Frederick, Andy Perchlik, Adam Sherman, and Dave
Westman.
Smart Growth Working Group Process
The Smart Growth Working Group formed following the February 8th Commission meeting. At
the working group’s recommendation, the working group changed its focus from overall and
use to smart growth.
Smart Growth has a long history in Vermont, and the working group endeavored to reflect the
significant efforts that have gone into Vermont’s statewide, regional, and local planning efforts
to advance the adoption and implementation of smart growth principles. Despite those efforts,
the progress toward realizing smart growth has been inconsistent.
Therefore, the working group made the determination early on to focus on recommendations
that would lead to the implementation of smart growth principles in Vermont communities. The
working group discussed the barriers to achieve the vision that many communities have
established for themselves and looked for ways to overcome those obstacles. The

- 97 -



recommendations intentionally do not include adding to or altering existing planning
requirements as we have received the feedback that communities have planning fatigue.
The Commission members on the working group received significant input and support from
State agency staff and other stakeholders. The Commission members would like to thank the
following individuals for supporting the work: Kevin Geiger (Two Rivers-Ottauquechee
Regional Commission), Charlie Baker (Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission),
Jamey Fidel (Vermont Natural Resources Council), Kate McCarthy (Vermont Natural
Resources Council), Billy Coster (ANR), Jen Mojo (ANR), Chris Cochran (ACCD), Jacob
Hemmerick (ACCD), Gary Holloway (ACCD), Dan Dutcher (VTrans), Tami Wuestenberg
(DEC), John Austin (F&W), Tom Rogers (F&W), Jens Hilke (F&W), and Jared Ulmer (VDH).
Sequestration Working Group
The sequestration workgroup examined the opportunities for carbon sequestration in agriculture
and forest land, focusing largely on the considerable knowledge available within the state. UVM
Extension and UVM professors were particularly knowledgeable and generous with their
expertise. They provided perspective, both scientific and practical, and data. For the February 8,
2018 Commission meeting, UVM Extension (Jeff Carter) presented a synopsis of carbon
sequestration in agricultural soils, while Commissioner Robert Turner covered sequestration in
forestry. As the Commission continued its work, Agency staff provided key support for program
information, practical experience with farmers and forest landowners, and generally filled a huge
gap in the committee’s capacity.
The workgroup developed a plan in January, and generally followed that plan (available on the
Commission web site), filling in pieces related to the science (soil chemistry and agronomy), the
economics, rates and methods of adoption, and the potential for carbon payments. Over the
course of five Commission meetings and three conference calls, the workgroup digested the
information refined the products of its efforts. The workgroup focused on sequestration of carbon
through basic land management practices and policies and explored emerging opportunities in
the areas of biochar, engineered wood for commercial buildings, and bio-energy product from
biomass (see appended).

Biochar
Engineered wood for construction
Various emerging technologies that convert woody biomass into fossil fuel substitutes.

These items were explored to the extent that we felt they were relevant. Biochar is a product that
can be made from various biomass products including low-quality trees. Using biochar as a soil
amendment, its proponents argue it sequesters carbon and improves soil fertility. While these
claims are largely substantiated, the costs of creating biochar products and the economics of its

- 99 -



application to soil do not currently favor widespread use. As with other practices that sequester
carbon in soils, protocols have either not been established or offset markets are thin.
Engineered wood products (mass timber, cross-laminated timber and similar products) are
changing the way that wood is used in commercial construction. Technological advances have
demonstrated that even 12-story buildings can now be built with wood framing, avoiding the
high embedded-energy alternatives like steel and concrete. Carbon sequestered for long periods
in the building and the emissions associated with the manufacture of the building systems are
substantially reduced. Maine is pursuing a manufacturing plant that would use its softwood
resource, but there are few manufacturers of engineered wood products in the Northeast, and the
price is unlikely to be competitive. Still, this technology should be monitored closely. It is likely
the products will be competitive soon.
In other regions of the country other products are made from woody biomass. These products
include transportation fuel (biodiesel and jet fuel), renewable natural gas (RNG), and plastic
substitutes. Many of these processes are being proven at demonstration scale but are not yet at
commercial scale. Using emerging technologies, it seems possible that some of our Vermont
biomass and some of these products will end up in the playing a role in GHG reductions in the
17-year time frame we have been considering.
Climate Economy Working Group Process
From the outset, the work group focused on two questions:
•
•

What are the businesses to support?
What are the public policy mechanisms that provide the most support?

The work group identified a wide range of businesses that fell into one or more of the following
sectors:
•
•
•

Energy efficiency goods and services
Renewable generation
Energy services delivery (such as electric utilities and wood fuel suppliers)

The choice among businesses identified was based on three factors
•
•
•

The existence of the business sector in Vermont
The opportunities for growth
The impacts those companies make and could make in the future on the State’s climate
change strategies.

In parallel with discussions about the businesses on which to focus, the group also considered
what strategy-types the Commission could recommend that would provide benefits for their
growth. A starting point in this discussion was a list of existing programs that are used as
support for all types of businesses in Vermont and are often hosted at the State’s Department of
Economic Development. More detailed project ideas evolved when considering the individual
business types that arose during the identification of businesses as described above.
As the text notes, several other work groups developed incentives and programs that strengthen
the consumer contributions to business growth (while it may not have been an explicit work
- 100 -



group decision, the result is that we decided to focus on producer assistance by cost reduction
and improved access to human and dollar capital.)
A work group voting process resulted in the identification of Clean Grid Modernization and
Wood pellet manufacturing as the targets for business support activities. The work group then
refined the resulting list of incentives and strategies to the two businesses.

Appendix C: Additional Information
1. Double low-income weatherization through the State Weatherization Assistance
Program
The Vermont low-income weatherization program has the experience and capacity to work with
Community Action Agencies and weatherization partners to implement grants to dramatically
expand low-income weatherization today. The challenge has been and continues to be funding.
An increase in low-income weatherization investments made today will reduce fuel needs for the
most vulnerable Vermonters, lower their energy costs, make their homes healthier, and reduce
carbon emissions, thereby providing significant economic returns on up front investments.
Evidence from other jurisdictions, suggest that the health-related benefits alone are several times
that of the investments. One recent study estimated the value of the average health-related
benefits at 3.5 times greater than the average project cost. Weatherization projects often result in
improved indoor air quality and mitigation of improperly ventilated appliances, electrical and
fire hazards, and other critical health and safety hazards. As resources allow, weatherization
providers can also help mitigate trip and fall hazards, mold and moisture issues, lead paint
hazards, and pest issues. This recommendation would meet the long waiting lists for low-income
home weatherization that exist today even without outreach by the agencies, and dramatically
advance affordability and protect the most vulnerable Vermonters, including children in poverty
and seniors living in inadequately weatherized homes.
Weatherizing 900 additional homes implies a reduction of approximately 1.62 MtCO2e annually,
or roughly 9.9 MtCO2e annually by 2025, and add roughly $10 million annually to the cost of
the existing programs. The average savings per household is about $500 annually. Since the
proposal represents an expansion of existing programs and activities of existing institutions, the
expansion at this level can be accomplished with relative ease. Since the programs address the
some of the most vulnerable segments of the market, additional benefits include less stress on
other support systems supported by taxpayers, and improvements to the health and well-being of
the affective households.
2. Accelerate the adoption of Advanced Wood Heat (AWH) to replace high-GHG emitting
systems to reach 30 percent of Vermont thermal needs by 2025 (triple installations)
In conjunction with sustainable forestry practices, AWH helps to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, reduce heating bills, improve air quality, develop local economy, and create new jobs
through the forest products value chain, thereby helping sustain and manage the state’s extensive
forest resources. The tripling of AWH installations is approximately equivalent to a 0.3 (million
tons of CO2 equivalent) MMTCO2e annually. This calculation assumes the following:
•
•
•
•
•

18,000 more residential pellet stoves (from the current 31,000)
5,100 more automated pellet boilers (from the current 377) ($19,000)
1,260 more commercial/institutional bulk pellet systems (from the current 162)
108 more commercial woodchip systems (from the current 61)
At least 4 new small pellet mills to ensure the increased demand is met from locally
produced pellets

- 102 -



Total investment assumes roughly $223 million of incremental investment ($356 million total),
with roughly a third of the investment covered through incentives. Annual fuel savings are
potentially substantial but can vary with assumed oil prices and the price of wood energy. Given
the uncertainties in these values it is difficult to attribute large savings, but savings are expected
to cover the incremental costs of the investments the period of roughly a decade at current price
levels.
The carbon reduction potential is likely in excess of 0.3 MMtCO2e annually by 2025, depending
on the composition of fuels displaced and whether the wood is from sustainable sources.
The benefits of a locally driven AWH market extend into the local economy as well. With the
closure of pulp and paper mills in the northeast, the market for low-grade wood has really
suffered. Being able to find markets for all timber is critically important to sustainable forestry
in Vermont. Further, it also supports landowners retaining large forest blocks because it
increases the value to the landowner. Locally produced chips and pellets can help fill some of
the void left behind and support forest landowners.
Vermont’s forest economy is an integral part of a regional and international market, in which
product prices fluctuate with supply and demand beyond our borders. Eighty‑nine percent of the
sawlog volume harvested annually in Vermont is processed within the state, and this value‑added
local rural economy is essential for many communities and landowners. But wood moves freely
through our larger, regional economy, and northern hardwoods — maple, beech, yellow birch,
and more — are prized and sought after throughout the world. Exports of sawlogs from
Vermont exceed imports, but only slightly, by a 1.3 to 1 ratio.
Primary products include solid wood products from sawmills and veneer mills. These primary
manufacturers employ 2,327 workers. Payroll in the wood products sector is about $67 million
annually. Current annual economic output, in terms of annual sales or value of shipments, stands
at $239 million.
Secondary manufacturers transform lumber and other primary solid products into finished
consumer products or components for finished products. The making of furniture, moldings,
turnings, and similar products employs nearly 1,600 Vermont workers. The annual payroll in this
sector is about $49 million.
Annual economic output, in the form of sales or value of shipments for the secondary wood
products sector, is about $143 million in Vermont.
3. Accelerate building electrification (Install 60,000 space and water heat pumps by 2025)
Recommendations to encourage the technology include customer education, ratepayer
incentives, rate design, and aggregation of shared access. Most of these recommendations are
within the ability of the distribution utility to implement. The obligations and the form of
regulation should be aligned with customer interests. The life cycle costs of these measures
should not drive up overall costs of energy services for customers. The costs of these new loads
should be low, even for the electric system, as these could constitute new loads, adding new
margin, and offer the potential to add new services that can help integrate growth in distributed
generation.

- 103 -



The better your building shell, the more cost-effective and efficient will be the heat pumps used
in the technology. Heat pumps technology should be coupled with improvements to the building
shell (weatherization).
The carbon reduction potential by 2025 is roughly 0.183 MMtCO2e. The investment required to
install an additional 60,000 heat pumps (water and space) is substantial. The installed cost of a
heat pump is roughly $2500. The installed costs of a heat pump water heater is approximately
$2000 per water heater. Assuming an average cost of $2,250, the total cost of investment would
be $135 million over a period of 6 years. Annual fuel savings would be roughly $54 million
annually (for all 60,000). The technology is now relatively mature and an installation network is
now widespread with trained and certified installers. Additional incentives provided through rate
design or upfront payments would be relatively easy given the years of experience that utilities,
including Efficiency Vermont, have with these programs.
4. Adopt and implement a roadmap for all new buildings to be net zero by 2030
This recommendation would take very little investment to implement. The PSD has already
budgeted federal funds to develop the road map. Remaining investments would be by the
building owner/developer when constructing these buildings, which would largely be offset by
lower operational costs for the building. These buildings would also have less exposure to
volatile fuel prices. This provides for long-term affordability.
The State has already made progress in this direction having adopted standards to meet high
energy efficiency performance in new State-owned buildings and moving away from fossil fuel
heating. Several other states have also developed or are developing goals for net-zero designed
homes.
For purposes of the calculated emissions, savings and investments, calculations assumed that
investment resulted from efficiency improvements of 10 percent per update over two update
cycles and that the investment required could be achieved at a return of 8 years or better, as has
been achieved in past updates. Roughly 10 MtCO2e reduction is achieved by 2025 with annual
energy savings of roughly $3 million annually. Total investment required to achieve these
savings are roughly $24 million.
5. Increase building energy labeling in Vermont to make building energy use more visible
A residential building energy label, called the Vermont Home Energy Profile (VHEP), has
already been developed. The VHEP includes an asset‑based total MMBtu/year projected energy
consumption score; projected energy costs by fuel type; and a general description of the home.
An asset‑based score was chosen to allow for consistent comparisons, regardless of who had
previously lived in the house and how they had operated it. Projected energy costs were chosen,
as that is a measure that homeowners can easily understand.
Commercial buildings can be benchmarked with EPA’s free ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager
(ESPM) tool, which utilizes operational energy consumption data, with energy use intensity
(EUI, measured in kBtu/square foot/year) as the primary metric. ESPM can also generate a
building energy label.

- 104 -



One purpose of labeling is to allow the comparison of similar buildings and eventually the
valuing of energy improvements in appraisals. For this to happen a volume of labels would need
to be generated to have enough for comparison. To date approximately 300 Home Energy
Profiles have been generated. The data needed to generate a label is also collected during energy
assessments performed through the Energy Efficiency Utility weatherization programs and the
State’s low-income Home Weatherization Assistance Program, but labels aren’t typically
generated through these programs. Approximately, 2,000 housing units are served through these
programs annually. The necessary data is also collected when buildings are being constructed
for the Building Energy Standards certificates. Approximately 1,000 homes and 200 commercial
buildings are constructed annually.
Tracking energy usage in buildings is an important first step toward reducing energy
consumption and associated costs. Benchmarking helps building owners and managers make
informed decisions about energy investments, especially in the public and commercial sectors
where facilities managers can control large amounts of energy usage.
On average, buildings which are consistently benchmarked reduce their energy consumption by
approximately 2.4 percent each year (Source: EPA). According to a survey of facility managers,
those that benchmark their properties are more likely to make energy efficiency improvements
than those that don’t benchmark. Research suggests that buildings which undergo the
benchmarking process and achieve an energy efficient certification—such as ENERGY STAR—
are valued accordingly by the market and obtain higher rents, sale values, occupancy rates,
productivity rates, and operational savings. Building energy usage disclosure ordinances have
unquestionably spurred the creation of building construction and energy service job in
municipalities where these ordinances are already in effect. Money invested in energy efficiency
stays within the local economy, rather than flowing out of state for oil and gas extraction and
refining (www.neep.org).
This recommendation would require little to no additional investment as the data required for the
labels will be gathered through the normal course of business by the existing efficiency programs
or builders/architects (in the case of new construction).
If Vermont were to enact a benchmarking ordinance for commercial buildings, the level of
investment would be spread across stakeholders in the form of staff time and commitment.
Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP) has provided a case study on the recent
benchmarking ordinance in South Portland, Maine that provides an overview of what this might
entail. (www.neep.org)
6. Increase low-to-moderate income homes weatherized through the Energy Efficiency
Utility programs
Although the State Weatherization Assistance Program can serve low-income households up to
80 percent of median income, households up to 60 percent of median income are prioritized
leaving most households between 60-80 percent of median income unserved. Additionally, there
are not services or incentives targeted to the 80-120 percent low/moderate income households.
This gap of vulnerable Vermonters who need significant assistance to complete weatherization
projects is the challenge we hope to address. Tiered incentives can be used to buy down the cost

- 105 -



of loans. This recommendation would target increased resources to this population to help fill
the gap of service to this population by reallocation of existing energy efficiency program
resources and direct recently approved State Treasurer funds for low-interest loans to serve this
population.
The program costs assume that $5 million annually of public funds can be raised at the public
cost of capital of about 2.5 percent. The practical effect of the use of public funds is to double
the number of low to moderate income households that gain access to low cost capital, due to the
cheaper cost of public versus private capitals. The State funds, however, are fully repaid. Over
5 years $25 million in State funds would leverage an additional $25 million in private capital to
double the level of deep retrofits. Approximately 8 MtCO2e could be achieved annually from
2025 (assuming 5 years of investment) reaching an additional 922 homes annually. Total
savings per household would be approximately $522 for total annual savings of $2.4 million.
Once funds are committed, the program amounts to an expansion of existing programs and can
be achieved with relative ease.
7. Expand Vermont’s State Energy Management Program to serve municipalities,
universities, schools and hospitals.
Larger institutional energy users are a good fit for investment by Energy Service Companies
(“ESCOs”) through energy performance contracting (“EPC”). The characteristics of MUSH
institutions include relative stability of their services and energy requirements, long investment
horizons, and low cost of capital. The ESCO industry is an estimated $7 billion market in the US
that has reliably partnered to provide $55 billion of guaranteed and verified savings since 1990.
About 80-85 percent of the industry is focused on MUSH and federal customers.
A key concern in Vermont associated with Energy Performance Contracting through ESCOs is
their requirement for relatively higher cost projects with higher rates of return. To achieve
Vermont’s significant energy conservation and greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals within
the MUSH sector, deeper energy retrofits that encompass as many energy saving opportunities
within a building as possible are necessary.
Many states have created government bodies to facilitate the implementation of performance
contracting and Vermont can learn from their successes while adapting the innovations to the
performance contracting model employed within the SEMP leading to lower project costs and
deeper energy savings.
8-17. Additional information related to light duty vehicle electrification and charging
infrastructure
EVs can reduce household transportation costs, particularly for rural residents who must travel
long distances for jobs and services. If strategically deployed, EVs can also help utilities manage
peak demand and better integrate renewable energy sources, saving money for all ratepayers. To
realize these benefits, public programs and policies can help overcome the primary barriers to
EV adoption—the upfront cost of the vehicle, lack of public awareness of EVs, lack of
availability of EV models, and lack of availability of public charging—while ensuring equity and
affordability for all Vermonters.

- 106 -



Accelerating the adoption of EVs is one of the fastest ways to reduce our greenhouse gas in the
next 8 years (EAN Top 10 Driver’s to Vermont’s 2025 Milestones, Figure 3 on Page 5).
Additionally, EVs are also one of the fastest ways to reduce annual household energy
expenditures. The average Vermont household spends over half its monthly energy dollars on
transportation, with nearly 80 percent of that money going out of state for fossil fuels. EVs are at
least three times more efficient than gas-powered vehicles. They can convert about 70 percent of
the energy supplied from the grid to power the wheels. Typical gas vehicles are only about 20
percent efficient from the fuel tank to the wheels.
With an expectation that EVs will eventually become more affordable than combustion cars, it is
important to focus on expanding outreach to low-middle income and rural Vermonters now, as
they may have the most to gain from the change.
By providing the policy framework that accelerates EV adoption for all Vermonters, we can
dramatically reduce our emissions to meet our Paris goals while ensuring that low and middleincome Vermonters can benefit from the savings that this shift brings. Most importantly, we
have available funding to jumpstart this transition: the VW settlement funds. (Note: up to 15
percent of the $18.7M of funds coming to Vermont under Appendix D of the VW settlement can
be dedicated to electric vehicle charging infrastructure for passenger vehicles. These funds are
not available for consumer incentives.)

- 107 -



Charging Stations: There are around 160 public charging stations currently in Vermont (see
DEV Map of EV Charging Stations in Vermont), but:
● If we project increasing from 2,500 to 45,000-55,000 EVs by 2025, we need to ensure
sufficient charging infrastructure to meet the demand
● Public charging stations do not reach all parts of Vermont, and many regions are left
without any access to public charging stations at all
● Very few public charging stations are fast-charging; the state lacks an adequate charging
network for through travelers
● Very few charging stations are located at places of work (businesses, schools, etc.),
where they could assist greater numbers of people who could benefit from all-day
charging. (Daytime charging also helps take advantage of solar photovoltaic energy
sources.)
Transportation Spending: Vermonters collectively spent over $1 billion on transportation
energy in 2015. Driving on electricity could cut this cost by 65 percent to about $350 million,
with more of the electricity dollars staying local to Vermont.
Auto Ownership/Geographic Energy Burden: Auto ownership is high in Vermont. While it is
essential to invest in public transportation and other options to reduce single occupancy driving,
we also need to recognize that these options are challenging to deploy in rural areas. (See map of

- 108 -



Transportation Hot Spots.) Most Vermonters will continue to use personal vehicles to meet their
mobility and access needs for the foreseeable future.

EV Costs and Savings: New EVs currently cost more upfront than comparable gasoline
vehicles, but EVs provide lifecycle savings by cutting energy and maintenance costs in half or
more. Over the next 10 years the price difference is expected to shrink as EV technology
achieves greater economies of scale. More pre-owned EVs are coming onto the market and
provide even greater opportunities for affordable, low-carbon transportation.
Health Benefits: The American Lung Association estimates Vermont experienced $347M in
health and climate related costs in 2015 due to fossil fueled transportation. Shifting to EVs could
reduce this by more than 90 percent. EVs also reduce other harmful and toxic tailpipe emissions,
leading directly to added health and environmental benefits beyond greenhouse gas emissions.
Incentives: Several electric utilities are already providing incentives to complement federal tax
subsidies for EVs through Tier III of Vermont’s Renewable Energy Standard (and some car
companies, such as Nissan, are providing their own). However, these are insufficient to meet the
needed growth in EV adoption, they vary widely among utility territories, they frequently do not
apply to the used car market, and they are not systematically targeted to low/middle-income
Vermonters.
Awareness: Drive Electric Vermont (supported by VTrans, PSD, and ANR) is promoting
outreach and education on EVs with the funding available. Accelerating the adoption of EVs at
the pace necessary to achieve our goals will require additional resources and effort to reach
consumers in more rural areas and to engage dealers.

- 109 -



Rate structures: Residential customers in the state typically face a uniform per kWh charge that
applies during all periods of the day and is undifferentiated by time of day or conditions on the
grid. Thus, homeowners have no incentive to charge their EV’s when it is most beneficial to the
grid. In some service territories, there is an initial low-cost rate block that applies to the first 100
or 200 kWhs and then increases at a higher tail block that rises to as much as 17 and 23
cents/kWh. More typically, residential consumers in the state pay about 15 cents/kWh. Yet the
underlying forward-looking costs of EV charging range from 3 to 8 cents/kWh, depending on the
period in which vehicles are charged. Controlled charging off-peak can cost as little as 3 to 4
cents/kWh to the utility system. Rate designs can send a strong conservation signal in an era in
which we need to grow demand for well-managed EV loads. Current rate designs provide little
incentive to manage customer loads for system benefits and likely undermines customer
economics for greater EV adoption and ambitions to move from high-carbon fuel demands to
low-carbon electricity. Under present conditions, there is little incentive for commercial and
industrial customers to invest in charging stations due to rate designs and demand charges that
may represent an economic barrier. The rate designs available through our utilities likely do not
reflect the opportunities to help accelerate the construction of public charging stations generally,
and the customer and utility economics of well-managed charging.
Funding Sources:
• Charging Infrastructure: VW settlement funds (15 percent for light duty vehicle
charging), and possible Tier III or other utility funds.
• EV Incentives: there is a need to understand the pros and cons of a range of potential
funding sources that would not affect the State general fund or the transportation fund
revenue. These include, among others, expanding the Tier III requirements of the
State’s Renewable Energy Standard.
11-12 Additional Information Related to Heavy Duty Vehicle Electrification
Gasoline and diesel represent more than 35 percent of all energy consumed in our state.
Switching from low-mileage, high-emitting buses to electric ones will help us meet our climate
goals by reducing greenhouse gas and overall energy consumed and increasing the portion of
renewably powered transportation. Additionally, by providing more public transportation
options to rural Vermonters, we can reduce overall Single Occupancy Vehicle (SOV) use,
thereby further reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Currently there are over 400 electric buses already in operation in the US. The most recent test
in Sept 2017 of public transit buses in California show that the ranges now extend over 1000
miles on a single charge, although most current transit buses on the market average 350 miles.
Additionally, there are examples of successful transit bus electrification projects such as in the
City of Greensboro, NC. Greensboro is pairing voter approved funding with a grant from Duke
Energy to purchase electric buses and expects to save (from O&M) $1.7M over the 12-year
lifetime of the first 4 buses purchased.
Electric transit buses cost about $200,000 more to buy than nearly identical diesel models
($660,000 for a 35-ft electric bus, compared with $450,000 for diesel), but those costs are
recoverable through the vehicle’s lifespan, according to detailed studies by Vermont-based
- 110 -



Green Mountain Transit. If diesel costs $2.40/gallon, an electric bus would save $44,000 over its
12-year life compared with an equivalent diesel-powered bus, considering all costs and savings,
including decreased fuel and maintenance expenses and the increased upfront cost of the electric
bus.
Finally, there are many environmental, social, health, and educational benefits associated with
switching from diesel buses to electric buses. The emission reductions associated with electric
buses vary by model, but to give an example, switching one large diesel transit bus to an electric
bus can lead to annual savings of over 50 tons of greenhouse gas, 445 metric tons of CO2, nearly
300 lbs of CO, and 628 lbs of NOx. Multiplied over the estimated 12-year lifespan of a bus, and
multiple buses across a fleet, Vermont stands to gain real environmental benefits and make
progress toward its climate and energy goals from bus electrification. Communities that have
electric buses, whether transit or school buses, will also help reduce the very real impacts of
diesel on people’s health. According to the Clean Air Task Force’s study, the cost of health
impacts in Vermont from fine diesel particles was $29M in 2005. The lack of tail pipe emissions
also provides significant health benefits, especially to children who ride buses twice a day, five
days a week, and they generate far less noise than diesel buses.
Public Transit Buses: Currently in Vermont, there are a total of 425 public transit vehicles, of
which approximately 90 are set to be replaced due to age and condition (value of appx $12M, in
capital budgets). These vehicles range from smaller vans to larger buses, and their lifespans
range from 7-15 years, depending on the type and size.
Burlington has already bought four electric buses in partnership with Burlington Electric, VEIC,
VTrans, and Green Mountain Transit (and a grant from the U.S. Department. of Transportation).
The result of this is that some of Burlington’s most vulnerable people will have cleaner air to
breathe through diesel emissions reductions, Green Mountain Transit will enjoy lower operating
and maintenance costs associated with all EVs, and Burlington will reduce its greenhouse gas
emissions to zero for these buses. Most of Green Mountain Transit’s buses travel around 30,000
miles each year, consuming 7,000 gallons of diesel and emitting 77 tons of carbon. About 15 of
the diesel buses in GMT’s fleet have been in service for more than 14 years or 370,000 miles.
GMT officials say that these buses are considered near the end of their useful lives and in need of
replacement.
School Buses: There are 250 public schools in Vermont, including 28 union high schools,
attesting to the full reach of school buses to all regions of Vermont. School buses fall within
Type I (more than 15 passengers) and Type II (between 10 and 16 passengers). School buses are
generally utilized only during the morning and afternoon hours when children are going to and
from school. For the remainder of the day, they are generally not in service, leaving electric
school buses potentially useful as an electricity storage resource as vehicle to grid technology
matures.
Renewable Energy vs. Efficient Diesel: Achieving this goal assumes that electric buses are
powered with renewable energy. Currently, approximately 55 percent of Vermont’s electricity is
considered renewable, with utilities required by the Renewable Energy Standard to increase the
percent of renewable electricity in their portfolio annually until 75 percent is achieved in 2032.

- 111 -



In some jurisdictions, the percentage or renewable sources is far higher: for example, both the
Burlington Electric Department and Washington Electric Co-op have portfolios that are already
100 percent renewable, while GMP’s portfolio is forecasted to be 60 percent renewable energy
by the end of next year.
Funding: The VW Settlement funds are intended to be used to reduce diesel emissions. Rather
than utilize this once-in-a-decade source of funding to transition heavy-duty vehicles to more
efficient diesel engines, this could be the moment to catalyze a permanent shift away from NOx
tailpipe emissions and to zero emissions for the lifetime of the vehicle. It is essential that any
decisions around spend these funds consider the lifespan costs of the vehicle, including
operations and maintenance costs, as well as pollutants and carbon costs. Whereas “efficient
diesel” vehicles are less expensive to purchase, they are much more expensive to maintain with
regular diesel, oil, transmission fluid, emissions systems repairs, etc., and they will continue to
emit pollutants and carbon (albeit at a reduced level) for their lifetimes. Given the long lifespan
of most heavy-duty vehicles (average 12 years), it is critical to utilize VW funds in a way that
generates years of the lowest possible emissions. Any economic analysis must compare the net
present values of the costs of these vehicles over time, including the externalities (positive and
negative) generated by continued fossil fuel use over the life of the vehicles.
Grid Constraints: Because of the growing amount of renewable generation on Vermont’s
electric grid, there are times and places where we produce more than we use (during high
wind/sun periods), and other times when we use more than we produce. In particular, the grid
faces increasing constraints in the Sheffield-Highgate region in Northern Vermont. Generation
resources inside this area are limited in real time to ensure that the system capacity is not
exceeded in the event of a potential future transmission outage. The practical effect of this is
that, from time to time, generation resources in this area are required to curtail their output due to
the lack of capacity to export power, and many Vermonters in those areas who wish to install
solar on their homes or businesses are unable to do so at this time. Utilities, regulators, clean
energy advocates and other stakeholders are trying to find ways to address this and maximize the
use of our renewable energy resources.
Electric buses could serve to both increase load in grid constrained areas and provide storage
capacity for Vermont’s renewable generation for use during times of low generation by using
renewably generated electricity during the day (when there is high solar generation at lower
prices), and storing energy in their batteries when they are not in use that can be used to
supplement our grid when renewable generation is lower, and demand is high (in the evening,
when people are using lights and heating homes). It is important to note, however, that using
these same buses for transit services would reduce the hours they could serve as grid resources.
School Buses as Public Transport: School buses are located in every part of the state and
operate on predictable routes and schedules, as well as predictable downtimes, providing ample
opportunities for charging. These buses could be used to combine public transit and school bus
routes.
28. Leverage Health Care Partnerships
Metric assumptions:

- 112 -



The savings impact was based on the finding from an ongoing health impact assessment by the
Health Department, where it was estimated that participation in an employer transportation
benefits program would reduce single occupant vehicle use by 18 percent, resulting in $240 in
annual health benefits per commuter per year associated with increased physical activity,
reduced motor vehicle collisions, and improved air quality. If this 18 percent single-occupant
vehicle use reduction was achieved by all 319,484 workers 16 years and older in Vermont
(which is similar to the CEP targets), the aggregate health benefit would be over $75 million per
year.
The investment needed rating was based on the very low/no cost for actions 4 & 5, low cost for
action 2, and the potentially high cost for actions 1 & 3 to support the programs and
infrastructure necessary to increase active and healthy living. Because the expected savings are
related to improved health and reduced health care expenditures, mechanisms should be explored
for investing health sector funds towards community smart growth and transportation strategies
that provide health benefits.
The ease rating was based on the fact that all of the recommended actions are already occurring
to some extent, though the scope and scale of each could be expanded. For the no/low cost
actions (2, 4, & 5), there are minimal barriers to completing these actions. For the potentially
high cost actions (1 & 3), increasing the financial investment may be challenging, and could
require developing innovative new funding or administrative mechanisms.
30. Targeted Land Conservation:
Savings figures are based on impact functioning ecosystems can have on flood protection.
Watson et al. evaluated the flood prevention savings of one wetland complex in Middlebury, VT
on Otter Creek. They estimate the wetland provided annual flood savings of at least $126,000.
While this cannot be extrapolated across the state, it does provide an indication of the value of
functioning, non-impacted ecosystems on flood storage and prevention.7
34-42 Additional Information Related to Carbon Sequestration
Even small changes in the soil carbon pool have large-scale effects both on agricultural
productivity and on the greenhouse gas balance. Maintaining carbon-rich soils, restoring and
improving degraded agricultural lands and, more generally, increasing soil carbon, play an
important role in addressing the three-fold challenge of food security, adaptation of food systems
and people to climate change, and mitigation of anthropogenic emissions. According to the “4
by 1000” initiative—launched by participants during the 2015 COP 21 in Paris-- an annual
growth rate of 0.4 percent in the soil carbon stocks, or 4‰ per year, would halt the increase
in atmospheric CO2 concentration stemming from human activities.
Growing plants and trees are the most fundamental way we “capture” CO2 from our atmosphere.
Plants breathe in carbon dioxide and through photosynthesis, convert a portion of the carbon to
plant biomass, both above and below ground. The science around carbon sequestration in soils is
complex, yet research points clearly to two important principals. First, reducing soil disturbance

keeps existing soil carbon in the soil. Second, while we have lost much of our agricultural soil
carbon through 100 years of cropping, that loss can be reversed by adopting a reasonable set of
conservation practices. In the temperate regions, estimates suggest such practices can add a ton
of sequestered carbon per acre per year, on the average, for 10 to 20 years. Some soils can add
more, and some have a lower sequestration potential. Generally, the moist soils of the northeast
are better able to sequester carbon than the arid conditions of the west. With an estimated onethird of the arable land in agriculture globally, it is critical that we find ways to increase soil
carbon in agricultural systems.
Farmers in Vermont manage 1.25 million acres of land, impacting 20 percent of the total land in
the state. About half of that land is in active crop production including nearly 100,000 acres of
corn, soybeans, cereal grains and vegetables; 338,000 acres of hay for livestock feed and
biomass crops for bedding and mulch; 139,000 acres of permanent pasture. The rest is over
500,000 acres of farmer woodlots plus farmsteads and undeveloped land (USDA NASS, 2016).
In 2016, a total of $776 M of all agriculture products were sold including $505 M from milk
sales.
Over the past decade, educators, service providers, and partners in the agricultural community
have worked closely with farmers to increase the use of conservation practices largely for their
water quality benefits.8 Cover cropping helps keep soil in place, reduces moisture stress,
increases soil organic matter, and adds nitrogen and other nutrients. Pasture management,
including rotational grazing and adding compost, increases productivity, soil carbon and plant
diversity. Careful nutrient management reduces run-off and fertilizer expense and can curb
greenhouse gas emissions from soils in the form of nitrous oxide, while also reducing costs.
Beside the water quality benefits, these practices increase soil resilience, maintain or enhance
productivity, sequester carbon in soil, and in many cases, reduce the emission of greenhouse
gasses.

8

Cover crops are grass or grain seeded either during the growing season or after harvesting of an annual crop, usually corn.
Cover crops decrease the potential for erosion of bare soil during the non-growing months, while increasing soil health, organic
matter and nutrients. Reduced tillage is a practice that minimizes soil disturbance and allows crop residue or stubble to stay on
the soil. The cover residues (often in conjunction with a cover crop) protect the soil from erosion, and the soil structure and
health are improved by avoiding annual plowing and heavy machinery. Cover crops are now used on about a third of the corn
acres, and are required on some fields as part of the State’s Required Agricultural Practices.
