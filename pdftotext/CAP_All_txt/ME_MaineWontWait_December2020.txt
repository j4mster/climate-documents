F R O M G O V E R N O R J A N E T T. M I L L S
In the fall of 1970, 11-year-old Suzanne Clune wrote a letter to her United States senator.
She lived on the banks of the Little Androscoggin River, a once-pristine tributary where deer could see their reflection when drinking from the water and where spring pine and chokeberry blossoms “filled the air with the sweetest
smell on earth.” That was before toxic chemicals polluted the waters and before noxious waste formed swells of thick
discolored foam that ran downstream and coated the river banks.
“Now in any season,” Suzanne wrote to Senator Edmund S. Muskie, “you can smell the most sickening smell on
earth, a stench that left frogs ‘gasping for air.’ I am sick of the river like this. Please do something about it.” Suzanne
signed her letter, “One who loves Maine.”
Suzanne’s letter sparked Senator Muskie’s career-long fight for clean air and clean water. Today, as a result of his
actions, the Little Androscoggin River is restored as a pristine waterway, like the Androscoggin, the Kennebec, and
the Penobscot rivers — places where we now fish and sail and swim, places we love.
I am grateful that Suzanne did not wait to act.
Before us now is another threat — one that jeopardizes not only Maine’s natural resources but our state’s economic
and social wellbeing, too. From our rocky coast to the western foothills, our pine tree forests, our bountiful farmland,
and the people and creatures of all kinds who call these places home, the climate crisis poses a direct and immediate
threat.
When I think about the current crisis, I think about Suzanne. I think about Senator Muskie, Senator George Mitchell, Senator William Cohen, former legislators like Harry Richardson, Hoddy Hildreth, and Sherry Huber — environmental champions bound not by ideology or political party but by a shared commitment to preserve and protect
our cherished home, Maine.
I think of Maine’s indigenous people whose longtime stewardship and connection to the land is threatened by global
warming. I think of thought leaders like Pope Francis, who requested an international conversation about the future
of the planet, a conversation “which includes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, and its
human roots, concern and affect us all." I think of our children and grandchildren and of generations yet to come.
With this crisis on our doorstep, we — like Suzanne Clune — can’t wait.
We must act now to honor the legacy of Maine’s environmental stewards who bequeathed this precious place to us,
to preserve our state for our children and grandchildren to enjoy as we do, and to build a thriving economy with
opportunities for growth far into the future.
Maine can’t wait to heed the warnings of scientists who tell us we cannot delay reducing carbon emissions to stem
climate impacts, or preparing our communities to withstand extreme weather events, flooding, and warming that
climate change is causing as we speak.
Maine can’t wait to improve the lives of Maine people through climate action: weatherizing homes and installing
heat pumps to provide both comfort and savings; improving transportation options; increasing access to broadband;
and creating greater energy efficiency to lower the maintenance and costs of our homes, cars, buses, and businesses.

Maine can’t wait to strengthen our economy by investing in renewable-energy infrastructure and providing
good-paying jobs in clean energy and energy efficiency.
Maine can’t wait to stem the loss of more than $4 billion a year which we send to out-of-state fossil-fuel companies every year, and instead keep that money here at home and transition to homegrown clean and renewable
energy to power our homes, fight climate change, and move us toward energy independence.
Maine won’t wait to protect our natural resources and the industries that depend on them — forest products,
agriculture, fishing and aquaculture — and support efforts to fight climate change while innovating and expanding our workforce.
Most of all, Maine can’t wait to make the most of this extraordinary moment in time. This plan against climate
change comes in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic which has caused significant economic and social
turmoil in Maine, across the country, and around the globe. It might be easier to put off climate action until
calmer times. But Maine can’t wait. Maine shouldn’t wait. And Maine won’t wait.
This pandemic has only highlighted the need to diversify our economy, expand Maine’s workforce, and address
the devastating consequences of climate change. The opportunity for a brighter, sustainable future is here and
now. And the need is greater than ever before.
As Governor, this is what I propose:
We more than double the number of Maine’s clean-energy and energy-efficiency jobs by 2030. These 30,000 jobs
will fight climate change while providing new opportunities to Maine working men and women and advancing
long-term prosperity for our state.
I pledge that my Administration will support the outcomes laid out in this Climate Action Plan in every way
possible.
I will submit bold legislation and proposals for public and private investment. We will seek federal officials etc.
as partners in this effort, and keep a steady focus on our progress.
Eleven-year old Suzanne Clune’s letter to Senator Muskie 50 years ago was a call to action of that era.
Let this plan be today’s call to action — once again to protect the natural beauty of our state, to improve the lives
of our families and the livelihoods of our people, and to ward off future natural disasters and economic crises.
Because, like Suzanne, we too are “ones who love Maine,” and we must do our best to preserve and protect it.
Sincerely,

Janet T. Mills
Governor

FROM THE CO-CHAIRS
Climate change represents the greatest threat of our age. There is widespread consensus on the urgent need to
take action. But, during Maine’s first major planning process on climate in more than a decade, the COVID19 pandemic and resulting recession put an unprecedented strain on our communities, businesses, and people.
The fast-moving devastation of COVID-19 exposed weaknesses in our national crisis response that mirrored the
gradual effects of climate change, from inherent challenges of emergency preparedness and global supply chains,
to the inequities and unequal burdens that economic and social disruptions have on vulnerable populations.
As the pandemic raged, grim reminders of climate change continued to emerge in Maine. The hottest ocean
temperatures in the Gulf of Maine in a single day were recorded, and the most severe fire season and drought
conditions in years punished the state, with devastating consequences for farmers.
Nevertheless, over the course of 14 months, hundreds of Maine people — despite the pandemic, while working
from home and straining Internet connections, with kids learning remotely and dogs barking in the background
— spent hundreds of their precious hours, one Zoom call at a time, considering and recommending actions to
combat climate change.
Thousands more Maine people offered their climate concerns, observations, ideas, and encouragement to the
Maine Climate Council, which was strongly urged to look past present-day pandemic challenges to set a course
for bold action. Their dedication despite COVID-19 helped us all find our strength.
We are blessed to live in a state with world-class scientific institutions and researchers who helped us expand our
knowledge. The expert Scientific and Technical Subcommittee created a foundation for the Council to understand the latest data, facts, and projections, as we know them today, about the effects of climate change in Maine.
The Council’s working groups — Transportation; Buildings, Housing, and Infrastructure; Energy; Natural
and Working Lands; Coastal and Marine; and Community Resilience Planning, Emergency Management, and
Public Health – presented robust, united strategies for action, sourced from the diverse expertise, interest, and
concerns of their members including communities, businesses, organizations, government leaders, and youth.
The Maine Climate Council —
­ a group of 39 committed leaders, experts, and advocates — took these detailed
strategies and added groundbreaking economic and equity analyses and greenhouse emissions modeling to
further inform their decision-making to develop this plan.
Lastly, we agreed — with full consensus — on this four-year plan for climate action. While we didn’t always
agree easily, the plan reflects many of the diverse challenges Maine faces in the fight against climate change. It is
centered on data-driven outcomes to achieve the ambitious emissions reductions goals laid out in law — a 45%
reduction by 2030 and 80% by 2050.
Beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the Plan also focuses on several other key goals. First is creating
economic opportunity as we undertake climate and energy transitions. Second is preparing our communities,
people, and economy for the impacts of climate change like rising sea levels, increased flooding, and changing
weather conditions.

6

M A IN E WON’T WA IT



And finally, to advance equity as we undertake this work, to ensure communities and citizens who are often
left behind can benefit from climate solutions by having access to opportunities and protection from threats.
Consistent and bold action on climate, over the next four years and into the decades beyond, will create a better
future for our state and the next generations.
It will create thriving new economic sectors — from clean energy and efficiency to the forest products economy
of the future, while ensuring a clean environment. It will save money for Maine people, towns, schools, and
business each month from lower heating bills. It will improve rural transportation systems and open access to
food grown and harvested by our fellow Mainers.
The pandemic also taught us that action to improve public health and emergency management systems, and to
better prepare our communities, people, and infrastructure for the next crisis is critically important and saves lives.
Every individual, business, organization, and leader in Maine can play a role in making this plan a reality. This
collective effort will be key to our success against the crisis that climate change poses for our state, nation, and
world.
This starts with meeting the challenges of climate with action. That’s what this Plan does. And with your help
and your action, we can make the most of this moment to address the challenge of our age.
But we can’t do it alone. Please join us in building a better future for Maine.

EXECUTIVE SUMM ARY

I

n June 2019, Governor Janet Mills signed LD 1679 into law, with strong support from the Maine Legislature,
to create the Maine Climate Council. The Council — an assembly of scientists, industry leaders, bipartisan
local and state officials, and engaged citizens — was charged with developing this four-year Climate Action
Plan to put Maine on a trajectory to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 and 80% by 2050, and
achieve carbon neutrality by 2045.
Starting in September of that year, the Council and six working groups and a subcommittee — totaling more
than 200 Maine people with a diverse set of experiences and backgrounds — began this work. This four-year
Climate Action Plan, Maine Won’t Wait, is the consensus result of those months of painstaking study, dialogue,
discussion, and public deliberation to determine the steps Maine must take to combat climate change.
Backed by the first comprehensive scientific and technical assessment about climate change in Maine in a decade,
Maine Won’t Wait outlines the urgency with which Maine must slow the effects of climate change to make a
meaningful contribution to global efforts, while also taking bold action to prepare Maine people, communities,
and environment for climate-related harms to come.
At the same time, Maine Won’t Wait details how addressing climate change presents transformational economic
opportunities, such as from the growth of clean-energy sources and incentives for significant consumer, business and industrial investment in energy efficiency through weatherization, cutting-edge building materials,
and alternative energy sources. These considerations take on added importance given the economic disruption
caused by COVID-19.
Staving off climate change also protects the character of Maine — the pristine forests, rugged coastlines, and
local farms that depend on strong, healthy, and vibrant natural ecosystems. These important natural and working lands are most at risk from climate change, and yet their ability to store carbon is a powerful tool against the
harmful effects of climate change.
The failure to act against the effects of climate change carries a great risk for Maine, as doing nothing will cause
costly damage to Maine’s buildings and infrastructure, vulnerable ecosystems, iconic species, and public health.
This is why Maine won’t wait, and why hundreds of volunteers gave their time and talents to develop this Climate
Action Plan, and countless more Maine people offered insights, opinions, and inspiration during the process to
inform this set of strategies that truly represents a plan that is right for Maine.

Reduce Maine’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions

While Maine has been among the leading U.S. states when it comes to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions,
significant progress must still be made to meet the state’s 2030 and 2050 targets.  

Avoid the Impacts and Costs of Inaction

Maine must take action to ensure that our people, environment, economy, and society are more resilient to the
impacts of climate change that are now occurring. While mitigating the causes of climate change and better
preparing Maine for its impacts will require significant public and private investment, inaction will cost Maine
substantially more, and those costs will accelerate over time.

Foster Economic Opportunity and Prosperity

Today, as Maine charts the course for economic recovery, many of the proposed solutions in this Climate Action
Plan can leverage Maine’s strengths and reverse workforce trends by supporting good-paying jobs that attract new
workers and families, growing the economy, protecting key economic sectors most at risk from climate change,
and fostering innovation in new business sectors that will drive climate solutions.

Advance Equity through Maine’s Climate Response

Like other dislocations and disruptions to society, from recessions to pandemics, the costs of Maine’s inaction on
climate change will be acutely borne by vulnerable communities, which should be given foremost consideration
for opportunities and support from climate action. A new Equity Subcommittee of the Maine Climate Council
will support ongoing planning and implementation of Maine’s climate strategies to ensure shared benefits across
diverse populations of Maine people and to understand any concerns for implementation.

IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN
The release of this Climate Action Plan is not the end of the Council’s work, but the beginning. To
implement the Plan, government leaders must recognize their responsibility in this moment and move
with urgency to take action, prioritize resources, and develop metrics to track progress and ensure
accountability to the public.
The Implementation Chart for the Plan identifies lead agencies assigned to each of the specific outcomes
assigned to the climate strategies. The agencies will work with partner organizations to implement the
actions, and progress will be monitored quarterly by the Maine Climate Council and working groups.
The responsibility for appropriation and revenues rests with the Governor and Maine State Legislature,
with similar processes at the municipal, tribal, regional, and federal levels. Yet fighting climate change
cannot be shouldered by government alone.

PUBLIC INPUT A ND SUPPORT
Hearing directly from Maine people — stakeholders, experts, local and regional leaders, legislators, businesses,
youth, and the general public — was central in creating this plan and will continue to be important in the work
ahead to turn the plan strategies into action.
From the beginning, Council working groups included 30-40 members with diverse perspectives and expertise.
Each working group developed its draft recommendations in public via public meetings, conference calls, surveys,
and individual and organizational input — a process that endured the rapid transition to virtual communication demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In summer 2020, the Maine Climate Council released feedback surveys on climatecouncil.maine.gov about
climate change and the working group strategies, which garnered more than 4,400 responses from more than
75% of Maine’s zip codes.
The Council also received many comments through its website from hundreds more people, stakeholders, advocacy, and industry groups. Staff, working group chairs, and members also conducted several presentations to
stakeholder and community groups about aspects of the Plan.
This meant some communities, especially those with insufficient access to the Internet, are underrepresented in
this Plan. As the Plan is implemented, Council leaders and staff will work to continue to find additional ways
to reach these communities such as lower-income and rural residents, older adults, tribal communities, people
of color, and new Mainers.
For this plan to be successful, the support and engagement of Maine people is critical: to mobilize a broad coalition of state, local, regional, and tribal governments, nonprofits, academic intuitions, and private interests taking
collaborative, decisive action.

PL A N METRICS
To monitor progress, clear metrics for Maine’s climate goals are critical for both informing the public about
whether policies are having intended outcomes, and for making evidence-based adjustments, enhancements, or
replacements to policies in pursuit of our 2030, 2045, and 2050 targets. Suggested metrics to help Maine gauge
its progress towards climate change goals are outlined on page 106.

FUNDING A ND FINA NCING
Climate action requires leveraging a variety of funding sources and innovative financing mechanisms to support
sector-level transformations and the ability of Maine lenders to make crucial long-term investments in climate-focused projects and initiatives.
This Plan, however, is emerging amid unprecedented conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which
is stretching state revenues and many family budgets and has had a dangerous and disproportionate effect on
Maine’s most vulnerable citizens.
This grave situation illustrates the urgent need to prepare our people, communities, and economy for disruptions
that climate change will cause. Investments to create a sustainable economy that is less reliant on global supply
chains and imported fossil fuels, while leveraging Maine’s abundance to source essential goods, from fresh food
to building supplies, will reinforce the bedrock of Maine’s economy and enable families to withstand major
challenges in the future.
For a detailed funding and financing options for the Climate Action Plan, see page 103.

As greenhouse gas emissions drive dramatic changes
in Earth’s climate systems, the warming trends documented in Maine are more prominent than those

Two effects of warming oceans are melting ice and
rising sea levels, of which the latter in Maine is accelerating. Sea levels along Maine’s coast have risen about 1
foot/century (approximately 0.1 inches/year) in the last
few decades, after rising at 0.6 to 0.7 feet/century since
the early 1900s. About half of the last century’s sea-level
rise in Maine has occurred since the early 1990s.
As Maine’s relative sea level rises, coastal communities
and ecosystems will see increased frequency of nuisance
flooding, inundation of coastal lowlands with saltwater, erosion, and loss of dry beaches, sand dunes, and
other habitats. A 1.6-foot sea-level rise may submerge
67% of Maine’s coastal sand dunes and reduce the dry
beach area by 43%, which could happen by 2050 or
earlier and would have significant impacts on coastal
tourism.

Sea level has risen in Maine over the last century and is expected to continue rising along Maine’s coastline well beyond 2100.
The Scientific and Technical Subcommittee recommends the State commit to manage for 1.5 feet of relative sea-level rise by
2050 and 3.9 feet of relative sea-level rise by 2100 (green arrows in the figure), and consider preparing to manage for 8.8 feet
of sea-level rise by 2100, especially for low-risk-tolerant infrastructure. (See the Scientific Assessment of Climate Change and

As part of its report, the Scientific and

sea-level rise projections for Maine’s
coastal areas. Based on those projections,
the Maine Climate Council recommends
the state commit to manage for 1.5 feet
of relative sea-level rise by 2050, and
3.9 feet by 2100. The Council also recommends the state prepare to manage for 3

tree species.
Maine’s forests and forestry sector are important resources for meeting our climate goals. Forests
sequester over 60% of our annual carbon emissions
(approximately 75% including forest growth and durable products).

Climate shifts are also affecting Maine’s diverse agriculture sector, which generates over $660 million of
direct value into Maine’s economy. Warming temperatures and increasingly variable precipitation, including droughts and extreme weather events, are causing
damage to farm livelihoods, impacting farmers, workChanging climate conditions, particularly more ers, crops, and livestock. Warming temperatures may

This scientific, scenario-based approach to sea-level rise
allows Maine to consider a range of potential outcomes,
as well as the risk tolerance of different kinds of infrastructure, and it has been adopted by several New
England states and municipalities.

Climate change will affect all sectors of Maine’s economy, from tourism, agriculture, and
forestry to transportation and trade. Warmer temperatures, more rain, and sea-level rise will
increase the incidence of flooding and damage to property and infrastructure.

All told, the scientific assessment of climate change in Maine is clear. Our state must prepare
for the harmful impacts from climate change now, while striving to reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions to avoid potential worst-case scenarios that may otherwise lie ahead.

he consensus of climate scientists worldwide
is that the world is facing unprecedented
challenges associated with climate change as
a result of human activities — primarily the combustion of fossil fuels that emits carbon dioxide (CO2 ) and
other greenhouse gases. The increased challenges of
extreme weather activity and rising temperatures highlight that these changes are already here.

Climate science indicates at least 1.8° F (1.0°C) of
global warming has happened since pre-industrial
times, and that the Earth will likely warm by 2.7°F
(1.5°C) between 2030 and 2052 at current emissions
rates. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

To limit warming and reduce the severe impacts of
climate change, the science is clear that the world must
reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.
In 2019, Governor Janet Mills signed legislation to
require the reduction of Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions 45% by 2030 and by at least 80% by 2050, and to
create Climate Action Plans every four years to ensure
the state has a roadmap for actions to accomplish these
targets. In addition to these reductions set forth in
law, Governor Mills has signed an Executive Order
committing Maine to an additional target of carbon
neutrality by 2045.
The strategies in this Climate Action Plan offer specific
actions that support the state’s meaningful contributions to the international efforts to slow global climate
change, in alignment with the scientifically rigorous
emissions reductions goals recommended by the IPCC.
The 2016 Paris Climate Agreement aims to keep a
global temperature rise this century well below 2°C
above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit
the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. These

same goals have been adopted by the United States
Climate Alliance (USCA), a bipartisan coalition of
25 states including Maine formed when the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement.
While Maine has been among the leading U.S. states
when it comes to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions,
reducing our annual emissions from a high of 26.53
million metric tons of CO2 equivalents (MMTCO2e)
in 2002 to 17.5 MMTCO2e in 2017 (a reduction of
34% from 2002 levels, or 17.5% from 1990 levels),
significant progress must still be made to meet the
state’s 2030 and 2050 targets.
In 2017, most of Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions came from transportation, followed by residential and commercial buildings and operations, then
industrial sources, and lastly from electricity generation. This Climate Action Plan outlines strategies to
reduce emissions from all sectors, with an emphasis
on the most significant sources of Maine’s emissions.

The Maine Climate Council analyzed the future
scenarios for Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions, modeling different pathways for reductions and the status
quo. There is always some uncertainty in projections
and models, but they are a valuable tool for quantifying
the impacts of particular strategies and clarifying the
timing required to achieve our state’s emissionsreductions goals.
The analysis showed that if Maine continues on a
“business as usual” path, emissions will slowly decline
through 2030 and then flatten out in later years. Under
that scenario, our 2050 emissions will be 13.8 million
metric tons, which is 9.6 million metric tons greater
than our 2050 target. In this scenario, transportation

accounts for 41% of emissions in 2050 and remains
Maine’s largest emissions source.
Figure 6 demonstrates a potential pathway that
utilizes the strategies proposed by the Maine Climate
Council in this plan, including a transition over time
to a largely electrified transportation and buildings
sector, combined with a transition to a clean electricity
sector, allowing for significant greenhouse emissions
reductions.
This pathway meets Maine’s 2030 and 2050 emissions-reduction goals. By 2030, total emissions are
11.67 million metric tons, equal to the target of 45%
below 1990 levels. Total emissions in 2050 are 3.72
million metric tons, or 82% below 1990 levels.

Even as we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions to meet our reduction goals, Maine’s carbon neutrality goal of
net-zero emissions by 2045 will require our natural and working lands — such as forests, farms, and coastal lands
— to store carbon (or sequester that carbon in natural materials) for decades to come. Enhancing these systems
for greater carbon storage capacity, while continuing to provide critical economic, recreation, and habitat benefits and drinking-water protection, will help Maine reach our goals and support healthy natural and working
forests, farmland, and coastal lands.
Curbing emissions can also be done while growing a state’s economy. The 25 states of the United States Climate
Alliance, including Maine, are reducing emissions and growing their economies at a faster pace than non-USCA
states. Maine cut emissions by 32% from 2005 to 2017 while the state’s GDP grew.

Of the multiple threats Maine faces from climate
change, flooding carries the largest financial risk. For
coastal communities, unaddressed sea-level rise and
repeated storm-surge flooding could cost Maine $17.5
billion in building damage from 2020 to 2050. In
inland communities, the value of buildings threatened
by flooding from intense storms between 2020 and
2050 is estimated at $1.8 billion.
For coastal communities, modeling showed 21,000
jobs may be lost due to the cumulative impact of coastal
storms and sea-level rise between 2020 and 2050. Similarly, flood risk to inland communities could put nearly
3,300 forestry, agriculture, and tourism jobs at risk.
Vulnerability mapping of Maine also shows that, unless
action is taken, at least six wastewater treatment plants
will be at risk of permanent inundation from sea-level
rise by 2050. The replacement costs for these facilities
will be $31 million to $93 million.
Coastal beaches and dunes draw more than 13 million
visitors each year, which in turn supports many coastal
tourism economies. Coastal visitors spent $1.7 billion
in 2018 — an average of $125 per person.

By 2050, sea-level rise and erosion may
shrink Maine’s total dry beach area by 42%,
decreasing visits by more than 1 million
people and lowering annual tourism spending by $136 million.

If Maine’s coastal dunes, saltmarshes, and eelgrasses
are lost to erosion and sea-level rise, valuable ecosystems will be wiped out. Coastal dunes protect buildings, infrastructure, and sensitive wildlife habitat from
pounding waves and flooding, an ecosystem service
valued at $72 million annually. Saltmarshes and
submerged eelgrasses protect coastlines from erosion
and provide critical fish-spawning habitat, nitrogen
removal, and other ecosystem services that support
Maine’s coastal communities and commercial fisheries.
The loss of these ecosystem services due to sea-level rise
is estimated at between $34 million and $104 million
by 2030 and between $103 million and $260 million
by 2100.
Nearly $700 million in direct value annually (and
more in supporting businesses) from fisheries and
aquaculture are also at risk from warming and
acidifying ocean waters. Maine’s lobster fishery alone
had landings worth $485 million in 2019. Southern

New England’s precipitous drop in lobster landings
over the last few decades coincided with warming
waters, offering a clear warning to Maine. As lobster
populations move northward with their preferred
cooler habitats, some projections suggest lobster abundance in the Gulf of Maine could decline 45% by 2050.
If this occurs, Maine’s cumulative GDP would fall by
approximately $800 million over 30 years and reduce
the state’s economic output by $1.3 billion.

ongoing focus on issues of equity is essential in Maine’s response to climate change.
Throughout implementation of this
Climate Action Plan, continuous engagement with diverse groups of Maine people
and communities, especially those most
impacted by climate and climate actions,
is required for the development of fair and
effective programs and policies.
A new Equity Subcommittee of the
Maine Climate Council will support
ongoing planning and implementation
of Maine’s climate strategies to ensure
shared benefits across diverse populations
of Maine people and to understand any
concerns for implementation. The Equity
Subcommittee will be tasked in 2021 with
setting clear equity outcomes for proposed
actions, monitoring progress, and making
recommendations to ensure that programs
and benefits reach the intended populations and communities.
An Equity Assessment of Maine’s Climate
Goals was conducted by the University of
Maine’s Mitchell Center for Sustainability,
at the request of the Maine Climate Council and the Governor’s Office of Policy
Innovation and the Future, and provided
high-level recommendations and detailed
considerations for many of the proposed
climate strategies in this plan. Where the
Equity Assessment called for further analysis of equity impacts, the Equity Subcommittee’s ongoing engagement with diverse
communities will inform the development
of climate policies and programs.

Why is climate an important issue to you and the
Penobscot Nation?
The Penobscot Nation, like the other Wabanaki
and Indigenous Nations in North America, sees the
earth as a living breathing being that is part of our
families, communities, and central to our survival.
It is part of our culture to be stewards of the earth,
and as we grow and evolve we hold steady to that
part of our philosophy as a people. I was honored
to be asked to sit on the Climate Council because
part of the tensions between the tribes and the
state has to do with natural resources, and part of
the healing should be coming together when we
can for the common good of Maine.
How will an equity focus on climate contribute to
the Plan’s success?
Frontline communities like tribal nations, new
Mainers, those in poverty, people of color, and
more are disproportionately affected by the
climate crisis. If we overlook their needs and experiences, we are not only doing them a disservice,
we are setting back all of our work because it will
be less effective in meeting our goals. A society is
only as strong as its most vulnerable populations,
and this holds true in climate work. As we make
policy, we need to work from a place of inclusivity
and equity to make sure our work is lasting and
meaningful.
What do you want the Equity Subcommittee to
accomplish?
I hope to continue important discussions around
the intersections of climate and equity. As a
subcommittee, we can inform the Council’s work as
well as the legislative process. I am hoping to shed
a light on the experiences of marginalized people
in Maine and how the climate crisis
affects us, as well as solutions
based on thoughtful consideration of these stories.

ransportation is responsible for 54% of Maine’s annual greenhouse gas emissions.
To meet our emissions-reductions goals by 2030 and 2050, our state must pivot
to the future by pursuing aggressive transition strategies and innovative solutions
within this important sector.
When emissions are analyzed by vehicle type, 59% of Maine’s transportation-related
emissions are from light-duty passenger cars and trucks; 27% are from medium- and
heavy-duty trucks; and the remaining 14% come from rail, marine, aviation, and utility
equipment vehicles.
The most significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in Maine’s transportation
sector will come through the long-term and large-scale electrification of our transportation systems, combined with strategies to increase the efficiency of gas- and diesel-powered
vehicles, and to reduce the number of miles Mainers drive through expanded options and
funding for public transportation, increased broadband deployment across the state, and
support for policies that encourage development of housing, schools, and shopping areas
in pedestrian-friendly downtowns and villages.
In addition to reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to achieve Maine’s emissions-reduction goals, there are also major health benefits associated with cleaner air from reduced
transportation emissions, including reduced nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter.
Maine’s rural character and relatively low emissions from other sectors — like electricity
generation — make our transportation emissions disproportionately high compared to
other states. The average Maine vehicle travels approximately 12,000 miles per year. An
analysis of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in Maine found that 65% of our driving occurs
on rural roads, with 35% in urban and suburban areas. Most of these total miles are driven
in the southern half of Maine.
Maine’s transportation emissions also include emissions attributable to visitors to Maine
— an estimated 37.4 million seasonal visitors and tourists in 2019, according to the Maine
Office of Tourism.

In 2021, ecomaine of Portland is expected to become the first company in the U.S. to use all-EVs for waste
hauling powered by its own waste-to-energy operation. The purchase of the EVs to replace diesel-powered
trucks was made possible in large part by a combined grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s
Diesel Emissions Reduction Act program and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The grant,
combined with funds matched by ecomaine, allowed the company to secure two electric trucks from the Lion
Electric Company of St. Jerome, Quebec. In addition to reduced maintenance costs, ecomaine expects to save
75% on fuel compared to diesel over the first six years.

By 2022, create policies, incentives, and pilot programs to
encourage the adoption of electric, hybrid, and alternativefuel medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles, public transportation,

Maine’s clean electric grid means that EVs emit significantly less greenhouse gas emissions per mile compared
to gas or diesel vehicles. EVs currently account for less
than 0.5% of registered vehicles in Maine. However, the
market for, and supply of, EVs is expected to increase
in coming years, due to advancements in technology,
reductions in cost, and growth in consumer demand.
Maine is also one of 13 states that has adopted California’s emissions standards under the Clean Air Act,
a foundational policy for accelerating EV adoption.
Adoption targets to incentivize the EV market are also
growing; California, New Jersey, and Quebec have
committed to reach 100% zero emission new car sales
by 2035, with other states considering similar goals.
Delivery companies like Amazon, UPS, and FedEx
are also shifting to electrify their delivery fleet, while
other companies, like furniture giant IKEA, have
directed their supply chain to “use electric vehicle or
other zero-emissions solutions” for delivery.

PHEVs can also be part of a potential transition to
increased electric driving, with more and more vehicles
on the market getting from 20 to as many as 100 miles
from a single charge before utilizing their gas engine.
EVs and other zero-emissions vehicles in the heavyduty market are also a key target for emissions reductions, with early examples like school buses, garbage
trucks, and public transit buses arriving in Maine in
late 2020 and 2021. The heavy-duty market is important to long-term emissions reductions. Evolving technology innovations with new electric and hydrogen
vehicles emerging in both national and international
markets will help support reduced emissions in this
sector.
To outline a specific plan to accelerate the widespread
adoption of EVs, PHEVs, and other clean-car technologies in Maine, an “EV Roadmap” will be completed by
2022. This statewide EV Roadmap will identify necessary policies, programs, and regulatory changes needed
to meet the state’s EV and transportation emission
reduction goals, including strategic planning, incentive
programs, charging infrastructure, consumer engagement, as well as transition and equity considerations.

Travis Ritchie, a STEM teacher at Geiger Middle School in Lewiston, is co-founder of the
Maine Electric Vehicle Association (a community of EV enthusiasts) and a former EV
mechanic. He leads “EV 101” seminars for prospective EV owners looking to flip the switch —
­
which Maine will need to reach projected EV targets for curbing greenhouse gas emissions.
Why does an EV make sense for you?
I like driving but not commuting. I struggled between having a car I enjoyed and a great
commuter that cut my driving costs. Prior to my EV, I would tally my fuel and maintenance
expenses from commuting and say, ‘What a waste.’ Now, I have the best of both worlds using
an EV as a daily driver. It costs pennies to get to work, and I have the instant torque to keep
me interested in the drive.
What do you think is the biggest obstacle to EV adoption?
Range and cost are clearly the two most obvious hurdles, but I would say education is a close
third. I think if more people understood how EVs work, how you don’t need a public charger
if you can plug in at home, the reduced maintenance costs, and winter driving characteristics, they’d look forward to owning one someday. Most people I know can’t buy a new car,
but once there is a better market for used EVs (choice and all-wheel-drive options), they will
be on board.
What do you think of the Council’s recommendation on EVs?
The fact that they are considering the environment as well as the economy makes me
impressed already. I am worried about the future of our planet, and I think EVs are one of
many steps that must happen to transition to a sustainable future. I am already taking action,
and hope to continue driving EVs and eventually switch to sustainable energy sources for
heat and electricity in the future. I think the governor and legislature should try to find a
way to include small, local businesses in the implementation of this plan wherever possible.

design, low-resistance tires, and reduced idling. Voluntary participation should be encouraged in Maine to
significantly increase participation through loans or
grants, by ensuring technology is available, and recognizing excellence within the program.
Maine should promote the increased production and
use of biofuels in applications where electrification is
not currently practical. Unlike petroleum-based diesel,
biofuels are based on plant- or algae-based carbon that
was recently in the atmosphere, which means that when
these fuels are burned, net emissions are lower than for
fossil fuels. When these fuels are produced in Maine,
there are economic benefits from their production that
support both the forest-products industry and rural
communities, and further emissions reductions from
reduced fuel-transportation costs.
Federal fuel-economy standards (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy [CAFE] standards) regulate how
many miles vehicles must travel on 1 gallon of fuel, and
these standards have already led to emission reductions
in Maine’s transportation sector. The Trump Administration rolled back the Obama-era CAFE, so the
current standards are very weak. Maine has adopted
California vehicle standards which are more stringent than federal standards. The state should continue
to support efforts to push ongoing improvement in
national CAFE standards.

Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled
•

Reduce light-duty VMT over time,
achieving 10% reductions by 2025
and 20% by 2030.

•

Reduce heavy-duty VMT by 4% by
2030.

•

Deploy high-speed broadband to
95% of Maine homes by 2025 and
99% by 2030.

•

By 2024, establish state coordination, strengthen land-use policies, and use state grant programs
to encourage development that
supports the reduction of VMT.

•

Increase public transportation funding to the national median of $5 per
capita by 2024.

•

Relaunch GO Maine to significantly
increase shared public commuting
options by 2022.

By enabling and encouraging Mainers and visitors
to drive less, while offering more alternative transportation options, we can reduce our greenhouse gas
emissions.
Greater access to virtual work, medicine, education,
and other opportunities that allow people to utilize
online services without driving is key to this strategy.
This action has assumed greater interest and relevance
due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the growing
prevalence of remote work, but it’s dependent on expansion of high-speed broadband Internet access.

44

M A IN E WON’T WA IT



Expanding broadband is also a key recommendation in the state’s 10-year
economic strategy and was one of the top priorities identified by the Governor’s Economic Recovery Committee to stabilize Maine’s economy against
the economic damage caused by COVID-19.

These recommendations align with a recent finding
that one in six Americans is expected to switch permanently to remote work for at least two days each week
after the pandemic subsides, and that over 33% of U.S.
companies say the practice will remain “more common”
at their company after the pandemic is over.

These kind of cities, villages, and communities facilitate walking and biking, and support easier public
transportation and ride-sharing options. Co-benefits
include improved public health, reduced costs of infrastructure, and support for aging in place.

To make the improvements necessary to expand participation and access for Maine people without other
transportation options, funding for public transit
needs to increase. Maine currently spends less than
the national median of $5 per capita.

of Maine’s greenhouse gas emissions. Maine can reduce greenhouse gases by
modernizing our buildings to use cleaner energy, increase energy efficiency,
and utilize lower-carbon building materials.

Building codes to improve energy efficiency, heating and cooling homes and businesses
with heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters, and weatherization are among the most
cost-effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Promoting innovative wood
products will reduce greenhouse emissions while supporting economic development in
Maine’s forest products sector. Implementing appliance standards will further reduce
emissions.
These actions will make Maine’s homes and businesses safer, healthier, more comfortable,
and more affordable. Maine already has incentive programs for efficiency measures such
as heat pumps and weatherization that can be further expanded to achieve our goals.
Low-income households, especially rural low-income households, often pay a higher
percentage of their income to meet their home energy needs. To meet Maine’s climate
and equity goals, weatherization and heat-pump incentive programs should continue to
expand to reach more Maine people, with special efforts to engage diverse communities
and geographies, especially those with the greatest energy cost burdens.

In addition, targeted programs that support weatherization and efficiency in affordable housing — both
existing and new — along with new opportunities for
renewable energy and electric vehicle charging in these
locations will expand future options for residents and
homeowners.

Annual operating costs of heat pumps are lower than
for oil furnaces. Rebates available from Efficiency
Maine can help to reduce upfront costs. To ensure
equity, Maine should target financial incentives to
those who most need the assistance to upgrade their
heating systems.

With assistance from Efficiency Maine Trust incentives, more than 60,000 high-performance heat
pumps and 35,000 heat-pump water heaters have been
installed in Maine in the past several years. These are
nation-leading installation results that will lower emissions and energy bills for Maine people.

Transition to Cleaner
Heating and Cooling Systems,
Efficient Appliances
•

Install at least 100,000 new heat
pumps in Maine by 2025, ensuring that by 2030, 130,000 homes
are using between 1-2 heat
pumps and an additional 115,000
homes are using a whole-home
heat-pump system. Install at
least 15,000 new heat pumps in
income-eligible households by
2025.

Modern high-efficiency wood heating is also an opportunity that supports Maine’s forest products industry and heating with a renewable Maine-grown heat
source, as compared to oil or propane systems.
Figure 9: The Distribution of Heat-Pump
Incentives in Maine.

Implement Maine Appliance
Standards requirements by 2022.

Maine should encourage households, businesses, and
institutions to switch to cleaner heating and cooling
systems. About 60% of Maine households rely on
heating oil as their primary home heating source
— the highest percentage in the country — with an
additional 12% utilizing propane. There is a growing
opportunity in Maine to transition to new technologies for heating that produce lower greenhouse gas
emissions.
New high-performance electric heat pumps have 60%
lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than oil burners.
They are a cost-effective way to reduce emissions while
saving homeowners money. Heat pumps have the added
benefit of providing cooling in the summer months,
which will be even more important as the number of
high-heat days increases due to warming trends caused
by climate change. These products have been shown to
work well, even with Maine’s cold winters, particularly
as technology has continued to improve.

meet our greenhouse gas emissions goals by reducing
energy use and emissions. States can set standards for



products not covered by national standards, which are
set by the U.S. Department of Energy, such as computers, portable air conditioners, and water coolers. Maine
should join with other U.S. states to adopt a consistent set of standards for appliances not yet covered by
national standards. We can accomplish this by partnering with states who have already developed programs
and standards.

The U.S. healthcare sector is responsible for nearly 10%
of all greenhouse gas emissions, and hospitals make up
more than one-third of those emissions. Given the
importance of climate issues and health, public-health
professionals recommended that the state encourage
incentives specifically targeted toward Maine’s healthcare sector, supporting reductions of emissions and
energy costs through efficiency and renewable energy.

and businesses by 2030.

Many of the 550,000 existing homes in Maine are
aging and energy inefficient. More than half of owned
and two-thirds of rented housing units were built in
1960 or earlier. Maine should expand weatherization
programs to reduce emissions and save home and business owners money on their utility bills by improving
insulation and reducing air leakage.
Maine has successfully implemented weatherization
programs to improve the energy efficiency of approximately 20,000 market-rate homes since 2010, and many
thousands more through the low-income programs of
Maine Housing and the Community Action Programs.
These programs should be accelerated and expanded
to include commercial property owners, making
thousands more homes, public buildings, and businesses energy efficient and saving millions in heating and operating costs. Disclosure of energy usage in
commercial buildings will also incentivize continuous
improvements.

Efficiency Maine Trust
Efficiency Maine Trust (EMT or Efficiency Maine) is the independent administrator for programs to
improve the efficiency of energy use and reduce greenhouse gases in Maine. By delivering education,
training, and financial incentives on the purchase of high-efficiency equipment or changes to operations,
EMT helps Maine customers save electricity, natural gas, and other fuels used in the state’s economy.
Funding for EMT programs comes from assessments paid by Maine’s gas and electric utility ratepayers,
revenues from the sale of interstate Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) carbon allowances, the
Forward Capacity Market payments at ISO-New England, settlements (such as the Volkswagen emissions cheating case), and government grants.
EMT’s current residential incentives include rebates for heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters along
with weatherization. Greater incentives are available for low-income households. For businesses, towns,
institutions, and manufacturers, EMT offers larger incentives to reduce the cost of energy-efficiency
projects as well as tailored energy-efficiency and distributed-generation projects that require sitespecific engineering analyses.

HEAT-PUMP TECHNOLOGY FOR
HEATING, COOLING, AND HOT WATER
Modern heat-pump technology can achieve exceptionally efficient heating and cooling powered by
electricity, saving on monthly heating bills and
reducing emissions, when paired with a clean electricity supply. Heat pumps can be used for space
heating in homes and businesses and for domestic
hot-water heating. The combined heating and cooling ability is another advantage of heat pumps over
gas and oil systems. A typical high-performance
heat-pump unit rebated through Efficiency Maine’s
programs can deliver a unit of heat with 60% less
emissions today than an oil-fired furnace or boiler.
As the electric grid converts to renewable energy,
the emissions reductions achieved by transitioning
to electric heat pump will increase. Recent evaluations in Maine and Vermont confirm that high-performance heat pumps, engineered to operate in
cold climates, can effectively deliver heat even
when the outside temperature falls well below 0°F.
Over the life of the product, a heat pump will save
homeowners, on average, from $300 to $600 per
year in operating costs compared with heating-oil
or propane costs.
Heat pumps may be effective for multiple types of
heating and cooling scenarios. The most common
configuration in Maine today is the installation of
a “mini-split” ductless heat pump connected to
one or more indoor heads, and retrofitting one or
more units enables a home to displace a significant
portion of the current heating system and emissions. Other configurations include “whole house”
heat-pump systems, which may use a central heat
pump to distribute heating (and cooling) throughout the entire building using ducts or multiple

mini-split units. A scalable system of ductless heat
pumps can also serve a larger commercial space
like an office building or school.
A high-performance home unit costs between
$2,500 and $5,000 installed, depending on the
model and the complexity of the installation. Efficiency Maine offers rebates of between $500 and
$1,000 per unit for most customers, and up to
$2,000 for lower- and moderate-income customers, with support for LIHEAP customers through
Maine Housing. Incentives are also offered for heat
pumps at businesses and public buildings.
Since Efficiency Maine started promoting heat
pumps in 2013, more than 60,000 high-performance units have been installed across the state.
Despite a pandemic, the program is on pace to
install more than 15,000 units in 2020, showing
ongoing progress toward market transformation.
The supply chain of manufacturers, distributors,
and Maine-based installers has ramped up capacity to meet the growing demand.
A similar story of market transformation is unfolding with water heaters. Last year Efficiency Maine’s
heat-pump water-heater initiatives rebated
roughly 8,500 units, bringing the total installed
over the last several years to 33,000 (including
more than 3,000 installed in low-income households at no cost to the customer). The geographic
distribution of heat pumps and water heaters
is widespread, with the highest percentage of
incentives per home going to northern Aroostook
County.

The state should take a leadership role in reducing
emissions from the buildings sector by requiring best
practices in design and construction, including building materials selection; heating, cooling, and lighting
systems; and enhanced efficiency and weatherization.

An RFS for the heating sector would require that a
certain percentage of heating fuels be lower carbon or
carbon neutral in order to replace or reduce the quantity of fossil heating fuels in residential, commercial,
and industrial sectors. This could encourage the development of renewable fuels and technologies in Maine,
such as biofuels made from wood biomass, biodiesels
from used vegetable oils, and fuels made from anerobic digesters on farms or in other waste environments.
These projects would create jobs in Maine’s rural
communities and reduce both carbon and methane
emissions, while reducing heating and operating costs.
Maine should investigate the options for an RFS for
heating fuels.

“LEAD BY EXAMPLE”
In January 2020, Governor Mills signed an executive order to require Maine state government to
Lead by Example through energy efficiency, renewable energy, and related emissions reductions
and savings, promoting health and sustainability in the workplace and building resilient infrastructure. It requires that state government will strive to equal or exceed Maine emissions-reductions
targets and seek cost efficiencies for taxpayers and that new state facilities will be designed with
greater resilience to new climate conditions.
Maine joins more than 20 states whose initiatives achieve substantial cost savings and demonstrate
energy and environmental leadership. Lead by Example programs raise public awareness of the
ways that clean-energy and energy-efficiency technologies save public funds while reducing emissions, improving air quality, and encouraging markets for cleaner and safer products and services.
The state will prioritize energy and fuel efficiency when upgrading building systems such as lighting
and heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC), install renewable energy and EV charging stations on
state properties, invest in EVs and lower-emissions state fleet vehicles, and encourage telework to
reduce vehicle miles traveled by state employees.
The state will identify opportunities to Lead by Example in the procurement of Maine-sourced and
climate-friendly goods and services, such as carbon-storing mass timber for state construction
projects, biofuels for state vehicles, and locally produced food. The state will also pursue efforts
that lead to healthier workplaces and reduce solid waste from government facilities.
The state will also seek to support similar efforts in local community buildings, including energy-efficiency retrofits and renewable-energy projects on municipal and tribal government properties, and climate-friendly practices and materials for school construction and affordable housing.
Many Maine communities have already led the way with efficiency, renewable energy, and clean
transportation investments.

ectors with high greenhouse gas emissions, such as transportation and heating, must shift their
energy sources from fossil fuels to electricity and low-carbon fuels to achieve Maine’s climate goals.
This makes it even more essential to produce and consume electricity that is increasingly clean
and from lower-emissions resources. This transition must be managed effectively to ensure affordability
and reliability.
Maine is a member of a cooperative effort by 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to limit emissions called
the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). RGGI is the first mandatory, market-based carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions reduction program in the United States, and it is focused on the power-generating sector.
RGGI proceeds in Maine have been used to provide technical assistance and financial incentives to help Maine’s
residents, institutions, businesses, and industries make investments in energy efficiency.
A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) establishes the percentage of electricity that an electricity supplier is
required to provide from renewable resources. To encourage more generation of lower-emissions electricity,
Maine has increased the state RPS to 80% by 2030, with a goal of 100% renewable electricity by 2050. Additionally, pairing energy storage with small distributed and large utility-scale renewable resources provides
opportunities to maximize the value of renewable energy to our electric grid.

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES
Distributed energy resource (DER) generally refers to small-scale electricity generation and controllable loads that are spread out and are connected to the distribution grid system, as opposed to
the larger transmission system, or directly to a building or other host facility. The most common
examples of DERs are residential solar installations, but DERs can also include larger solar installations, wind, small-scale hydro, tidal, and even energy storage. Distributed energy systems can also
support investments in infrastructure that can lead to overall reduced costs (providing savings for
ratepayers and supporting equity goals) and can avoid barriers that often accompany small-scale
renewable energy projects.

In Maine, a distributed generation resource is defined by statute as being fueled by renewable technologies, and programs have recently limited the size to being less than 5 MW in capacity. Additionally, DERs can include demand-response technologies and interactive resources, such as electric
vehicle smart chargers, smart thermostats, and heat-pump water and space heaters. These resources
either provide energy to the electrical grid or allow for greater control of demand for electricity and
are located at various geographic locations across the grid system, sometimes “behind the meter.”

generation.

•

Set achievable targets for costeffective deployment of technologies such as offshore wind,

Maine will need to ensure adequate affordable clean-energy supply to meet our 100% RPS goal and any
increased load through the development of centralized
generating resources, distributed energy resources, and
other measures.

Maine should leverage this development of renewable-energy resources to ensure the highest benefits
for our residents and economy. This will require additional procurements of clean-energy supply and could
be supported through specific development targets for
offshore wind, smaller distributed energy resources,
and energy storage. The state should work with landowners, developers, fishermen, and other important
stakeholders to develop siting guidelines that seek to
minimize impacts to communities, fishing, and the
environment, and avoid significant losses of key farmlands.
Research has demonstrated that renewable energy
sources can provide energy at a cost lower than or

ADVANCES IN RENEWABLE ENERGY IN MAINE
Renewable energy technologies have advanced immensely over the last few decades. These advancements,
along with supportive state and federal policies, have resulted in deployment of competitively-priced
renewable electricity generation. The clean-energy sector in Maine has been experiencing growth, especially following the passage of numerous supportive clean-energy policies in 2019. For example, solar
energy generation — from residential projects to large utility-scale projects — has attracted significant
investment and development interest. In the most recent RPS procurement in 2020 run by the Public
Utilities Commission, solar was the majority of the large-scale generation selected. These projects were
highly cost competitive, with first-year energy prices averaging 3.5 cents per kWh.

As part of the state-initiated Maine Offshore Wind
Initiative, Maine is working to position itself to benefit
from future offshore wind projects, including opportunities for job creation, supply chain and port development, and offshore wind’s impact on the state’s energy
future. To help fund this effort, the U.S. Economic
Development Administration has provided the state
with a $2.2 million grant to develop a comprehensive
roadmap that will build on Maine’s national leadership
on floating offshore wind reflecting the substantial
work and research done in the state and Gulf of Maine.

This roadmap will assess Maine’s competitive advantage on floating offshore wind and the state of associated supply chain, infrastructure, technology, and

residuals and other residual biomass from timber, adding value for the industry while also
reducing waste that could potentially be landfilled, causing additional climate impacts.
Maine should develop and enhance marketing programs for Maine forest products, in
coordination with efforts such as FOR/Maine, focused on products such as mass-timber,
biofuels, bioplastics, nano-cellulosic materials, and wood-based insulation products. State
construction projects should leverage opportunities to use mass timber and encourage

MAINE’S FOREST BIOECONOMY
AND CLIMATE CHANGE
Sustaining and developing new markets for Maine’s forest products is critical to maintaining the working forests
that provide significant benefits to Maine’s climate goals by sequestering carbon.
Low-grade wood harvest is an important sustainable forestry tool, which helps landowners grow better quality
timber. At the same time, sawmills and paper mills produce a lot of chips, dust, and residuals as waste from the
production process. Innovation is driving new market opportunities for these waste wood materials.
Public awareness of global climate change has driven governments, consumers, and manufacturers to recognize that products produced with plant materials (cellulose) from trees and other plant products can be used to
replace those made with petroleum products. As new biomass from trees grows and replaces the plant materials
used to produce these products, it removes carbon from the atmosphere and contributes to carbon neutrality.
Growing worldwide demand for sustainably-produced climate-friendly products is one of the greatest opportunities recognized by the industry-led effort to build a globally competitive forest industry, called FOR/Maine.
A bioeconomy strategy for Maine relies on diversification of our forest economy through the pursuit of the best
and highest use for every part of the tree, resulting in greater environmental and economic resilience and the
reduction and repurposing of waste.
Innovative new products include cross-laminated timber, a building material for multi-story buildings that stores
carbon for the life of the building; the use of wood cellulose in building insulation products as a replacement to
petroleum-dependent fiberglass insulation; biodegradable and recyclable food packaging paper that replaces
single-use plastic; and transportation and heating biofuels derived from woody biomass.

REBUILDING OUR ECONOMY

Tackling Climate with
Shovel-Ready Infrastructure Projects
Investments to prepare our communities and infrastructure for climate-change impacts will create thousands of good-paying jobs in the engineering, design, and construction sectors. Investing in shovel-ready
projects during a time of significant economic hardship can help revitalize Maine’s economy in the short
and long term, while also making our communities and state infrastructure systems more resilient.
Maine should develop a list of climate-related infrastructure projects in early 2021 to utilize for nearterm economic recovery, and track over the long term to identify backlogs. Maine communities and the
state have already identified critical infrastructure projects aimed at adapting to and reducing climatechange impacts. Many of these projects do not have the necessary funding. This includes a backlog of
$325 million in infrastructure projects that local communities have identified to reduce disaster risk.
Much-needed pre-development assistance would help ensure that infrastructure projects are made
shovel-ready for state or federal support including design, engineering, and permitting; grant writing;
and matchmaking with investors for public-private partnerships.

Protecting natural and working lands is critical to
maximize carbon storage, support working farms and
forests, ensure valuable ecosystems remain in place for
future generations, and contribute to Maine’s fight
against the effects of climate change.
Conserving forests and farmland through conservation
easements is one of the more cost-effective strategies
to help reach carbon neutrality by maintaining forest
cover and ensuring the lands will be available for future
forest and farmland ecosystem services. A 2019 report
on land conservation suggested that Maine currently
has approximately 20% conserved lands or about 4
million acres.
A combination of voluntary, focused purchases of
working forest or farm conservation easements and
lands will support robust forest products and agricultural economies, increase carbon storage opportunities,
help food security, conserve biodiversity, and enhance
climate adaptation and resilience for wildlife, people,
and communities.
To that end, Maine should support dedicated
and sustained sources of funding to support the conservation target and to protect natural and working
lands. This should prioritize providing state-matching
funds for the newly-renewed federal Land and Water

Why is it important for farmers to engage in climate issues?
Farmers are on the frontlines of climate change — our livelihoods literally depend on the weather.
As weather becomes less predictable and more severe, it will be increasingly difficult for farmers
to grow the food that sustains us all. As a young farmer, I view climate change as the biggest challenge my business will face in the decades to come. I want to make sure young voices are heard, as
future generations will bear the burden of this crisis. I view climate action as nonnegotiable.
What is your concern for farming’s future with climate change?
The climate crisis threatens farms of all sizes and sectors — from vegetables and specialty crops
to dairy, livestock, and commodities. It will undermine crop yields, supply chains, and food security. Supporting farm businesses and strengthening local and regional
food systems are key to building resilience to the instability and
economic impacts of climate change in our state.
What should farmers know about this plan?
This plan protects farmland from development, promotes
climate-friendly practices in agriculture, and strengthens our local food system — all of which are critical for
farmers and for Maine communities. Not only will this
result in increased carbon sequestration and reduced
emissions, this will ensure that our communities have

coastline is a prime opportunity to create long-term
“blue carbon” storage that requires protection from
development and sea-level rise.
As part of the comprehensive, statewide carbon inventory conducted by DEP, in partnership with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, Maine should determine where and how much blue carbon can be stored
by conducting a coastwide survey of coastal environments like salt marshes, seaweeds, and seagrass beds.
We should explore innovative solutions like opportunities for seaweed aquaculture to enhance long-term

As it grows, kelp draws carbon out of ocean water, creating a “halo effect” that can help improve nearby water quality. Scientific researchers, like those shown here
from the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, and aquaculture businesses in Maine are now partnering to
experiment with growing kelp alongside shellfish growing operations to naturally improve water quality and
reduce local acidification.

s Maine reduces greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, we must also
respond to climate impacts occurring now and expected soon. State support for
communities to be proactive about understanding, planning, and acting to reduce
their risk from climate change is essential.
This support should focus on areas like emergency management, economic development, public
health, transportation systems, energy systems, and infrastructure. The state should promote
regional collaboration among towns and offer technical assistance, funding, updated land-use
planning, as well as expanded public-health efforts.

Enhanced coordination of assistance and funding for community resilience will require meeting the
needs of Maine’s diverse communities, including small towns, large cities, and coastal and inland
communities. This includes making consistent and actionable climate data, tools, and guidance
accessible; guiding and incentivizing towns toward activities that enhance community resilience;
and funding the planning, implementation, and performance evaluation of resilience activities.
An important component of this assistance is the expansion of guidance products that help communities evaluate climate risk, understand their options, and prioritize actions. This includes case studies, best practices and lessons learned, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities.
Maine should ensure that the lowest capacity and most vulnerable communities are able to participate; the Equity Assessment also advises meaningfully engaging a broad number of stakeholders
into planning processes to ensure a variety of perspectives inform climate planning, and to ensure
equitable outreach to populations at risk from climate impacts, particularly emergency situations.

Karina Graeter and Abbie Sherwin are on the front lines of climate resiliency with
the Southern Maine Planning and Development Commission in coastal York County, where
rising sea levels portend serious economic and environmental damage. As Sustainability
Coordinator and Senior Planner & Coastal Resilience Coordinator, respectively, they work
collaboratively with several coastal towns on resiliency strategies, a regional approach
the Climate Action Plan endorses as a model for other communities to consider.

What inspires you to do this work?
Southern Maine municipalities are on the front lines of climate change, and we’re inspired by their
enthusiasm to work together in a true regional effort to address climate issues and impacts. In a
home-rule state like Maine, there is so much opportunity for communities to test creative and novel
approaches to tackle climate challenges, be leaders on climate action, and help protect the places,
natural resources, and way of life so valued by our communities for future generations.
What do you think is the biggest obstacle to your work? Or the biggest opportunity?
For our communities, the biggest obstacle to mitigating and adapting to climate change is the lack
of capacity, guidance, and support. A regional strategy like ours is the biggest opportunity for
addressing these needs. By helping the towns communicate and work together on climate change
initiatives, we can leverage peer learning to share knowledge and experiences, and we can pool
resources for regional initiatives that have a broader impact.
This sort of regional collaboration is just one piece of the puzzle for understanding and addressing
local climate impacts. The Climate Action Plan will help to address some obstacles and information
needs, but substantive work on climate change and mobilization of the Climate Action Plan will
require coordinated and comprehensive action across all levels of government in Maine.
What would you like the governor or legislature to consider when they read this Climate Action Plan?
When reading the Climate Action Plan, we would like our state decisionmakers to keep in mind that
our municipalities enthusiastically support the State’s efforts to address climate change, and they
are eager to play key roles in meaningful climate action. To do that, municipalities need useful and
usable information, technical resources, direct assistance, and financial support for understanding
and addressing the impacts of climate change.

Empower Local and Regional
Community Resilience Efforts
•

Provide state leadership for robust
technical assistance and funding to
communities by 2024 to support
local and regional climate-resilience initiatives.

Maine communities are coping with a variety of difficult and threatening challenges. Some are climate
related while others like COVID-19 are not. To thrive
within continuous change and multiple overlapping
crises, communities must become proactive in understanding their risks, planning, and taking actions to
safeguard their citizens.
“Resilience” will have different meanings to different
communities, but generally the foundation of community resilience includes: 1) planning and decision-making processes that absorb information about climate
and health risks and evaluate options for action; 2) individuals, committees, or offices in municipal and tribal
governments who are responsible for planning, implementing, and monitoring the activities that reduce
climate risk, improve health, and build the community’s capacity to manage crises; and 3) community
dialogue and participation that ensures the voices and
needs of the most vulnerable citizens are elevated and
prioritized.
Progress on these foundations can also help communities become better prepared to manage unexpected
challenges like pandemics and economic crises.
State government’s current capacity to provide aid and
financial support to towns is significantly undersized
compared to the need and falling particularly short in
inland towns. Lack of capacity, expertise, and funding
are consistently cited by municipalities as reasons why
they are not able to address their climate risks. Only

11% of communities in Maine have a town planner on
staff, while 72% have no local planner and insufficient
or no regional planning support.
On page 86, the left-hand map shows the limited planning capacity of many Maine municipalities. The map
on the right highlights those that have both limited
capacity and higher social vulnerability to climate
impacts based on factors such as socioeconomic status,
minority status, household composition and disability,
and housing and transportation.
The state should establish cabinet-level leadership (for
example, a state resilience officer) and coordination
across state agencies and with nonprofits, university
experts, and other partners.
Expanded state assistance should include a clearinghouse for climate information, best practices, case studies, and funding resources to help towns understand
climate risk, evaluate options, and prioritize actions.
Increased funds should be available to incentivize
regional resilience planning and cooperation and the
inclusion of climate resilience in local and regional
plans, regulations, and capital-investment plans. In
addition to building state government’s capacity to
support communities and improving interagency coordination, regional approaches to planning and pooling
resources are also cost-effective ways to build capacity. The state should encourage and support coordination among regional organizations, nonprofits, and
the private-sector efforts, many of which are already
providing important services and planning capacity
for communities.

Official projections for sea-level rise will give agencies,
municipalities, tribal governments, and the private
sector clear guidance for waterfront planning, development, risk reduction, and conservation. The guidance includes projections for 2050 and 2100 of the
intermediate and high scenarios for sea-level rise.
While the intermediate scenarios may be useful
for most planning activities, the high scenarios are
important for decisions about long-lifespan infrastructure and facilities that are critical for public
safety and local economies.

The Maine Climate Council recommends

Emphasize Resilience
Through Land-Use Planning
and Legal Tools
•

Develop and implement updated
land-use regulations, laws, and
practices by 2024 in order to
enhance community resilience to
flooding and other climate impacts.

An update of land-use laws and practices will give
communities the tools they need to build resilience,
enhance ecosystem services, and get out of harm’s way.
Maine is a home-rule state, which in a climate context
means that local governments have the authority and
responsibility for planning and implementing most
activities for community resilience. In Maine’s unorganized territories, the state’s Land Use Planning
Commission serves the planning function.
The tools communities currently use — including
comprehensive planning, zoning, site location of

development, and stormwater and floodplain management practices — were not designed with climate
change in mind. They need be updated to:
•

Consider climate hazards like
sea-level rise

•

Leverage nature-based solutions

•

Contain more consistent and
scientifically-sound definitions

•

Provide more utility to communities
for building climate resilience

•

Support development and economic
activity in areas less vulnerable to
climate impacts.

The state should lead a process to update Maine’s landuse laws, tools, and practices to address the threats
communities face from climate-change impacts. The
update process must include significant stakeholder
participation, especially from vulnerable communities. The rollout of updates must be coordinated with
technical assistance, training for planners and code-enforcement officers, and incentives.

PREV ENTION

Robust monitoring of public-health impacts from

particulate matter, and ozone; monitor for water-borne
diseases, harmful algal blooms, and emerging threats
in large lakes and public water supplies; monitor for
vector-borne diseases from ticks and mosquitoes; and

Nearly half of Maine people are served by public water
systems that rely on surface water bodies like lakes and
rivers as the source of drinking water. Every $1 spent on
source water protection saves $27 in future water-treatment costs, so there is an enormous financial advantage
to taking proactive actions that prevent contamination.

“Like COVID-19, climate change most affects people who
already have low health equity to begin with — those
who, for a number of reasons, don’t have opportunities
to be healthier. Indeed, it’s these health inequities that
place individuals and communities at the greatest risk
for the harmful effects of climate change.”

Clean water is important for public health and economic development. To safeguard public health against
water-related climate hazards, Maine should protect drinking water sources and downstream water bodies by:
supporting activities that protect watersheds that supply drinking water; encouraging best management practices and low-impact development; separating storm- and sewer-collection systems to prevent future sewage
discharges into bays, estuaries, and rivers where contact with humans or shellfish is likely; and identify public
water systems in danger of contamination by flood inundation due to climate change.

By 2024, Maine will have convened stakeholder processes
to make specific recommendations for changes in state regulations
on the following land-use issues.
Land use emerged as an important issue throughout the Climate Planning Process. Maine needs to meet
both the imperative to reduce carbon emissions and the duty to protect people and infrastructure from
harm. In addition to addressing sea-level rise, there are several topics in the Maine Climate Action Plan
that require continued stakeholder processes to address. They include:

•

CLEAN-ENERGY SITING: Maine should continue to work to achieve its ambitious renewable energy
goals while balancing protection of our natural resources, seeking siting that has the least impact
on prime agriculture lands, and fishing and marine industries.

•

LAND-USE PRACTICES: Maine should encourage and incentivize climate-friendly local land-use
policies that promote convenient, walkable, and bikeable communities and reduce the need for driving and commuting. Complete streets, mixed use, and housing density in downtowns and village
areas are potential considerations for reducing vehicle miles traveled.

•

COMMUNITY FLOOD-RISK REDUCTION: Maine should develop guidance to support flood risk
reductions for communities and state infrastructure. Long-term planning for sea-level rise and
riverine flooding should help equitably locate or relocate development in safer areas.

•

ANTICIPATING GROWTH: Maine should anticipate the potential for growth, development, and
economic opportunity as people migrate to Maine seeking refuge from severe climate impacts
affecting other parts of the country.

aine must improve the climate readiness and resilience of infrastructure so that
it serves Maine better under day-to-day conditions and functions reliably during
emergencies.

Functioning infrastructure is a basic requirement for public safety and health, thriving state
and local economies, and the flow of people, goods, and information. Much of Maine’s infrastructure was constructed well before climate change was understood as a threat. It is no
surprise, then, that climate change is already having a negative impact on our roadways and
bridges, shoreside businesses and working waterfronts, water-treatment facilities, and utilities.
Aging infrastructure represents both a burden on the state as well as an opportunity. Investing in climate-ready infrastructure increases day-to-day functional capacity and, during an
emergency, improves performance and survivability of the asset or network.

For 25 years, the National Institute of Building Sciences has reported that every $1 invested
in pre-disaster risk reduction results in $6 of avoided disaster damages. With the increasing
pace of devastating and expensive disasters, the current disaster-rebuild cycle is increasingly
unsustainable. An improved model for investing in resilient infrastructure is needed.
Maine should continue to promote pre-disaster risk reduction. New and upgraded infrastructure must be designed to withstand the conditions expected over a decades-long lifetime.
Otherwise, any modest cost savings today are purchased at the expense of much higher repair
and replacement costs in the future, not to mention the public safety, health, and economic
losses incurred when infrastructure fails.

M AT T LU TKUS
Matt Lutkus is Town Manager in Damariscotta. The town is taking action to protect its historic
downtown from rising sea levels with a comprehensive waterfront infrastructure project to guard
against flooding, replace sewer lines, improve drainage and pedestrian access, and build new
public restrooms. This work was funded by a $3 million federal grant and $1.3 million in funds
raised locally after being planned for a decade — a timeline the Climate Action Plan wants to
accelerate for towns through a State Infrastructure Adaptation Fund.
Was there a “lightbulb moment” for you regarding climate impacts?
In early 2012, the Board of Selectmen first viewed inundation scenarios prepared by the Lincoln
County Regional Planning Commission, which identified our downtown village as one of the areas
in Lincoln County most vulnerable to coastal flooding.
For years, the downtown parking lot flooded several times a year, but except when first-floor businesses were flooded, it was viewed as a nuisance the community always dealt with. The inundation
scenarios, however, showed that flooding was going to get worse — and soon. This got everyone’s
attention, and shortly after flood resilience was made a top planning priority.
What should towns do to start preparing for climate change?
Use federal, state, and regional data to educate the public on the effects of climate change in their
community. Then, work to build a consensus on an action plan. Beyond the first steps, planning,
engineering, designing, and having projects “shovel ready” pays off. When construction dollars do
become available at the Federal and State levels, decision-makers want to see results within a few
years versus a decade. Other than that, I recommend patience and perseverance. Try never to miss
an opportunity to tell your story to whomever will listen.
What should the governor or legislature consider for towns when they read this report?
Officials from various State agencies have been extremely helpful to us in our flood resiliency
planning activities, and more generally in the Town’s efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
Currently, the electric energy for all of the municipal facilities is derived from a solar array, we are
in the process of converting all of our street lights to LED, and we are installing a two-unit electric
vehicle charging station in our parking lot. I encourage the governor and legislature to continue to
encourage these and similar efforts in municipalities and in the private sector.

Maine’s municipalities, tribal governments, and state
agencies all struggle to fund infrastructure projects.
Maine currently has a backlog of 1,798 infrastructure-adaptation projects listed across all 16 counties at
a proposed cost of $325 million. These projects reduce a
community’s vulnerability to climate impacts and can
also reduce costs to respond and recover when there is
a disaster. While there are significant federal resources
available, federal grant programs generally require
cost-share or “matching” funds from state or local
governments.

It is important to invest up front to reduce vulnerability and avoid post-disaster expenses. However,
there will continue to be a need for the state and local
cost-share dollars necessary to leverage federal disaster-relief funds. Having state emergency funds at the
ready allows us to access federal funds more quickly,
supporting local recovery and helping to prevent disaster impacts from reinforcing economic disparity.

aine’s Climate Action Plan is a blueprint for bold, specific, and immediate
action. To implement the plan, government leaders must not only recognize their responsibility in this moment, but also move with urgency to
achieve its outcomes. Resources will be needed do this, as will clear and transparent
metrics to ensure accountability to the public and convey where progress is occurring.
The responsibility for appropriation and revenues rests with the Governor and Maine
State Legislature, with similar processes at the municipal, tribal, regional, and federal
levels. This plan seeks to provide a roadmap for actions that will meet the state’s goals,
urging leaders at all levels of government and society to consider how to prioritize
investments toward these actions.
Yet fighting climate change cannot be shouldered by government alone. For this plan
to be successful, the support and engagement of Maine people is critical — to mobilize
a broad coalition of state, local, regional, and tribal governments, nonprofits, academic
institutions, and private interests taking collaborative, decisive action.
Significant and sustained investments, well-financed programs, and properly-capitalized lending entities are needed to implement the Climate Action Plan. Such investments and partnerships will be needed to realize outcomes like a modern electricity
grid that delivers clean energy needed to power climate-friendly innovations; transportation infrastructure resilient against rising sea levels and more frequent, intense
storms; and enhanced incentive programs that make cleaner vehicles and energy-efficiency improvements within reach of everyone in Maine.

in climate-focused projects and initiatives.
This four-year Climate Action Plan, however, is emerging amid unprecedented conditions caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic, which is stretching state revenues
and many family budgets without relief in sight, and further exposing inherent inequities within our economy that puts Maine’s most vulnerable citizens at risk from
even minor disruptions.
This grave situation illustrates the urgent need to prepare our people, communities,
and economy for the disruptions that climate change will cause. Investments to create
a sustainable economy that is less reliant on global supply chains and imported fossil
fuels, while leveraging Maine’s abundance to source essential goods, from fresh food
to building supplies, will reinforce the bedrock of Maine’s economy and enable families to withstand major challenges in the future.

FUNDING & FINA NCING OPTIONS
NEAR TERM
USE GENERAL-FUND BONDS FOR ESSENTIAL, FOCUSED CAPITAL INVESTMENT:
Maine should leverage record-low borrowing rates to support critical infrastructure projects that will generate
economic activity, create jobs for Maine people, and signal bold action for addressing climate change and implementing this plan. Specific bonding priorities should include:
State infrastructure adaptation fund: Establish this fund to support local and state projects, such as

modern transportation investments, urgently needed broadband deployments, and overdue wastewater and
drinking-water projects to address risks from climate impacts, while also leveraging federal matching funds to
unlock further federal grant support.
Energy innovation, weatherization, and clean transportation: Expand and enhance state

research and development programs; recapitalize incentive programs that generate jobs and savings for families,
businesses, and communities.
Natural and working lands: Invest to protect at-risk working lands and support business growth of natu-

ral-resource-based businesses.
Clean-energy workforce: Support targeted career training programs like CTEs and those within Maine’s

community colleges and university system to ready Maine people for new and growing well-paying employment
opportunities.
Pursue current and new federal grant opportunities: Maine should aggressively support energy,

infrastructure, and climate strategies through new federal Land and Water Conservation Funds, emerging
climate-focused state funds, federal FEMA hazard-mitigation grants, and ongoing federal transportation, environmental infrastructure, and energy programs. The state should also prioritize providing match dollars when
significant federal investments are available.
Maximize one-time funding streams and settlement dollars: These funds, like those received

from the Volkswagen emissions settlement, may continue to flow into the state from renewable energy and
power projects and should be deployed aggressively to support emissions-mitigation actions.
Enact a Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) program: This financing mech-

anism would support investments by Maine businesses into clean energy and energy-efficiency improvements.
Deploy and retool of existing state resources, staff, and grant programs: The state should

review and revise existing state programs and grants to align with climate mitigation and adaptation goals, such
as the state drinking-water revolving fund, Tax-Increment Finance programs, or other municipal infrastructure
grant and loans programs.
Seek stable budget support for long-term actions: At the time of this report’s publication, Maine’s

general fund budget is under significant strain from revenue reductions associated with the recession and
pandemic. But as Maine recovers, state leaders should allocate funding for programs that require ongoing
support, such as technical assistance, tax credits and incentives, and monitoring.
A Fou r-Ye a r Pl a n for C l i m a t e A c t ion

103



Convene: State leaders, stakeholders, and finance experts should convene in 2021 to consider additional

creative funding and finance solutions to support Maine’s climate strategies, and they should work
collaboratively with Maine’s federal delegation and federal agencies around emerging climate funding
opportunities.

LONG TER M
IDENTIFY REVENUE SOURCES FOR LONG-TERM FUNDING FOR:
Essential transportation infrastructure and clean transportation: Maine needs to fund basic

transportation infrastructure needs, including the adaptation work required to make Maine’s transportation systems and emergency evacuation routes able to withstand increasing storm events and rising sea levels.
In addition, clean transportation programs will also require sustained support for electric vehicles (EVs) and
clean-car rebates, public charging infrastructure, pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, broadband expansion,
and clean public transportation options, including buses, school buses, and ferries.
State Infrastructure Adaptation Fund and disaster funds: The proposed State Infrastructure

Adaptation Fund supports long-term infrastructure needs for cities and towns, regional units, and state agencies by meeting cost-share requirements to unlock federal funding for infrastructure projects and pre-disaster funds. Pre-development assistance is also much needed to ensure infrastructure projects are made shovel-ready for federal support or private investment. Maine also has two funds that typically support disaster
recovery including the State Disaster Recovery Fund and a State Contingency Account. Maine should ensure
that they are funded to provide match to towns for federal disaster relief.
Funding for natural and working lands conservation and easements: The Natural and

Working Lands Working Group identified the need for a dedicated, sustained funding source, driven by
the state’s ambitious targets and sequestration needs to support conservation and easements purchases; and
supporting agricultural, forestry, fishing, and recreation access and opportunities. Securing Maine’s natural
lands preserves an essential economic asset and protects the state’s special natural places.
Coordinated climate-change monitoring: Maine will need to identify a combination of federal,

state, foundation, and private funding sources in order to support a comprehensive climate-change data and
monitoring system. Consistent funding over time will help detect changes to land, coastal, and marine ecosystems, avoid data gaps, and support improved and adaptive local decision making.
Enhance supports from visitors: The state should consider funding opportunities that support infra-

structure, investments, and natural lands investments drawn from Maine’s millions of annual visitors who
utilize our transportation systems and contribute emissions in order to experience our iconic landscapes and
clean environment.
Revenue bonding: Long-term capital support for long-term state climate infrastructure projects could

also be identified through revenue-bonding activities for state and local needs.
Innovation funding: Provide funding that supports innovations, from new vehicle batteries that offer

more cost-effective transportation solutions to advances in building material and heating technology. Some
of these innovations can grow and emerge in Maine. The state should invest in the most promising sectors
104

M A IN E WON’T WA IT



with targeted research and development, commercialization, and business-attraction support. Potential highvalue forest products like cross-laminated timber, wood-fiber insulation, biofuels, agriculture production and
innovation, and floating offshore wind could help Maine emerge a national leader in climate and energy innovation. A complementary policy framework, ongoing state and federal investments in innovation and workforce, and stable business program supports should be bolstered to encourage their growth as highlighted in
the Clean Energy Economy Plan.

FINANCING AND POLICY OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION:
Maine green bank or green fund: A green bank or fund could leverage significant, low-cost

private-sector capital to finance clean-energy projects, climate initiatives, and infrastructure over the long
term, based on the successful experience of other states. Options to establish a green bank or fund could
include launching a new program through an existing state finance entity or creating a new fund, both of
which would require capitalization and staff expertise.
Power-sector transformation: This plan proposes a significant process to investigate structural

approaches and make recommendations on required transitions needed for our electricity generation and
delivery system to meet projected electrification demands, stable and affordable prices, and reduced infrastructure costs. Some options considered by the Energy Working Group included public financing mechanisms for additional grid or generation capacity; consumer ownership of all or part of Maine’s power delivery
systems; and examining the viability of a “Maine Power Authority” existing as the primary energy planning
and financing authority in the state.
Carbon-market programs: Working groups recommended ongoing consideration of multistate or

national carbon-market programs. Carbon pricing is generally viewed by economists as needed to address
climate change, but many also consider that these policies are best implemented at the federal level. Maine
already prices power-sector carbon emissions through its participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative and returns the revenues back to participating states and consumers to invest in energy efficiency.
The Transportation Working Group recommended that Maine continue to monitor the Transportation
Climate Initiative, a proposed regional initiative in the Northeast to implement a cap, trade, and invest
system to reduce transportation emissions and generate revenue for transportation transitions, as well as other
options, as transportation-funding solutions.

MEASURING PROGRESS
Clear metrics for Maine’s climate goals are critical for informing the public about whether policies are having
the intended outcomes and for making evidence-based adjustments, enhancements, or replacements to policies
in pursuit of our 2030, 2045, and 2050 targets.
Actions Taken: These indicators will help Maine evaluate progress toward climate mitigation and adap-

tation goals, such as the number of heat pumps installed or green-industry jobs created, as measures of effort
and effectiveness.

Measuring Equity: In addition to these measures, the Maine Climate Council Equity Subcommittee will

recommend targeted goals and program metrics for key populations and groups, providing additional key equity
outcome indicators, along with program suggestions, for Council consideration by September 2021.
The Implementation Chart for the Four-Year Climate Action Plan (available at www.maine.gov/future/initiatives/climate/climate-council) identifies the lead agencies assigned to each of the specific outcomes assigned to the
climate strategies. The agencies will work with partner organizations to implement the actions, and progress will
be monitored quarterly by the Maine Climate Council and working groups.
Emissions and adaptation impacts achieved: These are indicators that evaluate our collective efforts,

as exemplified by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection’s Biennial Emissions Report: “Progress
Toward Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals,” which charts Maine’s sector-based emissions.
New emissions reductions and carbon-neutrality goals outlined in Maine law require the state to include both gross
emissions from all sources, including from the combustion of biomass, as well as a carbon sequestration estimate,
in the biennial greenhouse gas report submitted to the Legislature, starting in January 2022.
The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is also required by law to adopt rules to track and
report annual gross and net greenhouse gas emissions by July 2021. The DEP is also developing the methodology
for calculating net emissions, in consultation with the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, and will be working
with stakeholders in early 2021 to develop a proposed rule for adoption by the Board of Environmental Protection.
Other examples of possible measures include changes in ocean acidification or reductions in heat-related emergency room visits. Because of the global nature of climate change, some of these indicators are only available on a
planetary scale, like atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, and may respond slowly to the actions that state
and country jurisdictions take collectively.

Connect With the Council
On June 26, 2019, Governor Mills signed legislation to create the Maine Climate
Council, an assembly of scientists, industry leaders, bipartisan local and state
officials, and engaged citizens to develop this four-year Climate Action Plan.
Following the release of this Plan, the Maine Climate Council will continue to
meet at least quarterly to track the plan’s implementation and progress. Council
working groups and subcommittees will also continue to meet to review the latest
science, data, and program developments. The Council is charged with creating
a revised Climate Action Plan every four years, going forward.
The Council welcomes public comments and questions. To contact the Council,
invite the Council to speak to your group, organization or class, sign up for the
Council email list, or find out where to follow the Council on social media, please
visit climatecouncil.maine.gov.
Climate actions that meet the urgency of the challenge facing us will take all of
us, doing what we can, to make a difference. Join us!

Adaptation: An adjustment by nature or a community that reduces the hazardous effects of climate change
Biodiesel: A form of diesel fuel derived from plants or animals
Biofuel: Fuel that is derived from biomass such as plant or algae material, wood, or animal waste
Biomass: Generally in this report, we refer to biomass in relation to wood biomass which is any timber-de-

rived product (softwood or hardwood) capable of being converted to energy through direct combustion or
gasification; to solid fuel through pelletizing; or to liquid fuel through myriad processes. Biomass can also be
renewable organic material that comes from plants and animals.
Blue Carbon: Carbon that is buried or sequestered away from the atmosphere by coastal ecosystems like

salt marshes, seaweeds, and seagrass beds
Carbon Neutral: Emissions are balanced by the uptake of carbon dioxide by forests and other ecosystems
Clean Energy: The production of electricity or heat from renewable or low-carbon resources such as solar,

wind, water, biomass, or geothermal. Energy-efficiency measures that improve the output of or reduce energy
consumption, and innovative grid technologies such as energy storage, may also be included in the broad definition of clean energy.
CHP: Combined heat and power
Climate: The average weather conditions at a given place over a period of time. For example, meteorologists

often make comparisons against a 30-year period, called a climate normal.
Climate Change: A difference in the climate over multiple decades or longer. Long-term changes/shifts in

climate can result from both natural and human factors.
DEP: Maine Department of Environmental Protection
DER: Distributed energy resource. Small-scale resources that produce and supply electricity, or controlla-

ble loads, that are connected to a local distribution system or installed at a host facility, and may be spread
out over a wide area. These resources either provide energy to the electrical grid or allow for greater control
of demand for electricity, and are located at various geographic locations across the grid system, sometimes
“behind the meter.”
EEE: Eastern equine encephalitis is a rare but dangerous infection spread by mosquitoes
EPA: Environmental Protection Agency

“Maine cannot wait to make the most of this
extraordinary moment in time. This plan
against climate change comes in the midst of
an unprecedented pandemic which has caused
significant economic and social turmoil in
Maine, across the country, and around the
globe.
“It might be easier to put off climate action
until calmer times. But Maine can’t wait.
Maine shouldn’t wait. And Maine won’t wait.”
—Governor Janet T. Mills
