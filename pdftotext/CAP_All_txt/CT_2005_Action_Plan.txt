EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In accordance with the provisions of Public Act 04­252 (AAC Climate Change), the
Governor’s Steering Committee on Climate Change (GSC) has successfully completed
development of a Connecticut Climate Change Action Plan 2005. This plan represents a
major milestone in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieve the
regional goals set by the New England Governors/Eastern Canadian Premiers
(NEG/ECP).
In creating this plan, the GSC relied to a large extent on the ideas and input it received
from a stakeholder process that consisted of a diverse group of entities representing
government, industry, nongovernmental organizations, academia and the public.
Together, these dedicated stakeholders participated in a yearlong process of identifying
measures to address climate change in Connecticut. During their extensive deliberation
process, each proposed measure was discussed, researched, analyzed and debated until
participants reached consensus. At the end of this stakeholder process, in January 2004,
they delivered a report to the GSC. This report, entitled, Connecticut Climate Change
Stakeholder Dialogue: Recommendations to the Governor’s Steering Committee
(Stakeholders Report), became the starting point for this action plan.
The completion of this comprehensive plan is a major accomplishment. Yet GSC
members recognize, as they have from the outset, that it does not represent an end in
itself. Instead, the plan must be used as a firm foundation for future efforts. Such future
efforts, including progress on the implementation of this plan and new initiatives, can be
tracked through www.ctclimatechange.com. This web site is updated regularly to provide
the most recent information on Connecticut’s climate change initiatives.
The GSC’s primary objective in developing this action plan was to create a document that
could be used to inform policy­makers, implementing agencies, organizations,
institutions and the public. This broad and deep approach achieves several
complementary objectives:
§
§
§

It addresses budgetary concerns about new programs and ideas;
It integrates planning elements for federal and state mandates to assure state
commitments are completed; and
It establishes solid links among state agencies under a working structure that
provides for staff flexibility on projects and overall steering by agency heads.

Completing this plan required not only an update on progress achieved, but a strong focus
on metrics and accountability by staff and agency heads. The GSC employed advanced

2



technical analysis methods to evaluate proposed policy actions for reducing GHG
emissions, including:
§ Calculation of the GHG benefits and costs;
§ Determination of additional benefits and costs;
§ Quantification of any additional benefits and costs using existing and newly
developed analytical measures; and
§ Assessment of the total GHG reductions to determine if the regional GHG targets
agreed upon by the NEG/ECP were being met or exceeded.
Using a new desktop modeling tool developed under the direction of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, three of the 55 recommended actions or RA’s (RA2:
GHG Feebate Program and RA32 and RA33: Creating Heating Oil and Natural Gas
Conservation Funds) were analyzed extensively to identify local economic effects and
ancillary or co­benefits (e.g., health impacts and economy­wide benefits). As the first
state to utilize this new tool, Connecticut was able to identify benefits previously not
quantified. For example, the state’s energy efficiency program, overseen by the Energy
Conservation Management Board, was known to achieve a $3 to $1 direct return on
investment based on electricity savings. By using the new EPA tool, an additional $4 to
$1 payback in terms of reduced health costs and public health benefits was identified as a
result of reductions in criteria air pollutants.
This in­depth analysis enabled the committee to dispel perceptions that the proposed
actions would compete with other core priorities and to craft a comprehensive legislative
agenda that would meet or exceed the GHG reduction targets. In 2004, the following
bills and executive orders were passed:
§
§
§
§

§
§

P.A. 04­84 An Act Concerning Clean Cars – California emissions standards
adopted
P.A. 04­231 An Act Concerning Clean and Alternative Fuel Vehicles – Promotes
hybrids through tax incentives
P.A. 04­85 An Act Concerning Energy Efficiency – Sets efficiency standards for
products and appliances
P.A. 04­252 An Act Concerning Climate Change – Requires mandatory
reporting of GHG emissions, creation of registry, ongoing planning and
implementation action plan effort, development of environmentally preferable
purchasing for state goods and services
P.A. 04­222 An Act Concerning Preservation of the Family Farm and Long Island
Sound – Promotes the purchase of Connecticut­grown foods by the state and
creates “Connecticut Farm Fresh” program
Governor’s Executive Order No. 32 – Requires the state to purchase renewable
energy in increasing amounts, leading to 100% clean energy by 2050.

While other states have begun to take similar steps to reduce GHG emissions,
Connecticut is the first state to address climate change in such a significant and
comprehensive manner. The plan contains 55 recommended actions that focus on five
main topic areas: 1) transportation and land use; 2) residential, commercial and

3



industrial; 4) agriculture, forestry and waste; 4) electricity generation; and 5)
education and outreach. These topic areas were selected in order to broadly address
climate change from all sectors and achieve the greatest outcome. Recommendations will
require administrative and legislative actions, voluntary and mandatory measures, and
state and regional actions.
Thirty­eight recommendations have been designated by the Governor’s Steering
Committee and the governor for immediate implementation, and are noted as such in this
summary. Examples of recommended actions include:
·

Transportation: Raising emission standards for new cars; reducing black carbon
from diesel engines through the use of low sulfur diesel, engine improvements and
tailpipe controls; investing in a hydrogen infrastructure and R&D program.

·

Residential, Commercial, Industrial: Upgrading building codes and using energy
efficient materials and design concepts in the construction of new state buildings and
schools (LEED standard); promoting the purchase of environmentally preferable
products and services by state agencies; testing biodiesel for heating.

·

Agriculture, Forestry, Waste: Adopting actions to increase recycling and source
reductions to 40%; encouraging consumers to buy local produce; supporting landfill­
gas­to­energy projects.

·

Electricity: Increasing the amount of renewable energy supplied to the electricity
grid; implementing a program for Connecticut ratepayers to choose to purchase
electricity derived from clean energy; state government purchase of clean energy.

·

Education: Increasing awareness among the general public, policy­makers,
community leaders, and others of climate change issues and solutions; integrating into
curricula and outreach programming.

These 38 measures result in projected reductions of 3.64 million metric tons carbon
dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) in 2010 and 6.88 MMTCO2e in 2020. It is estimated
that reductions of 5.74 MMTCO2e in 2010 and 17.99 MMTCO2e in 2020 are needed to
meet the statutory goals. Thus, only 63.4 percent of the 2010 statutory goal and 38.2
percent of the 2020 statutory goal are achieved in 2020 by just the 38 measures.
Given these results, it is clear that reductions from the remaining 17 measures are crucial
for Connecticut to meet its reductions targets. The 17 measures result in additional
projected reductions of 5.02 MMTCO2e in 2010 (87.4 percent of goal) and 12.44
MMTCO2e in 2020 (69.2 percent of goal).
The remaining 17 items are undergoing further analysis, including the identification of
appropriate implementation pathways for follow up in 2005 and beyond. Aggressive
implementation of the 38 measures already underway, combined with the start up of new
recommended actions in 2005, will ensure Connecticut’s success in meeting the reduction

4



goals identified by the NEG/ECP and reflected in state law: to reduce its GHG emissions
to 1990 levels by 2010 and to 10 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, eventually reaching
the long­term reduction goal of 75 percent.
Implementation of this comprehensive plan represents a significant and on­going
challenge. To successfully meet this challenge, the GSC began to reach out during the
drafting process to establish working relationships with groups whose active support
would be needed to achieve its goals. These key groups included not only environmental
and business advocates, but colleges and universities, faith­based groups and
municipalities. In addition, working committees at both the agency head and staff level
were established to develop, implement and track progress on each recommended action.
These working groups have been and will continue to be invaluable as we move toward
implementation of additional recommendations.
Through the successful implementation of this plan, Connecticut has an opportunity to
provide state residents a healthier environment, a more stable climate and a stronger
economy.

PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING STATUTORY (NEG/ECP) TARGETS
When the Connecticut Climate Change Stakeholder Dialogue was released in January
2004, the projected GHG emission reductions were not on target to meet the NEG/ECP
goals of 1990 emission levels by 2010 and 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. Based on
the Recommended Actions quantified for the Stakeholder Dialogue, it appeared that
Connecticut was on a path to achieve 70.9% of the necessary reductions in 2010 and
71.3% of the necessary reductions in 2020.
New analyses conducted in 2004 now show that Connecticut can be on a path to meet and
exceed the NEG/ECP targets (see graph below). These analyses were based on new
information, realistic assumptions and correction of prior analyses and resulted in total
net gains of 4.59 MMTCO2e of reductions in 2010 and 6.50 MMTCO2e in 2020.

Summary of Connecticut Climate Change Recommendations

Status
Transportation and Land Use

1. California LEV II Standards
The California Low Emission Vehicle II (LEV II) program
establishes strict emission standards for all new cars sold
in California as well as for any other state that adopts the
program. These standards address non­methane organic
gas (NMOG), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and carbon
monoxide (CO).

Progress ­ Implemented
DEP adopted regulations in December 2004 that
require compliant vehicles commencing with the
2008 model year.
Expected Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reduction
·
2010 = 0.04 MMTCO2e
·
2020 = 0.47 MMTCO2e
Expected Cost per Ton GHG
Baseline LEV II vehicles are currently being sold at
the same price as their non­LEV II certified
counterparts, and manufacturers’ costs for
compliance are less than $100 per vehicle. A
consumer premium of approximately $3,000 currently
exists for hybrid vehicles. California Air Resources
Board (CARB) has estimated the following
incremental costs for advanced technology partial
zero­emission vehicles (AT­PZEVs):
·
Stage I (2003­2005) $3,300
·
Stage II (2006­2008) $1,500
·
Stage III (2009­2011) $700.
Estimated Co­Benefits
Adoption of LEV II standards in Connecticut is
calculated to reduce toxic pollutants (acetaldehyde,
1,3­butadiene, formaldehyde, and benzene) by 104
tons in 2020.

2. GHG Feebate Program
Under a feebate system, purchasers of high CO2­emitting
vehicles would pay a fee, whereas purchasers of low­CO2­
emitting vehicles would receive a rebate. The cutoff
threshold can be designed to be revenue neutral so that
total fees are equal to total rebates. The levels of fees and
rebates for vehicles should be designed to maximize
influence on consumer demand for low­emission vehicles.
A feebate system could be implemented regionally to

New Britain – Hartford Bus Rapid Transit (BRT);
studies are concluding on Hartford East BRT and
New Haven­Hartford­Springfield Rail. About $100
million committed for the project at this time. The
total project cost is $338 million.

Implement a package of transit improvements and land­
use policies and incentives to achieve a 3% reduction in
VMT below the 2020 baseline. The package consists of six
complementary elements:
1. Double transit ridership by 2020.
2. Consider potential funding mechanisms for new
transit investments, such as road pricing and the
Connecticut Transportation Strategy Board’s fuel
tax recommendation.
3. Establish a coordinated interagency program to
promote smart growth in Connecticut using
regulatory, financial, and planning tools.
4. Redirect at least 25% of new development
(forecast population and employment) to growth­
appropriate locations, as indicated by the State
Plan of Conservation and Development.
5. Study a potential road­pricing pilot project,
prepare a feasibility design study by 2006, and
implement the pilot project if it is shown to be
effective. Study the potential impact on equity and
sprawl and consider broader implementation of
road pricing in the long term.
6. Consider complementary VMT reduction
incentives, such as commuter choices, location­
efficient mortgages, and mileage­based
insurance.

9. Clean Diesel and Black Carbon (BC)
Scientists have identified BC, a component of diesel
particulate matter (PM), as having a large and fast­acting
warming impact on the atmosphere. Diesel engines emit
roughly half of the BC in the United States. This program
would provide incentives to accelerate the use of ultra­low
sulfur diesel and to accelerate adoption of engine
improvements and tailpipe control technology to reduce
emissions of BC.

Progress ­ In Process
DEP pilot programs using ultra­low sulfur diesel
school buses (completed in Norwich, being
expanded to New Haven, Hartford, Bridgeport). DOT
and DEP are collaborating on a program to promote
diesel retrofits and the use of clean fuels on off­road
construction equipment (Q bridge project). 181
buses in New Haven are being retrofitted with diesel
oxidation catalysts and Spiracle crankcase controls.
These buses are now being fueled with ultra­low
sulfur diesel fuel that is dosed with a fuel­borne
catalyst to further reduce emissions.

29. Promote Voluntary Programs and Actions
To promote GHG reductions in particular sectors, state
government can encourage participation in voluntary
programs that exist on the national level through Federal
non­governmental agencies. In addition, the state may
enter into direct voluntary or negotiated agreements with
industries or industrial sectors. Negotiated agreements, for
example, would result in agreed­upon GHG emission
reductions or offsets as an alternative to compliance or
enforcement actions resulting from violation of air pollution
legislation (such as violations of Clean Air Act state
implementation plan requirements), or as an alternative for
possible regulation of GHG emissions.

Progress ­ In Process
Efforts to promote participation in existing programs
have resulted in:
·
16 CT towns joining the International Council
for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) Cities

(CHP)
CHP is the simultaneous production of electricity and heat
using a single fuel. The heat produced from the electricity­
generating process is captured and used to produce high­
and low­level steam. The steam can be used as a heat
source for both industrial and domestic purposes and in
steam turbines to generate additional electricity (i.e.,
combined­cycle power).

no specific actions were suggested. Depending on
the implementation approach chosen, some or all of
the funding could come from the federal government,
State government, or private entities.
Estimated Co­Benefits
This project could provide ancillary benefits such as
odor control, water quality, and improved farm
economics through generating additional income. In
addition, this project could support the continuation of
farming in the State that can support both smart
growth initiatives and the “increase purchase of
locally grown food” option mentioned later.

36. Reduce Use of Non­Farm Fertilizer
A portion of nitrogen applied to the soil is subsequently
emitted as N2O; therefore, a reduction in the quantity of
fertilizer applied can reduce N2O emissions. The goal
is to support education programs to reduce non­farm
(i.e., commercial and residential) fertilizer use by 7.5%
by 2010 and 15% by 2020.

Progress ­ In Process

professionals in CT. An accreditation course was
conducted in CT in 2004; AND another will in
February 2005. There have been numerous
presentations, articles, and displays on the organic
landcare standards to groups such as the CT
Chapter of the Association of Landscape Architects,
organic farming groups, garden clubs, environmental
organizations, and faith based communities.

These efforts can reduce nutrient loading in water
bodies; increase the organic content of soil (and thus
increase carbon sequestration); reduce GHG
emissions and water consumption through natural
lawn care methods, such as decreased mowing, and
watering; and increase biodiversity.

37. Buy Locally Grown Food
Encouraging consumers to buy local produce reduces
emissions associated with the transport of agricultural
products. The goal is to purchase an additional 10% of
CT’s farm products from local sources instead of
conventional markets.

Progress ­ In Process
The CT Grown program of the CT Department of
Agriculture continues to work to increase the
purchase of locally grown foods in the state.
Currently there are 19 schools and 25 farmers
participating in the Farm to Schools program that
purchase local produce for school cafeterias. There
are presently 70 farmers’ markets in the state selling
locally grown produce. In addition, a number of large
institutions are currently purchasing or considering

25

purchasing locally grown produce, including the
Department of Corrections and the University of
Connecticut. In 2004, the Department of Agriculture
was able to hire an additional employee to work on
the CT Grown program, using funds it receives from
the USDA.
In 2004, legislation was enacted to require DAS to
give preference to CT grown in contracts for dairy,
poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables (An Act
Concerning Preservation of the Family Farm and
Long Island Sound, PA 04­222) and to also require
DOA to establish a “Connecticut Farm Fresh”

39. Urban Tree Planting Program
Plant trees in urban areas to reduce the consumption of
energy for heating and cooling buildings, thereby helping
avoid fossil fuel emissions in the energy sector and
increasing the carbon stock of non­forest land. The goal is
to provide funding and other support to plant an additional
15,000 sufficiently sized tress by 2010, and 20,000 more
by 2020.

Progress ­ In Process
DEP has had an urban forestry grant program for CT
towns in place for about 12 years, using funding from
the USDA Forest Service. In 2004, a total of $76,860
was awarded to CT towns for urban forestry
programs. Of this, $28,260 was specifically
designated for urban tree planting in the towns of
East Haddam, Bristol, and Norwalk.

Expected Cost per Ton GHG
The expected cost would equal $9,815/MTCO2e. It is
estimated that the program would cost $500,000 per
year starting in 2004, and have a potential mix of
federal and State government funding.
Estimated Co­Benefits
This program could lead to reductions in other air
emissions. Planting programs in urban areas should
have few barriers to implementation because many
communities are actively pursuing tree­planting
programs for reasons other than climate change,
such as aesthetics.

40. Forest and Agricultural Land Preservation
This program would support the protection of forestland
and agricultural land preserves and the carbon­absorption
capacity of existing forest and agricultural lands, enabling
continued carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. The
goal is to preserve existing forest and agricultural land in
CT.

Progress ­ In Process
To date, 23% of the Connecticut Department of
Agriculture’s 130,000­acre preservation goal has
been met through the purchase of land development
rights program. As of December 2004, a total of
29,980 acres on 211 Connecticut farms have been
preserved through this program. During 2004, $2.2
million was allocated by State Bond Commission to
purchase development rights on 1,133 acres of prime
farm.
Expected GHG Reductions
·
2010 = 0.283 MMTCO2e
·
2020 = 0.283 MMTCO2e
Expected Cost per Ton GHG
The expected cost would equal $137/MTCO2e. It is
estimated that the program would cost $57 million
per year: $46.6 million for the forestland preservation
and $10.5 million for the agricultural land
preservation. A significant portion of the open space
land preserved through State funds was conducted
under a program in which the DEP provided towns
and private conservation groups with matching
grants, usually 50% of the land cost. If such a
program were to comprise half of the DEP’s efforts,
the 4,700 acres could be acquired at a cost to the
state of approximately $21.4 million per year. The
agricultural land preservation is assumed to come
from State government funding.
Estimated Co­Benefits
Ancillary benefits include promoting wildlife habitat,
protecting and improving water quality, improving the
“livability” of the State, supporting smart growth
initiatives in the State, supporting economic
development (especially in rural parts of the State) by
maintaining agricultural capacity, and enabling the
continued consumption of locally grown agricultural
products.

Durable wood products, such as furniture or construction
lumber, sequester carbon for long periods of time, as long
as the timber is produced as a result of certified
sustainable harvesting practices. Wood products are also
much less energy­intensive to create than materials such
as steel, plastic, aluminum, and concrete. The

Some of the potential ancillary benefits of this
program include decreased raw materials acquisition
(fossil fuel energy and other emissions and changes
in forest carbon sequestration); decreased
manufacturing (fossil fuel energy emissions) and
transportation­related emissions; reduced need for
new disposal facilities, avoiding land use and siting
issues, waste transportation issues, other pollutants

Create a financial incentive for qualifying renewable
energy production with a per­kWh tax credit.
Explore a PTC ($0.018/kWh for 10 years) for new Class I
renewable projects in Connecticut that are not covered by
the federal renewable PTC (i.e., fuel cells, solar, landfill
gas, biomass, hydrogen, and small hydro). This would be
a potential mechanism to achieve RPS and promote
development of in­state renewables in light of future
information on the availability of and competition for
biomass resources.

Progress ­ In Process
Although not directly a Connecticut­based PTC,
Public Act 03­135 requires UI and CL&P to sign long­
terms power contracts for no less than 100 MW’s of
clean energy. This act requires that power contracts
for no less than a 10­year period (the length of the
federal ptc is 10 years) be signed at the wholesale
market price plus up to $0.055 per kWh (the federal
PTC is inflation­adjusted at a rate of $0.015 per kWh)
To date, DPUC has conducted a proceeding that
established a procedure and process guidelines to
implement the statute. In addition, The CCEF
organized a kick­off meeting to prospective
developers and financiers to discuss the process and
issue a draft RFP for public comment (11/16).
The need to develop a Connecticut­based PTC will in
part depend upon how this act is successfully
implemented.

Cross-Cutting Recommendations
54. Public Education Initiative
Information and education is an important tool for
implementing GHG plans and programs, because it alerts
the public and key parties to the need for action and the
availability of programs and services. The goal is to foster
a broad awareness of climate change issues (including co­
benefits) and impacts among CT citizens and to engage
citizens in actions to reduce GHG emissions. The
recommendation details education and outreach initiatives
for the following target sectors: policy makers, community
leaders, future generations, community­based
organizations, and the general public.

Progress ­ In Process
The Climate Change Education Committee continues
to meet regularly to coordinate education and
outreach in CT. Progress during 2004 includes:
further development of the state’s climate change
web site (www.ctclimatechange.com); numerous
outreach and technical assistance events for
municipalities and universities; establishment of a CT
Science Center Collaborative to integrate climate
science and research into the programming of the
state’s science centers and museums; continued
research on messaging and public opinion on global
warming; and continued networking and collaboration
among the many organizations involved in outreach
on climate change and related issues in CT.

55. Emissions Inventory and Registry
Inventory, reporting, and registry systems are important
tools for implementation of GHG plans because they
provide a means of measuring and tracking success and

Progress ­ In Process
DEP is working with other northeast states and
NESCAUM on the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Registry (RGGR) project. The goal is to develop a

HISTORY OF CONNECTICUT’S
CLIMATE CHANGE LEADERSHIP

HISTORY OF CONNECTICUT’S CLIMATE CHANGE LEADERSHIP
New England Governors/Eastern Canadian Premiers Climate Change Action Plan
The New England states and the eastern Canadian provinces have a long history of working
together to address and resolve environmental issues. Starting in the 1980s, the New England
governors (NEG) and eastern Canadian premiers (ECP) recognized the harmful effects of acid
rain on the region’s forests and the negative impact on its economy. The NEG/ECP passed a
joint resolution calling for the elimination of emissions contributing to those effects. As a result,
states and provinces acted to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx).
Those steps later served as a model for regional and federal action.
In 2000, the NEG/ECP, citing findings in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change Third Assessment Report, commenced regional discussions on global warming
and its environmental impact. A March 2001 NEG/ECP workshop on the science and impacts of
climate change provided a framework for a climate change action plan. In August 2001, the
NEG/ECP signed the Climate Change Action Plan 20011 at their annual meeting in Westbrook,
Connecticut.
The vision of the Climate Change Action Plan is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to a
level that stabilizes the earth’s climate and eliminates the negative impact of climate change. The
plan outlines important short­ and mid­term goals for measuring progress toward the long­term
objective based on environmental needs (not feasibility). The plan also specifies nine action
items the states and provinces should undertake. Those goals and action items are detailed in
Table 1.1. The plan further provides a recalibration mechanism. Starting in 2005, and continuing
every five years thereafter, progress in achieving the goals will be evaluated. The goals will be
adjusted, if necessary, and future emission goals may be established.

Table H.1
2001 NEG/ECP Climate Change Action Plan and Related Resolutions
Regional Goals of Climate Change Action Plan
Short­term: Reduce regional GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2010.
Mid­term: Reduce regional GHG emissions to at least 10% below 1990 levels by 2020.
Long­term: Reduce regional GHG emissions sufficiently to eliminate any dangerous threat to the climate (current
science suggests that this level is 75% to 85% below 2001 levels).
Action Item 1 – Establishment of a Regional Standardized GHG Emissions Inventory
Goal: Each jurisdiction should establish a standardized inventory beginning with 1999 GHG emissions levels,
reported every three years.
Action Item 2 – Establishment of a Plan for Reducing GHG Emissions and Conserving Energy
Goal: Each jurisdiction should create a plan articulating measures for achieving GHG reductions in view of the
regional short and mid­term targets.
Action Item 3 – Promotion of Public Awareness
Goal: By 2005, make the public aware of the problems and impact of climate change and what actions they can take
at home and at work to reduce the release of GHGs. The public should also be made cognizant of adaptive
measures they can accomplish.
Action Item 4 – Need for State and Provincial Governments to Lead by Example
Goal: Reduce end­use emissions of GHGs through improved energy efficiency and lower carbon fuels within the
public sector by 25% by 2012, as measured from an established baseline.
Action Item 5 ­ Reduction of GHGs From the Electricity Sector
Goal: Reduce the amount of CO2 emitted per MWh of electricity use within the region by 20% of current emission
rate by 2025.
Action Item 6 ­ Reduction of the Total Energy Demand Through Conservation
Goal: By 2025, increase the amount of energy saved through conservation programs (as measured in tons of GHG
emissions) within the region by 20% using programs designed to encourage residential, commercial, and
industrial energy conservation.
Action Item 7 ­ Reduction and/or Adaptation of Negative Social, Economic, and Environmental Impact of
Climate Change
Goal: Broaden the understanding of forecast effects on climate and plan the adaptation to these changes, where
possible. In addition, seek climate adaptation options that do not increase GHG emissions further.
Action Item 8 ­ Reduction in the Transportation Sector’s Growth in GHG Emissions
Goal: Slow the growth rate of transportation emissions in the near future, better understand the impact of
transportation programs and projects on total emissions, and seek ways to reduce these emissions. Work with
federal officials to improve the energy efficiency of vehicles for sale to the public.
Action Item 9 ­ Creation of a Regional Emissions Registry and Exploration of a Trading Mechanism
Goal: To create a uniform, coordinated basis for emissions banking and trading.
Resolution 27­7 (August 2002)
Encourage and promote climate change proposals focused on LED traffic lights; partnerships with regional colleges
and universities for emissions­reduction programs; purchase of high­efficiency and low­emission office equipment;
and use of clean, energy efficient vehicles in state and provincial fleets.
Resolution 28­7 (September 2003)
Evaluate “smart growth” approaches to land­use and development and seek recommendations for implementation.
Continue to develop the administration, tracking, and reporting framework for a voluntary regional GHG registry.
Work to develop voluntary partnerships with cities, towns, and businesses to increase the efficacy of NEG/ECP’s
climate change work.

The goals and results outlined in the plan are for the New England and eastern Canada region in
aggregate and may not be achieved in equal measure by each jurisdiction. It is recognized that
differences in emissions characteristics and inventories, social and political systems, economic
profiles (including transportation, utility, and industrial infrastructures), and resources will lead
to different approaches among the jurisdictions in contributing to the regional goals. However,

37



each jurisdiction in the region has committed to participate in achieving the regional goals and
will work with the other states and provinces in the region on this important effort.
Connecticut’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory (1990-2000)
Connecticut has quantified its emissions contributing to global climate change by completing
GHG emissions inventories for 1990 through 2000. Connecticut Greenhouse Gas Inventory
1990–2000 (August 2003) was developed by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use
Management (NESCAUM) using the State GHG Inventory Tool, an Excel­based software
package produced by the State and Local Climate Change Program of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA).2 The inventory summarizes Connecticut’s emissions of the six major
GHGs covered in national inventories: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
(N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The
inventory also incorporates information from all major emissions sources in Connecticut: fossil
and biomass fuel combustion, industrial production processes, gas and oil activities, landfills and
wastewater treatment, agricultural sources, and land­use changes and forestry. To make the
inventory comparable to the U.S. national GHG inventory and inventories from other
industrialized countries, GHG quantities are expressed in million metric tons of CO2 equivalent
(MMTCO2e), which is derived from the relative global warming potential of each of these gases.
Table 1.2 summarizes Connecticut’s GHG emissions from 1990 through 2000 as developed by
NESCAUM. In 2000, Connecticut emitted 48.485 MMTCO2e of GHGs, approximately 9 percent
more than in 1990. As shown in Figure 1.1, about 90 percent of the total emissions in 2000 came
from the combustion of fossil fuels—oil, gas, and coal—to power the State’s cars and factories,
heat and cool its homes and buildings, and generate electricity. Municipal solid waste
management was responsible for about 6 percent of total emissions. Industrial processes and
agriculture contributed less than 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively. Carbon stored in forests
and soils offset about 4 percent of Connecticut’s annual GHG emissions, resulting in net GHG
emissions (total emissions minus carbon sequestered) of 46.45 MMTCO2e in 2000.

2

Produced by Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) and the Connecticut
Department of Environmental Protection, with support from the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund. The Inventory
Tool incorporates revisions to EPA’s guidelines for estimating GHG emissions up through November 2002. The
Connecticut Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990–2000 (August 2003) uses all revised modules of the Inventory Tool
issued through May 30, 2003.

Another breakdown of the State’s GHG emissions in 2000 is shown in Figure 1.2. CO2, largely
from fossil fuel combustion, accounted for more than 90 percent of the emissions. The
contribution of the major GHGs to Connecticut’s GHG emissions profile is similar to national
figures.
Figures 1.3 and 1.4 show the State’s GHG emissions trend between 1990 and 2000. Connecticut
GHG emissions declined about 5 percent through the first half of the decade, most likely as a
result of a shift in the utility fuel mix used in electric power generation, a shift in waste

management practices from landfilling to waste­to­energy, a recession in the early part of the
decade, and a slight decline in population. Gross GHG emissions, however, increased by more
than 15 percent in the second half of the decade, again partly a result of changes in fuel mix, the
economy, and the population.

CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion result from stationary sources (i.e., power plants,
industrial facilities, and home heating systems) and from mobile sources, such as motor vehicles.
Transportation accounts for approximately 40 percent of CO2 emissions annually. Primary
energy consumption in the residential and commercial/industrial sectors is approximately 20
percent and 10 percent, respectively. The electric utility sector contributes between 18 and 30

percent of the CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The great fluctuation in electric utility
CO2 emissions stems from the changing fuel mix used to produce electricity in Connecticut.
This inventory provides a basis for establishing baseline emissions. Upon review of the
NESCAUM inventory data, some adjustments were made to some of the historical data to
establish a baseline for the 2003 Climate Change Stakeholder Dialogue. The most significant
adjustment was for the transportation sector.
Connecticut’s Climate Change Leaders
The State of Connecticut has a tradition of climate change leadership. From the late 1970s
through the 1990s, the State passed more than 20 environmental laws that ranged in scope from
allowing towns and cities to exempt solar collectors from property taxes to providing low­cost
loans for energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements to the residential, commercial,
and industrial sectors. In 1990, the General Assembly passed the Global Warming Act, which
required action on state building codes, energy efficient vehicles and appliances, and a
comprehensive energy plan for the state.
Reducing GHG emissions in Connecticut to 1990 levels and lower will require aggressive action
by all sectors of society, including its businesses and institutions, colleges and universities,
nongovernmental organizations, and local governments. All sectors will play a vital role in
focusing attention on climate change in Connecticut and implementing the GHG mitigation
actions proposed in this plan.
Connecticut businesses have shown leadership in the development of cleaner and renewable
energy technologies, such as fuel cells, gas turbines, and the American wind turbine. In addition,
many Connecticut businesses and industries have embraced cost­effective measures to reduce
GHG emissions voluntarily. Those activities include energy conservation and efficiency, fuel
switching and renewable energy purchases, the development of cleaner technologies and the
application of cleaner industrial processes, the use of cleaner and more efficient vehicle fleets,
carbon sequestration (through improved agriculture and forestry practices as well as participation
in voluntary offset projects), and participation in public outreach and awareness. Some
companies have joined partnerships or voluntary programs to reduce pollution and emissions and
increase corporate stewardship.
Seventeen of the State’s colleges and universities have formally committed to making an
inventory of GHG emissions on campus and taking actions to reduce emissions. A number of
colleges are purchasing renewable energy; many are improving the energy efficiency of lighting,
heating, ventilation, and cooling systems and computers and appliances. Connecticut’s colleges
and universities have also embraced new cleaner technologies, such as solar photovoltaics (i.e.,
direct conversion of sunlight into electricity), fuel cells, and geothermal heating systems. Some
colleges are incorporating green building design standards into new construction and renovations
and bio­fuels into their fleets.
Non­governmental organizations have been strong supporters of climate change initiatives in
Connecticut. Their support is invaluable in engaging public involvement in understanding the
wide spectrum of issues linked to climate change. State and regional nonprofit organizations

42



have acted as catalysts for grassroots action, corporate stewardship, and public policy initiatives.
The combined efforts of many non­governmental organizations are helping to educate the public
about climate change, assist the State’s businesses and institutions, provide resources to
municipalities, promote leadership among faith­based communities, build partnerships, and focus
the attention of policy makers. Foundations are supporting much of this work through grants.
Sixteen Connecticut municipalities participating in the international Cities for Climate Protection
program. These jurisdictions have shown leadership by passing resolutions to inventory and
reduce GHG emissions from municipal operations. Many other municipalities have begun to
save money through energy efficient measures, such as the installation of light­emitting diode
(LED) traffic lights, purchasing Energy Star office equipment, performing energy benchmarking
and efficiency upgrades at schools and other public buildings, improving public transit options,
and increasing the efficiency of municipal fleets. Several have participated in the utility­
sponsored Community­Based Program, which coordinates all conservation and load management
programs in selected cities and towns.
State initiatives include the planning and development of statewide GHG mitigation measures as
well as the implementation of GHG reduction actions in State operations. Some actions are
embodied in State statutes and regulations; others are informal programs or policies. The State
has implemented energy performance standards for State buildings and is promoting green
building design on major capital projects, purchasing environmentally preferable products
ranging from computers to lighting, providing certain tax incentives for clean fuels, and
performed energy benchmarking on State buildings to improve efficiencies. In addition, the State
is increasing its use of electronic media, resulting in a commensurate reduction in paper
consumption.
Designing a Connecticut Process to Develop a Climate Change Action Plan
In 2002, the State of Connecticut, in partnership with the Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation and
the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, convened a summit on behalf of a Governor’s Steering
Committee3 to establish a State process for developing a climate change action plan. The summit
took place in October 2002, at the Pocantico Conference Center of the Rockefeller Brothers
Fund. Participants from 13 State agencies4 assembled to establish a participatory process to
develop an innovative and responsible plan to address climate change.
The summit included presentations on the science of climate change and on strategic planning
and policy development by the States of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Participants discussed

the basic structure of a climate change action plan, including a GHG emissions inventory,
baselines, targets, GHG reduction options, and an implementation plan. The summit participants
established three Connecticut climate change goals for 2003:
1. Publish and distribute a report summarizing Connecticut’s actions on climate change – this
goal was realized with the publication of Pocantico Paper Number 6, Leading By Example:
Connecticut Collaborates to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions (2003).5
2. Update a GHG emissions inventory for 1990–2000 – this goal was realized with the
publication of Connecticut Greenhouse Gas Inventory 1990 – 2000 (August 2003).6
3. Coordinate a process to identify actions to reduce Connecticut’s GHG emissions – this goal
was realized through the Connecticut Climate Change Stakeholder Dialogue of 2003 (see
details below).
Coordinating a Connecticut Climate Change Stakeholder Dialogue in 2003
In 2003, the Governor’s Steering Committee on Climate Change developed the CT Climate
Change Stakeholder Dialogue to formulate policy recommendations to help the State meet or
exceed greenhouse gas targets established by the New England Governors/Eastern Canada
Premiers Climate Change Agreement of 2001. Between April and December 2003, nearly 100
organizations participated in the CT Climate Change Stakeholder Dialogue. Participants
included businesses, non­profit organizations, government agencies, and academia. In addition
to the 25 stakeholders, there were 5 working groups that performed policy and technical analysis
in the following areas: transportation and land use; electricity generation; residential,
commercial, and industrial energy use; agriculture, forestry, and waste emissions; and education.
The general public provided input through a series of four public information meetings and
through written comments. A list of stakeholders is provided in the appendix.
The Center for Clean Air Policy facilitated the dialogue as a non­binding advisory process to the
Governor’s Steering Committee. Connecticut Innovations, on behalf of the Clean Energy Fund,
provided most of the funding, with additional support from the Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation.
In addition, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection provided funding for
advanced modeling for the electricity sector as recommended by stakeholders.
The stakeholders identified 55 separate recommendations that together achieve 72.7 percent of
the gap toward the 2010 NEG/ECP target and 70.7 percent of the gap toward the 2020 target.
Stakeholders unanimously agreed to 52 of the 55 final recommendations. The remaining three
recommendations fell one vote short and were recorded as garnering a supermajority.
Descriptions of the recommendations and the associated GHG reductions as well as a full report
of the process is provided in the January 2004 report Connecticut Climate Change Stakeholder
Dialogue: Recommendations to the Governor’s Steering Committee. This document can be
found at http://www.ctclimatechange.com/ct_action_plan.html.

In March 2004, based on the Governor’s Steering Committee’s recommendation, the Governor
accepted thirty­eight of the recommendations for immediate implementation. Staff to the
Governor’s Steering Committee would perform additional analysis on the remaining 17
recommendations so that they could be considered for implementation in the near future.
Co-Benefits: Energy, Economy, and the Environment Working Together
In 2004, the Connecticut General Assembly passed Public Act 04­252, “An Act Concerning
Climate Change” (see appendix for full text of this Public Act). The Act establishes a goal for
the state to reduce GHG emissions to contribute to the regional GHG reduction goals of 1990
levels by 2010 and 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. It also requires the GSC to develop an
action plan to achieve these goals and to submit such plan to the General Assembly by January
2005. This report is the action plan that fulfills the legislative requirement of Public Act 04­252.
The Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) was hired in August of
2004 to assist the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in the
implementation of “An Act Concerning Climate Change,” Public Act 04­252, and in the
development of the draft 2005 climate change action. NESCAUM performed additional analysis
on some of the 55 recommendations in the January 2004 report, Connecticut Climate Change
Stakeholder Dialogue: Recommendations to the Governor’s Steering Committee. Specifically,
NESCAUM assisted in an in­depth evaluation of seven of the stakeholder recommendations
including:
·
·

·

GHG Feebate Program – GHG emissions reductions and REMI analyses;
Tailpipe GHG Standards – GHG emissions reductions analysis;
Create Heating Oil Conservation Fund – GHG emissions reductions, REMI, and COBRA
analyses;
Create Natural Gas Conservation Fund – GHG emissions reductions, REMI, and COBRA
analyses;
Renewable Portfolio Standards – GHG emissions reductions analysis;
Restore the Clean Energy Fund – GHG emissions reductions analysis; and
Regional Cap and Trade Program – GHG emissions reductions analysis.

The analysis included assessments, in some cases reassessments, of GHG emissions reductions
and co­benefits of these actions to include additional environmental measures – impacts on
public health and broader economy­wide benefits. Identifying and quantifying the co­benefits,
or hidden positive externalities that result from actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
provides for more informed decision­making and establishes precedence for public policy
measures to recognize the benefits, along with the costs of a specific action.
The following tools were used in NESCAUM’s analysis: Economic Demographic Forecasting
and Simulation Model (EDFS), a socio­economic modeling tool created by Regional Economic

REMI, EPA, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, Connecticut Department of
Public Utility Control, Connecticut Department of Revenue Services, Connecticut Clean Energy
Fund, and a select group of experts to develop inputs, assumptions, and evaluate the analyses.9
This dialogue involved a series of regular meetings by phone and in person, all of which took
place in the fall of 2004. The State and Local Capacity Building Branch of the Environmental
Protection Agency generously offered support for the additional runs.
Upon the completion of the draft results of the in­depth analyses of the seven recommendations,
NESCAUM presented the results to the Governor’s Steering Committee. Based on the
Committee’s feedback, revisions were made to finalize the results of the comprehensive analysis
of these seven recommendations. The results can be found in the detailed narratives for each
recommendation in this report. NESCAUM’s analyses were made possible by support from the

1. California LEV II Standards1
Recommended Action:

Adopt LEV II standards in Connecticut.

The California Low Emission Vehicle II (LEV II) program establishes strict emission
standards for all new cars sold in California as well as for any other state that adopts the
program. The standards address nonmethane organic gas (NMOG), a precursor of ozone
pollution in the lower atmosphere; nitrogen oxides (NOx); and carbon monoxide (CO).
The LEV II Smart Growth Strawman Proposal, prepared by the Connecticut Fund for the
Environment, is the primary source of information on LEV II recommendations, costs,
and benefits.
The LEV II program consists of two complementary components: the low­emission
vehicle (LEV) requirement and the advanced technology vehicle program. Under the
California standards, 90 percent of a manufacturer’s vehicle fleet is required to meet strict
baseline emissions standards. The emission standards for LEVs are much lower than the
corresponding federal standards and can be achieved through the application of
conventional pollution­control technology to the internal combustion engine. The
remaining 10 percent of the vehicle fleet must be lower emitting than LEV standards,
which qualify for credits under the advanced technology component of the program. 2 The
advanced technology components of the LEV II standards are summarized in Table 1.1.

The LEV II strawman proposal, prepared by Connecticut Fund for the Environment, is the primary source

excerpted verbatim from the LEVII strawman proposal (see Supporting Document 4).

The LEV II advanced­technology vehicle program consists of three categories of vehicles: gold, silver
and bronze. The path likely to be followed by Connecticut would require that 6 percent of the total
vehicle fleet satisfy the bronze standard, consisting of ultra­clean partial zero­emission vehicles, or
PZEVs. Those PZEVs would consist of conventional internal combustion vehicles that are 90 percent
cleaner than normal LEVs (and that produce zero evaporative emissions). Two percent of the vehicle
fleet would have to meet the silver standard, consisting of advanced technology (AT) PZEVs (such as the
hybrid­electric vehicle). Finally, automakers can satisfy the gold standard, 2 percent, true­zero­emission
vehicle by offering either battery­electric or fuel cell vehicles. If they choose the fuel cell path, they
would offer 250 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles for sale anywhere in the country by 2008.

Connecticut may elect to adopt the California standards either legislatively or
administratively. Section 22a­174g of the Connecticut General Statutes authorizes the
Commissioner of Environmental Protection to adopt regulations implementing
California’s motor vehicle emissions standards on the Connecticut Department of
Environmental Protection’s (DEP’s) own initiative. Such standards may be adopted either
by emulation or by reference to the relevant California regulations. In addition to the
authority granted by § 177 of the Clean Air Act, the Connecticut General Assembly
retains its inherent power to adopt any legislation that is necessary to protect the health
and welfare of the citizens of the State.
Implementation could begin as early as model year 2008 if Connecticut acts during the
2004 session. Under LEV II, auto dealers in Connecticut, beginning with the model year
2008, would be required to sell new vehicles that are certified to California emissions
standards.

Estimated Co-Benefits
Adoption of LEV II standards in Connecticut is calculated to reduce toxic pollutants
(acetaldehyde, 1,3­butadiene, formaldehyde, and benzene) by 104 tons in 2020.5
Connecticut’s adoption of LEV II will bring a better regional balance and strengthen
regional demand for the sale of LEVs, because Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont
have already adopted California emissions standards.

In December 2004, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection adopted
regulations to implement LEV II. The regulations will go into effect and require
compliant vehicles commencing with the 2008 model year.

2. GHG Feebate Program
Recommended Action:

Establish a Feebate Program.

A feebate program uses both incentives and disincentives to induce consumer buying
practices that reflect the negative externalities associated with the purchase of a motor
vehicle. It also provides manufacturers with an incentive to improve technology to reduce
emissions. As more states become involved in a feebate, the incentive to manufacturers
increases. Consequently, the effectiveness of a feebate would be strongly enhanced if
Connecticut’s leadership on the issue could be leveraged to spur a regional program.
Under a feebate system, the state would set a “pivot point,” based on the amount of CO2
emitted by the vehicle per mile driven. Vehicles that had emitted less CO2 would receive
a rebate. Those emitting higher levels of CO2 would pay a fee. The fees and rebates
would be assessed based on $/lbs. of CO2 per 100 miles driven ($/#CO2100M) rate. For
example, consumers would have to pay $1,000 for pound of CO2 per 100 miles consumed
($1,000/$/#CO2100M) that their vehicle goes over the pivot point. Thus, the further the
vehicle’s CO2 rating is from the pivot point, the greater the fee or the rebate.
A feebate program can be designed in several different ways, taking into account the
classes of vehicle to be covered, the manner in which the fees and rebates are to be
calculated, and the way in which those fees or rebates are to be collected. A feebate
system can also be designed to either generate revenue or to be revenue neutral (i.e.,
rebates disbursed equal the amount of fees collected, less administrative costs).6
Design Assumptions
§

6

Establish a single­tier, GHG­based feebate program for all new passenger
vehicles sold in Connecticut beginning in 2005. Although a multi­tiered system
(e.g. one with different fees and rebates for cars than for light trucks) might
initially garner more political support, such systems may provide inferior
incentives and that could distort market signals. Under a multi­tiered feebate
system, a car purchaser could pay a fee, but a consumer who purchases a light
truck with a higher emissions rate than the car could receive a rebate. To address
this, cars and trucks could face the same pivot point, but the fees on trucks would
be lower. Though this removes the most egregious example, trucks would still

For additional information on feebates, see “The GHG Feebates Strawman Proposal,” prepared by the
Connecticut Fund for the Environment, (see Supporting Document 6 in Center for Clean Air Policy
Report).

51



retain a price advantage over cars. For this reason, a single tier applicable to all
vehicles was preferred.

7

§

For those who need large vehicles for work­related purposes, the state could
provide an exemption. This, however, would present significant administrative
difficulties, such as determining the percentage of work­related use of the vehicle
(as opposed to discretionary and personal use). If a particular vehicle were truly
necessary for work, then it would be eligible for certain favorable tax treatment
when the purchaser submits his or her federal income tax.

§

Focusing on consumer demand is particularly important when designing a state
feebate policy. A feebate creates GHG emission reductions by changing
consumer and manufacturer behavior. The result is an increase in the average fuel
economy of the state’s vehicle fleet. Consumers respond to increases/decreases in
vehicle prices, favoring vehicles with higher fuel economy. Manufacturers will
make technological improvements that increase fuel economy and thus reduce the
amount of the fee paid (or increase the amount of the rebate received). A national
study on feebates (the “Greene Study”) indicates that 95% of the fuel economy
improvements achieved by a feebate would be attributable to the manufacturer
response and only 5% would be due to changes in consumer demand. 7 As a
feebate moves from the national to the state level, the signal to manufacturers is
correspondingly lower. This means that, at the state level, consumer demand will
play a much larger relative role in creating the incentives that will drive GHG
reductions.

§

Outside of covering administrative costs, the program will be revenue neutral.
The current analysis was done under the assumption that the program would
generate only enough revenue to cover its administrative costs. The State could
decide to design a system that would generate additional revenue. Any generated
revenues could support public education on low­GHG vehicles and fund other
GHG reduction efforts, such as incentives for the use of low­rolling­resistance
replacement tires or retrofits of high emitting vehicles.

§

Design the GHG feebate program to minimize potential leakage. The feebate
system can be administered at several potential collection points. The most likely
options include point­of­sale feebate charges or feebates administered at the time
of registration. In choosing one of those options, policy makers must be sensitive
to possible leakage issues. Leakage would occur if Connecticut residents were to
buy high­GHG vehicles in another state to avoid paying the fee, or if out­of­state
residents were to buy low­GHG vehicles in Connecticut in order to get the rebate.
Administering the program at the time of registration (where vehicle owners
would have to show payment of Connecticut sales tax), rather than at the time of
sale will eliminate this problem. Because the feebate program would apply only

Increased Fuel Economy (Oakridge National Laboratory, 2004). The Green study also notes a study
done by Davis et. al. indicating a 90% to 10% split.

52



to new vehicle purchases, the dealer would likely handle registering the vehicle
for in­state purchasers, thus reducing the burden on the purchaser. Consumers
who purchase their vehicles out­of­state would bear the burden of registering in
Connecticut and paying the fee at that time.
§

Engage in multistate and regional discussions on establishing a GHG feebate
program for the region. Regional implementation would be more effective in
inducing manufacturers to make technological changes that increase fuel
economy. As noted above, technology change can supply significantly greater
benefits than changes in consumer demand. Several states in the region, including
Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont, have considered
feebates as a potential GHG reduction strategy. Notwithstanding the desirability
of a regional approach, Connecticut should not wait for other states to commit to
implementing a feebate program.

Result of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.036 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.109 MMTCO2e in 2020
These estimates were derived using the Greene Study. The study placed the pivot point
of the program at the average fuel economy for each model year. This creates a generally
revenue neutral program. The authors then assessed two feebates: one at
$19.25/#CO2100M and another at $38.50/#CO2100M.8 The $19.25 feebate resulted in a
16% increase in fuel economy after approximately 10­15 years. The $38.50 feebate
resulted in a 29% increase in fuel economy. This improvement applies to a single model
year in the future, not the entire state fleet. Thus, it takes several years for the benefits to
ripple through the state fleet. The workgroup selected the lower feebate of $19.25 (see
table below for examples of how this would affect vehicle prices; provided in the more
familiar miles per gallon for ease of comparison).
The Greene paper was widely considered by the workgroup as providing the most
definitive analysis. Applying the national to the state level, however, posed considerable
difficulties. The biggest challenge was created by the relative impacts of manufacturer
change versus consumer demand change. In the national model, 95% of the fuel
economy improvement is attributable to changes made by manufacturers. The rest is
from the consumer response. In a state program, the signal to the manufacturers is
weaker. Dr. Greene and others discouraged eliminating the manufacturers’ response
entirely. 9 Consequently, the analysis scaled the manufacturer response based on
Connecticut’s percentage of the national population. This results in Connecticut
capturing about 1% of the manufacturer benefit. With the consumer demand effect left in
8

The authors use a different metric: gallons of gasoline per 100 miles or GP100M. In the study, the
feebates were $500/GP100M and $1,000/GP100M). Since the focus of this analysis is on greenhouse
gases, the metric has been converted to CO2 form gallons of gasoline.

place, the model assumed that approximately 6% of the national benefit level would be
obtainable.
The added benefits of other states joining would dramatically improve the benefits for
Connecticut by increasing the manufacturer’s response. If the rest of the New England
states were to participate, the benefits in Connecticut would increase by approximately
50%.
VMT projections were provided from CT DOT. The state fleet fuel efficiency was

Reasons Behind Differences From Previous Analysis
The previous analysis was based on scaling the results of studies done for California and
for New York. This study was done based on a recent national study that focused on
capturing and explaining the difference between consumer and manufacturer responses.
The results are a direct result taking the full consumer response estimate of the study and
scaling the manufacturer response from the national level to CT.
It should also be noted that the previous analysis went through 2009 under the
assumption that Pavley would begin at that time and reduce the need for the feebate
program. That analysis still holds. However, this analysis shows a feebate is an excellent
way to smooth that transition both before 2009 and beyond.
Estimated Costs
The direct costs of a feebate program are its administration. These costs assumed that the
feebate would be assessed at the time of registration. To the extent the rebate would be
realized through a deduction in taxes, DRS would also be involved in administration. 13
This would require some retooling of software currently utilized in the registration
process and would require additional staff time. The total costs were assumed to be
$100,000/year. The REMI model looked at two indirect costs. First, the state would lose
gas tax revenue due to the decrease in gasoline purchases. Similarly, filling stations
would lose revenue.

Table 2.2
Details of the Feebate Analysis
13

DRS would then be compensated by the fees paid by other vehicle purchasers. DRS, DMV, and other
stakeholders would need to refine the mechanics of the fees and rebates.

3. Vehicle Fleet Incentives and Initiatives
Recommended Action:

Provide vehicle incentives and support state vehicle
initiatives

Within every class of vehicles (e.g., compact car, sedan, station wagon, pickup, SUV,
van) there is at least a 25 percent difference in the GHG emission rate between the most
and least polluting vehicle in a class. A variety of incentives and initiatives can encourage
public and private owners of vehicle fleets to purchase low­GHG vehicles. This approach
presents an opportunity for government to lead by example and achieve economies of
scale to influence vehicle manufacturers’ product offerings.
§

The State should establish a procurement policy to reduce GHG emission
rates for its fleet of cars and light trucks, whether owned, leased, or
contracted. Currently, the State runs a fleet of 3,000 cars and 1,200 vans and
light trucks. It replaces more one­sixth of the fleet each year and achieves
complete fleet turnover every six years.

§

The State should establish a program to encourage municipal and private
sector fleets to purchase low­GHG vehicles. The program could include a
public awareness campaign and public recognition awards.

§

Partner with other Northeast states, local governments, and private fleets to
develop bulk­purchasing proposals for low­GHG vehicles. In the Northeast
states, more than 1 million light­duty vehicles are owned and operated by private
sector and government fleets of 10 or more vehicles—more than 10 percent of all
vehicles sold into fleets in the United States. These fleets are estimated to
generate purchases of about 100,000 new vehicles each year. Industry experts
report that manufacturers require a minimum annual market size of about 25,000
vehicles before they will introduce a new model vehicle to the marketplace. A
limiting factor is that market studies indicate that an immediate market exists for
only about 12,000 vehicles per year in the United States. Thus, an initial
campaign target would be to aggregate an annual purchase of 12,000 or more
vehicles to “match” current market potential. A purchase of this magnitude might
well draw additional low­GHG vehicles (e.g., advanced hybrids) into the market.

§

The State should work with the Federal government to advance policies that
will improve the market for low­GHG vehicles. For example, EPACT
alternative fuel vehicle requirements should be redefined to include hybrid
57



electric vehicles. In addition, Congress should extend the Federal tax deduction
for hybrid vehicles beyond the current sunset date. Finally, encouraging use of
low­GHG vehicles in Federal fleets could have an important market impact.

4. Tailpipe GHG Standards
Recommended Action:

Amend LEV II Regulations to Include GHG Standards

The Low Emission Vehicle II (LEV II) program establishes strict emissions standards for
new cars sold in California, as well as for cars sold in any other state that adopts the LEV
program. In a recent action, the California Air Resources Board (ARB) approved motor
vehicle GHG standards for inclusion in the LEV II program.16 Once these standards are
implemented, the LEV II program will provide substantial greenhouse gas emissions
reductions as well as reductions of nonmethane organic gas (NMOG), nitrogen oxides
(NOx); and carbon monoxide (CO) relative to the federal motor vehicle emission control
program.
Under these standards, new motor vehicles will be required to emit 30 percent fewer
GHGs than would have been emitted without the program. The program establishes two
fleet average standards for GHG emissions: one for cars, light trucks, and small sport
utility vehicles (SUVs) and another for heavier trucks and large SUVs. The standards
will be phased in between the years 2009 and 2016. In 2009, the standards will require a
small reduction in GHGs and will ramp up to a 30 percent reduction requirement for new
vehicles in 2016.
Since Section 177 of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAA) requires that states opting
into the California program must adopt emissions standards that are identical to
California's, there are few design issues to be considered for adopting states. However,
there are lead time and stability requirements under the CAA that influence the timeline
for implementation of the program in states outside of California. These requirements are
discussed below.
Design Assumptions and Recommendations:
§

16

Amend Connecticut's LEV II regulations to include the motor vehicle GHG
standards. In 2004, Connecticut adopted the California LEV II program. At the
time the program was adopted, the motor vehicle GHG standards were not yet
included in LEV II. In order for Connecticut to benefit from the new standards,
the state's LEV II regulation will need to be amended to include the new motor
vehicle GHG standards.

to achieve the benefits of the first model year affected by the GHG regulation.
Section 177 of the CAA requires that states provide automobile manufacturers
two years to transition from one set of emissions standards to another. This is
called a "lead time and stability" requirement. Since the first model year to be
affected by the motor vehicle GHG standards will be 2009, states outside of
California will need to amend their LEV II regulations to include the GHG
standards by January 2, 2006 to ensure that lower emitting vehicles are available
in their states beginning in 2009.17

§

LEV II implementation in Connecticut will be on the same schedule as California
implementation. For the purpose of calculating the GHG reductions that will be
realized in Connecticut from the adoption of the GHG standards, this analysis
assumed that Connecticut will amend their regulations so that lower GHG
emitting vehicles are available beginning in 2009.

Assuming the above implementation schedule is followed, the GHG emissions reductions
listed in Table 1 will be realized in Connecticut in 2010 and in 2020. Greater reductions
will be achieved in later years (2030) when full fleet turnover has occurred.
Result of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.05 MMTCO2e in 2010
2.63 MMTCO2e in 2020
These estimates were derived from ARB analyses detailing the emission levels,
technology options, costs, and benefits associated with the GHG standards.18,19 ,20 It is
important to note that the California cost and technical feasibility analyses contained in
the documents cited below rely heavily on a technical feasibility and cost analysis
conducted by the Northeast States Center for a Clean Air Future (NESCCAF), a sister
organization of NESCAUM.21 Given ARB's reliance on the NESCCAF study,
NESCAUM is thoroughly familiar with the California analysis and the bases for the
assumptions made in this recommendation. To calculate the GHG benefits for
Connecticut, the annual fleet average emission levels from the California analyses was
applied to vehicles sold in Connecticut. For the purposes of this calculation, the shares of

Although this appears to provide three years of lead time, model year 2009 technically begins in calendar
year 2008.

vehicles sold with the near­ and mid­term technology packages were assumed to be the
same in Connecticut as in California.22
Estimated Costs
The NESCCAF report (and the ARB documents) concluded that all of the technologies
needed to achieve the California GHG standards are currently in production. Two­thirds
of the technologies examined in the NESCCAF report are in full volume production at
this time; the remainder is produced in limited volumes. As a result, the GHG standards
are technically feasible. Examples of lower GHG emitting technologies include:
electronic power steering, 6­speed automatic transmissions, improved air conditioning
systems, cylinder deactivation, and turbo charging.23 These technologies will need to be
introduced in higher volumes than are currently being produced in order for the standards
to be met.
Technologies that lower GHGs (with some exceptions) also lower monthly operating
costs for consumers. Thus, there is a net benefit associated with operating lower GHG
emitting vehicles. The NESCCAF study found that consumers would save money over
the life of the vehicle for all technology packages up to the 42 percent GHG reduction
level.
The cost calculations provided below rely on the California documents cited previously.
This analysis assumes that the costs of implementing the measures necessary to meet
these standards are the same in Connecticut as in California. The direct costs of
implementing the tailpipe greenhouse gas standards in Connecticut reflect the average
incremental increase in vehicle costs required to achieve the specified standards. Table 2
shows the additional retail cost of lower GHG emitting vehicles, based on the ARB
analysis.
Table 4.1
Retail Cost to Consumers for the New GHG Standards

Light Trucks / SUV’s
Large Trucks / SUV’s
Near Term (2012)
$367
$277
Mid Term (2016)
$1,064
$1,029

As can be seen from Table 4.1, there is an added up­front cost for cleaner vehicles.
However, as is shown in Table 4.2, this increase is more than offset by lower monthly
operating costs. When the cost of lower monthly gasoline costs is compared with higher
monthly car payments, the result is a net benefit to operators of cleaner vehicles. As can
be seen from the row entitled "monthly net savings to consumers", on average,
consumers will save $11 a month from purchasing a lower GHG emitting car in 2012 and
$3 a month in 2016.
22

CARB developed the standard by assuming that the “near­term” package of efficiency measures was
fully implemented in 2012 and the “mid­term” package by 2016. The specific fleet average emissions
values for these two years are set based on the fleet average achieved by fully implementing these
packages on the auto maker with the heaviest fleet of vehicles. Automakers with lighter weight fleets do
not need to implement all the measures in order to meet the standard.
23
The NESCCAF report examined a total of 35 technologies ­ 33 of which are currently in production at
this time.

The analysis assumed a gasoline price of $1.74 per gallon. At a higher gasoline price,
the comparison would be even more favorable to operators of lower GHG emitting cars.
Impact to the Connecticut Economy
To estimate the LEV program’s impacts on Connecticut’s economy, we scaled the results
estimated for California by the ARB. The cost­benefit analysis conducted by California,
and upon which the costs cited in this paper are calculated, were based on average vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) which can vary state to state. The result of the analysis shows that
the regulation will provide substantial GHG reductions at a cost savings to consumers
and, as a result, will benefit the Connecticut economy.
The analysis is summarized in Table 4.3.

In order to calculate the cost and benefits for Connecticut, some adjustments were made
to the California cost savings estimates. California calculates the “annualized” costs and
benefits of the LEV II regulation by spreading the costs over the lives of the vehicles
assuming a 5 percent discount rate, 16 year life for passenger cars and light­trucks 1, and
19 years for light­trucks 2. Due to road salt and harsh weather, vehicles in Connecticut
are not projected to last as long as they do in California. We assumed the passenger cars
and light­truck life in Connecticut was 13 years and heavier truck life was 16 years. This
increased the annualized costs in Connecticut by 12% for passenger cars and light
trucks/SUVs and 15% for heavier trucks/SUVs. As a result, this analysis shows
Connecticut consumers would realize a lesser economic benefit from the GHG regulation

62



than would consumers in California.24 It is important to note that the approach we used
is conservative and may underestimate the benefits of the GHG regulation to the
Connecticut economy.
Estimated Co-Benefits
A tailpipe greenhouse gas emission standard produces costs and benefits to consumers,
the state, and fuel providers. Based on the impacts of this standard on the California
economy, we expect the results shown in Table 4.4 for Connecticut.
Table 4.4
Estimated Impact of Standards on Connecticut Economy

Output (%)
­0.002%
­0.09%
Personal Income (%)
0.01%

Employment (%)
0.02%
0.2%

The overall effect of the regulation will be an increase in personal income and, as a result,
an increase in employment and sales activity. It is reasonable to assume a similar
distribution of impacts and benefits in the Connecticut economy. In ARB’s analysis of
the economic impacts of this regulation on specific business sectors, they suggest that the
only negative impact is on service stations as their fuel sales decline. This decline is
expected to be compensated by an overall increase in sales activity in other segments of
the economy. The decline in fuel sales is the reason why "output" declines ­ as can be
seen from the summary in Table 4.4.
The benefits of CA LEV II in reducing non­methane organic gas (NMOG), a precursor of
ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere; nitrogen oxides (NOx); and carbon monoxide
(CO) are unchanged from the original analysis.
Progress Update – Action Pending
Additional analysis and data are available from ARB and from NESCAUM. DEP must
adopt regulations in 2005 to maintain program consistency with that of the California
program, as required by the Clean Air Act.
Supplemental Information
NESCAUM can provide detailed information on the technical and cost assumptions, as
well as modeling method and results if needed.

Connecticut's vehicle inventory was developed from actual vehicle data for Connecticut in 2002, the vehicle life for
PC/LDT1 and LDT2, and the new vehicle sales projections through 2020 from CARB. Using these assumptions, the
estimated sales of new PC/LDT1 vehicles range from 146,000 in 2010 to 159,000 in 2020, LDT2 sales in 2010 and
2020 were estimated to be 65,000 and 72,000 respectively. These data suggest that new vehicle sales in Connecticut
include a higher share of LDT2/3 vehicles (30% in 2002) compared to California (18% in 2002). We assumed that the
LDT2/3 share is expected to grow slightly in Connecticut to 31% by 2020 compared with California – 22% by 2020.

5. Public Education Initiative on Transportation
Recommended Action:

Raise the awareness of low GHG emitting vehicles

The State should develop an education program to raise public awareness about the
benefits of low­GHG vehicles, including available incentives, such as GHG feebates and
fleet procurement initiatives, and potential maintenance options, such as the use of low
rolling resistance replacement tires and low friction engine oil.

6. Hydrogen Infrastructure Research and Development Program
Recommended Action:

Develop a comprehensive hydrogen infrastructure research and
demonstration program. 25

Important technical barriers face the transition both to hydrogen as a primary fuel and to systems
that would produce hydrogen in a climate­friendly manner. Nonetheless, the potential benefits to
economic development, the climate, and clean air are so large that Connecticut should start now
to implement a hydrogen research and development program. The recommendations in this
section are based on the detailed strawman proposal on hydrogen prepared by Environment
Northeast.
Recommendations
Research
§ Review existing relevant safety codes and the status of codes under development; assess
potential barriers to development of a hydrogen infrastructure.
§ Review the state of the industry and relevant involvement of Connecticut businesses and
academic institutions.
§ Identify the scenarios for transition to hydrogen economy in the Northeast; identify major
developments needed to effectuate the most likely scenarios; and identify the
implications for Connecticut transportation infrastructure and businesses.
§ Identify potential funding sources for demonstration projects.
§ Identify related initiatives in the region through NEG­ECP, academic institutions,
business associations, and other interested groups.
Demonstration
Create a strategic plan to guide the involvement of State and local governments, educational
institutions, businesses, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), including a list of near­
term pilot and demonstration projects that the State can facilitate through both public and private
initiatives. The plan could also serve as a model for other Northeast states and NEG/ECP. The
following early actions should be considered:
§ Demonstrate the practicality and safety of key hydrogen mobility­system components
(e.g., fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen fuel, vehicle fueling stations, and local hydrogen
production at fueling stations).

25

The Hydrogen Transportation Infrastructure strawman proposal, prepared by Environment Northeast, is the
primary source of information for the Hydrogen recommendations. Significant portions of this section are
excerpted verbatim from the Hydrogen strawman proposal.

Demonstrate co­production of hydrogen for local mobility use at an advanced fossil (or

Facilitate adoption of the necessary safety codes in appropriate jurisdictions.
Conduct targeted public education on hydrogen safety.
Contribute to and participate in national programs to commercialize key technologies
(e.g., vehicle­scale fuel cells or improved on­vehicle hydrogen fuel storage systems).
Identify potential funding sources for priority actions.
Demonstrate zero­emission production of hydrogen through electrolysis and the use of
renewable energy.
Test hydrogen­fueled vehicle performance in cold­weather environments.

Institutional 26
In addition to the specific research and development (R&D) actions proposed above, several
cross­cutting, institutional measures should be considered to help organize and implement a
successful program:
§ Establish a strategic R&D advisory council made up of public, private, and nonprofit
organizations.
§ Encourage State government transportation leaders to be hydrogen and fuel cell
champions.
§ Support university and industry collaboration through a hydrogen and fuel cell
technology incubator. Assess Michigan’s NextEnergy Initiative as a potential model.
§ Initiate a business development initiative to promote investments in innovation through
venture capital, institutional investors, and State economic development authorities.
§ Develop a hydrogen education program ranging from introductory information for
schoolchildren to higher education scholarships for studies in related energy fields.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
In the time frame of the 2010 and 2020 targets, this report does not provide estimates of the
reductions likely to occur from this measure. The potential reductions in the transportation sector
that will occur after 2020 as a result of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies could be as much 22
MMTCO2e in Connecticut. This long­term reduction assumes the availability of low­emissions
hydrogen (i.e., produced from gasification of fossil fuels together with carbon capture and
sequestration, achieving roughly 90 percent improvement in GHG emissions, or renewable
energy sources).
Estimated Costs
The transportation working group proposes the establishment of a Connecticut “Clean Energy
Transportation Fund” that, among other things, would invest in demonstration projects that
advance the state of hydrogen production, storage, distribution, and utilization for transportation
applications. Although it is premature to estimate costs of a Clean Energy Transportation Fund

26

Institutional recommendations outlined by the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund.

or other elements of R&D, the hydrogen program should be designed to prove the value of
hydrogen technologies through a diverse portfolio of end­user applications.
Estimated Co-Benefits
An important ancillary benefit from a hydrogen and fuel program for Connecticut’s
transportation sector is economic development. Connecticut currently has 35 percent, or 1,300,
of the estimated jobs in fuel cell manufacturing, and over $300 million in fuel cell products have
been manufactured and shipped from Connecticut.27 The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund
estimates that the State’s hydrogen and fuel cell industry in Connecticut could create 33,000
direct and indirect jobs.28
Progress – Action Pending
The State anticipates that it will investigate the macro­economic impacts instituting a hydrogen
infrastructure and R&D program for Connecticut’s hydrogen and fuel cell industries.

7. Transit, Smart Growth, and VMT Reduction Package
Recommended Action:

Implement a package of transit improvements and land-use
policies and incentives to achieve a 3 percent reduction in VMT
below the 2020 baseline.

Passenger VMT in Connecticut is projected to increase by 22.2 percent from 2000 to 2020,
according to the ConnDOT’s Master Transportation Plan. 29 Implementation of the measures
recommended here are estimated to reduce that growth to 19.2 percent.
This package of recommendations is aimed at increasing accessibility and low­GHG travel
choices in Connecticut, such as transit (rail and bus), vanpools, walking, and biking. It draws on
more detailed, strawman analyses and proposals, which are listed at the end of this section.
Notably, the Smart Growth Strawman proposal, prepared by the City of New Haven, is the
primary source of information on smart growth recommendations, costs, and benefits. 30
The recommendations consist of six complementary elements:
1. Double transit ridership by 2020.
2. Consider potential funding mechanisms for new transit investments, such as road pricing and
the Transportation Strategy Board fuel tax recommendation.
3. Establish a coordinated, interagency program to promote smart growth in Connecticut:
a. Establish priority funding areas to target State spending in areas considered appropriate
for growth, as established by the State Plan of Conservation and Development (PCD).
b. Establish additional planning capacity at the State level to coordinate activity between
agencies and provide technical support for planning for growth.
c. Establish an outreach program to regional planning organizations (RPOs) and local
planning and zoning commissions to enact smart growth locally through measures such
as transportation and infrastructure planning, regulatory reform, transit­oriented
development, and housing diversity.

4. Redirect at least 25 percent of new development (based on forecast population and
employment) to growth­appropriate locations, as indicated by the PCD.
5. Study a potential road­pricing pilot project, prepare a feasibility design study by 2006, and
implement the pilot project if it is shown to be effective. Study road pricings potential impact
on equity and sprawl, and consider broad implementation of road pricing in the long term.
6. Consider complementary VMT reduction incentives, such as commuter choice, location­
efficient mortgages, and mileage­based insurance.
Below are the details of the core elements of the recommendation.
Transit
Public transportation is an efficient, low­GHG alternative that is used by some 85,000
Connecticut commuters every day. The working group set a goal to double transit ridership as a
means of reducing VMT. ConnDOT performed model runs assuming doubling ridership for rail
and bus transit from the 2020 baseline. The agency also analyzed two stand­alone projects: the
New Haven­Hartford­Springfield rail service and the Manchester/Vernon­Hartford bus rapid
transit service. ConnDOT conducted a bottom­up analysis to cost out the transit investments
necessary to achieve a VMT reduction equivalent to doubling transit ridership. A summary of
key elements is included below (for details, see “Transit Growth Scenario Assumptions”).
Rail Options
§ New Haven­Hartford­Springfield rail service
§ Direct service to New York City (Penn Station) via enhanced Amtrak
§ Enhanced New Haven Line (NHL) service to New York City (Grand Central Terminal)
§ Enhanced intrastate service on NHL Mainline; NHL Branch Lines; Shore Line East
(SLE); and extended SLE, all via enhanced passenger train service (i.e., Amtrak)
Bus Options
§ Manchester/Vernon­Hartford bus rapid transit service
§ Statewide extended span of service and service area
§ Enhanced express service in Hartford and other markets
Other
§ Vanpool enhancements
Potential Funding Sources
The State should consider potential funding mechanisms for new transit investments such as road
pricing and the Transportation Strategy Board fuel tax recommendation.
Smart Growth
Residential and commercial development in suburban and exurban areas increases VMT as
distances between homes and jobs increase. Low­density development cannot support public
transportation, so single­occupancy­vehicles are often the only practical travel option. Since
1970, Connecticut’s population has increased by a modest 12 percent, but VMT have increased
by 78 percent. The National Governors Association reports that nationwide, the increase in VMT
is attributable to more miles driven by existing drivers, rather than to new drivers.
70



Since 1999, eight major reports have documented the impact of sprawl on Connecticut’s
economy, transportation systems, urban infrastructure, environmental resources, and social
equity.31 These studies have put forth recommendations for reducing sprawl by redirecting
growth patterns through appropriate constraints, incentives, and long­term planning. As the eight
reports demonstrate, the State has much to gain by planning for growth in appropriate areas
rather than permitting continued unfettered development. Efficient reuse of existing
infrastructure, reinforced funding for existing schools, improved air and water quality, reduced
road and sewer extension costs, congestion mitigation, increased access to jobs, and affordable
housing are recognized benefits of growth management. Connecticut’s commitment to reducing
GHG emissions underscores the needs identified by the eight reports and introduces an
additional benefit to the already long list. This proposal borrows from the excellent work
contained in these eight reports, with emphasis on recommendations that directly address the
sprawl–climate change nexus.
The proposal is a measured response. It acknowledges that most new growth will continue to
follow current trends. The working group therefore recommends a modest 25 percent penetration
of smart growth principles by 2020 manifested by a 25 percent redirection in projected growth
(population and employment) from inappropriate to appropriate locations, as defined by the
PCD.
Smart Growth Recommendations
Planning, Coordination and Outreach
§ Direct the Office of Policy and Management to address climate change and
transportation­related GHG emissions in the State PCD.
§ Establish additional planning capacity at the State level to coordinate activity between
agencies and provide technical support for growth planning in accordance with the PCD.
§ Establish an outreach program to RPOs and local planning and zoning commissions to
enact smart growth locally through measures such as transportation and infrastructure
planning, regulatory reform, transit­oriented development, and housing diversity.
Financial and Regulatory Mechanisms
§ Adopt smart growth legislation that requires State agencies to target State economic
development, transportation, infrastructure, and school construction spending in areas
considered appropriate for growth, as established by the State PCD.
§ Restructure Section 8.23 of the Connecticut General Statutes to promote integration of
State, regional and municipal PCDs; the new laws should provide for enforcement
“teeth” and a reporting mechanism for inconsistencies.
§ Align statewide policies to support smart growth by pursuing reform in areas identified to
affect the shape of growth in Connecticut, including open space acquisition (see AFW

recommendations), bicycle and pedestrian travel, property tax reform, and building
energy codes (see RCI recommendations).
Establish an oversight group comprising senior staff from all State agencies and NGOs as
well as public participants to ensure that the policies and activities of each agency are
supportive of smart growth.

Road Pricing
A recent Connecticut report completed an analysis of travel demand mode shifts that would
result from a value­pricing toll of $0.20 per mile in the southwest Connecticut corridor.32
ConnDOT’s travel­demand model predicted that this pricing measure alone would create a 6
percent reduction in drive­alone trips, an increase in new rail trips of 72 percent, and an increase
in bus use of 25 percent. The results are consistent with the results of the 1994 COMSIS
Transportation Control Measure study, which indicated that a highway value toll of $0.10 per
mile was expected to reduce VMT by 3.5 percent.
Road Pricing Recommendations
§ The State should pursue Federal Highway Administration funds available for studying
and implementing a road­pricing pilot project. Existing underutilized HOV lanes in the
Hartford area may provide an opportunity for initial study.
§ The State should study the impact that road pricing could have on equity and sprawl.
§ The State should consider broad implementation of road pricing in the long term.
Complementary VMT Reduction Incentives
The State should consider complementary VMT­reduction incentives, such as commuter choice,
location­efficient mortgages, and mileage­based (pay­as­you­drive) insurance.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.22 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.49 MMTCO2e in 2020
GHG reductions were calculated on the basis of a 3 percent reduction of passenger VMT below
the 2020 baseline, assuming a 1.5 percent reduction in 2010. The working group considered
several different data sources and calculations in developing the 3 percent estimate:
§ First, the working group considered the range of VMT savings from metropolitan
planning organization smart growth studies from around the country, which ranged from
1 to 14 percent below baseline projections, with most studies falling in the range of about
3 to 10 percent.33
§ Next, ConnDOT calculated that VMT reduction from doubling transit ridership would
result in a VMT reduction of about 1.6 percent in 2020 (425.5 million divided by 26.4
billion).

§

§

Concurrently, ConnDOT calculated that the VMT reduction from redirecting 25 percent
of new growth to urban areas would yield a VMT reduction of 0.5 percent. This modeling
did not capture VMT reductions from walking, biking, or reduced trip lengths (due to
closer origins and destinations).
Discussions with a national expert on transit and smart growth yielded a rough rule of
thumb that VMT reductions from walking and biking are approximately equal to VMT
reductions from transit under smart growth scenarios.

Combining all of this information, the working group agreed on 3 percent as a reasonable
estimate of VMT reductions from a package including transit, smart growth, and complementary
incentives. The working group noted that even greater VMT reductions may be available with
the introduction of road pricing on a large scale throughout the State.
Estimated Costs
Transit
ConnDOT calculated that the required transit investments would require approximately $1.8
billion in capital expenses and $110 million in annual operating expenses.
Smart Growth
The Transportation Strategy Board estimated a one­time capital cost of $10 million for State
assistance in GIS mapping and technical analyses and annual operating costs of $380,000 for
State assistance with municipal and regional plan development.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Avoided Infrastructure Costs
To the extent that future growth can be targeted to developed areas, costly infrastructure
investments can be avoided. Scarce resources can be used to repair and maintain existing
systems rather than extend them into sparsely populated, exurban areas. The Research Institute
for Housing America estimated the potential cost savings of smart growth measures nationally
could be as much as $250 billion over a 25­year period.34 If this nationwide estimate is
apportioned to Connecticut by population, the savings could approach $2.7 billion by 2025.
About 20 percent of the savings are road and land­use savings to State and local governments,
and about 80 percent of the savings are housing, development cost, and utility savings to
developers, home buyers, and commercial tenants.
Avoided Health Care Costs
An additional $3.1 million to $40.1 million in annual savings is expected from avoided health
care costs due to air pollution reductions (see below).35 The working group assumes a midpoint
of $21.6 million.

A 2000 analysis of household transportation expenditures in 28 metropolitan areas found that
transportation expenses are greater in low­density areas with few alternatives to the automobile.
The study found that families living in low­density areas pay roughly $1,300 more per year in
transportation expenses than families in compact, mixed­use areas do.36 If this savings is
assigned to the population shift associated with 25 percent penetration of smart growth measures
in Connecticut, it results in decreased transportation expenditures amounting to more than $28
million in 2020. Table 7.1 summarizes the costs and benefits annualized over 17 years using a 7
percent discount rate.
This set of smart growth, transit and VMT reduction measures results in an estimated
incremental cost of $602 per metric ton of CO2 direct cost to government (including capital and
operating costs) and $280 per metric ton of CO2 when cost savings are included: infrastructure
(pubic and private spending), health care, and household transportation expenditures.

Air Pollution Reductions
In Connecticut, mobile sources are responsible for the lion’s share of criteria and hazardous air
pollutant emissions. Health effects of these emissions include respiratory diseases, such as
asthma and bronchitis; cardiovascular disease; and premature death. Although difficult to
quantify, these emissions have real financial and social costs: treatment and hospitalizations for
pollution­induced illness, missed work and school days, restricted activity, coping with
symptoms of illness, and premature deaths.

Other Benefits
§ Increased transportation choices to the traveling public. In addition to fostering quality­
of­life improvements, increased travel choices can help relieve traffic congestion, bolster
economic development, and aid urban revitalization.
§ Health benefits from increased mobility. Auto­centric development patterns have
decreased mobility among adults and children, reducing opportunities for walking and
bike riding. The Surface Transportation Policy Project released a report this year
demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between sprawl, obesity, and
hypertension. Research suggests that people in compact, mixed­use areas reap benefits
from increased opportunities to integrate walking and biking into their everyday
routines.37 Smart growth seeks to encourage centralized, mixed­use communities with
well­developed pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. Given the myriad health costs
associated with inactivity, creating opportunities for increased mobility through smart
growth has a clear (although unquantified in this analysis) economic value.
§ Additional environmental benefits. Smart growth measures reduce the environmental
impact of development in other ways. Reduced impervious surfaces and improved water
detention safeguard water quality. A study of New Jersey’s Development and
Redevelopment Plan found that compact development would produce 40 percent less
water pollution than would more dispersed development patterns.38 Urban sprawl is
associated with habitat loss and habitat fragmentation, processes that can disrupt the
stability of Connecticut’s natural ecosystems. Clean up and reuse of brownfield sites is an
additional environmental benefit to smart growth.
§ Avoided costs of sprawl that can be minimized through smart growth policies include:
economic loss due to congestion, declining urban centers, disconnect between affordable
housing and job location, quality of life impacts.

8. Multistate Intermodal Freight Initiative
Recommended Action:

Embark upon a multistate intermodal freight initiative.

The Transportation and Land Use working group concluded that Connecticut can do little on its
own to foster intermodal freight transportation in the State (see the ConnDOT memo on
intermodal freight). Therefore, the stakeholders recommend that Connecticut engage in
multistate and regional discussions on opportunities to divert a portion of the projected 70
percent growth in regional truck traffic to rail and barge modes in order to reduce significantly
the GHG impact of freight transportation. Because of the structure of today’s freight networks,
the geographic scope would likely need to go beyond the Northeast (as far south as Virginia and
as far north as Halifax, Nova Scotia).
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.00 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.14 MMTCO2e in 2020
Key Assumptions
§
§

The modeling assumes that 5 percent of truck traffic shifts to rail or barge by 2020.
Beyond 2020, the potential exists for considerable GHG emissions reductions in
Connecticut and regionally, due to the creation of a more efficient, integrated, and diverse
freight network that has reduced reliance on trucks as the sole means of goods movement.

Estimated Costs
Cost estimates will depend on the selection, adoption, and level of implementation for low­GHG
freight policies.
Estimated Co-Benefits

9. Clean Diesel and Black Carbon
Recommended Action:

Reduce black carbon by establishing a Connecticut clean diesel
program.39

Scientists have identified black carbon, a component of particulate matter (PM, or soot), as
having a large and fast­acting warming impact on the atmosphere.40 Diesel engines emit roughly
half of the black carbon in the United States; the proportion may be lower in Connecticut,
depending on black carbon emissions from other sources.41 Thanks largely to tightening federal
standards for new engines, emission­control technology is now available to retrofit or rebuild
existing (“in­use”) engines for any kind of diesel engine (on­road, off­road, locomotive, and
marine).
The science of black carbon’s global warming potential is still evolving, and as it becomes more
precise, the calculations herein may need to be adjusted. Every effort was made to use conservative
assumptions about the level of black carbon emissions and reductions.
The recommendations herein summarize the strawman proposal on diesel black carbon prepared
by Environment Northeast. Refer to the transportation baseline section of this report and
Environment Northeast’s memo on diesel black carbon calculations for more information on how
the CO2 equivalency of black carbon was calculated.
The following stakeholder recommendations are based on a conservative set of assumptions,
regarding technology integration and black carbon reduction:
§
§
§

Include black carbon in the Connecticut GHG baseline. See baseline discussion.
Connecticut should recommend to the NEG/ECP that black carbon emissions be included in
GHG inventories and baselines.
Establish a Connecticut clean diesel program with the following characteristics:
­
Multi­agency program charged with maximizing diesel emission reductions
­
Design and implement programs and supporting regulations
­
Oversee revenue and expenditures earmarked for clean diesel program.

information for recommendations, costs and benefits in this section. Significant portions of this section are
excerpted verbatim from the Diesel Black Carbon strawman proposal.

See the introductory section to the report. The stakeholders have recommended that black carbon emissions from
other sources, such as residential boilers, be evaluated.

State Procurement
§
§

Construction contracts funded by the State should require best available control
technology (BACT) and other emissions­mitigation measures for all diesel engines.42
Connecticut Transit and ConnDOT: In the next three years, retrofit with BACT or
retire early all buses in the Connecticut transit fleets (500 or more buses); all 632 DOT
dump trucks and snow removal equipment; and all 131 diesel ground vehicles at Bradley
airport.

Incentives
Fuel
Consider the following measures:
§ Cut State sales tax on ultra­low­sulfur diesel fuel in order to reduce (or eliminate) the
incremental cost of this fuel until its use is federally required in June 2006.
§ Raise sales tax for on­road and off­road diesel fuel earmarked through the State
Transportation Fund to the clean diesel program for retrofits and early retirements.
Retrofit Emission Controls and Early Retirement/Replacement
Consider the following measures:
§ tax incentives for private sector purchase and installation of qualifying diesel emission
control technology
§ funding from Connecticut Clean Diesel Program to help defray costs of compliance
§ federal grants, earmarked fuel tax revenues, enforcement penalties, appropriations, user
fees, etc.
§ Interstate trucks
§ Establishment of a northeast regional program with NEG/ECP and/or Northeastern States
for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) to create a new incentive system to
promote BACT for in­use engines on long­haul, interstate trucks.
§ Anti­idling measures
§ Support capital expenditures to reduce truck, locomotive, and marine engine idling
through electrification and use of clean auxiliary engines.
Regulatory Support
§ Propose legislation directing DEP to establish phased­in emission standards requiring
BACT for particulates, black carbon, and NOx (as verified by EPA or CARB). The
legislation would target in­state trucks (garbage, snow removal, dump, and tanker),
school buses, transit and intercity buses, and construction equipment and would extend
anti­idling rules to locomotive and marine engines.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
Black Carbon Baseline
Developing an estimate of black carbon reductions requires development of a baseline emissions
forecast. In projected black carbon emissions, it is crucial to take into account federal regulations
42

See the key assumptions for discussion of BACT.

80



that will reduce black carbon emissions. Specifically, current EPA rules set standards for all new
on­road engines that will achieve 90 percent reductions in PM beginning in 2007. Pending EPA
rules are expected to require similar reductions for all new off­road engines that would be phased
in between 2008 and 2014. The working group developed the baseline to reflect the EPA rules
for new diesel vehicles, so that the black carbon policy recommendations would focus on
existing on­road and off­road vehicles.
Baseline levels of black carbon are projected to be 3.0 MMTCO2e in 1990 and 3.7 MMTCO2e in
2010 and 2020. Refer to the transportation baseline section of this report and Environment
Northeast’s memo on diesel black carbon calculations for more information on how the black
carbon was determined.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.80 MMTCO2e in 2010
2.40 MMTCO2e in 2020
Key Assumptions
§

§
§

§

§

The working group assumed that by 2020, the technical potential will exist to achieve
100 percent penetration of emission­control technology in pre­EPA­rule on­road and off­
road vehicles, which on average would achieve 90 percent lower PM emissions than in
2000.
As a conservative estimate, penetration rates of 25 percent in 2010 and 75 percent in
2020 were assumed.
The working group did not “take credit” in its reduction calculations for any purchases of
“new” engines that comply with the federal on­road or proposed off­road rules unless
those purchases were made before the end of the engine’s useful life as a result of State
policies.
For purposes of this discussion, BACT refers to equipment that is commercially available
and achieves the highest amount of emission reductions at practical costs for a given
engine type and use. For high­operating­temperature engines beginning with model year
1994, BACT represents the diesel particulate filters (DPFs) that achieve at least 90
percent black carbon reductions. DPFs capture diesel particulates before they are
discharged from the tailpipe into the ambient air. For pre­1994 engines and low­
operating­temperature engines (in which DPFs may not be practical), the working group
assumed the use of alternative controls, including high­performance diesel­oxidation
catalysts (DOCs), which oxidize diesel particles to prevent harmful emissions
components and achieve better than 50 percent reductions in particulate matter and 25
percent reductions in black carbon. Although standard DOCs remove about 25 percent of
particulate matter, they do not remove black carbon or NOx and thus do not have climate
benefits.
For engines too old to warrant the expense of retrofits or those that cannot be retrofitted,
the options are to accelerate early retirement and replacement with new, low­emission
engines (which in the case of a new on­road truck would deliver greater than 99 percent

81



reductions in PM and black carbon) or to minimize operation of those engines through a
combination of anti­idling programs, electrification, and clean auxiliary power units. The
combination of those measures will give Connecticut the technical potential of achieving
90 percent reductions from present­level black carbon emissions by 2020.
Estimated Costs
The working group did not have comprehensive cost data or complete data on the inventory of
diesel vehicles operating in Connecticut. However, it was able to develop the following cost
estimates. The working group also noted that as technology evolves, emissions­control
technology costs are likely to drop. For more details, see the strawman proposal.
§

§

§

§

Ultra­low­sulfur diesel fuel (ULSD), which contains less than 30 ppm sulfur, costs
anywhere from $0.05 to $0.15 per gallon more than regular diesel. It is a prerequisite for
proper operation of most DPF systems. Existing facilities can be used, but use of ULSD
requires dedicated shipping and storage facilities so that it is not contaminated by higher
sulfur fuels.
DPF retrofit packages currently cost between $4,500 and $9,000 per unit for an average
truck or bus. Transit buses would be on the lower end of this scale. For large construction
engines such as front­end loaders, the filters can cost as much as $12,000. The cost varies
with the size of the engine and the volume of the purchase.
Alternative retrofittable controls, such as the recently commercialized Particulate
Reactor, cut PM by 50 to 60 percent and cut black carbon by around 25 percent, on
average. Costs vary by size of the engine; for a standard transit bus, they would be
between $3,000 and $3,500. The units do not require the use of low­sulfur fuel.
Maintenance for retrofit emission controls is very low. DPFs (in the muffler) should be
removed, cleaned, and reinstalled annually.

The following cost estimates were developed for several categories of vehicles.
§

Transit Buses (ConnDOT): $1.6 million to $7.0 million
­
183 “young” Connecticut Transit buses @ $5,000 = $915,000

§

Perhaps the most uncertain cost component is that of replacement costs for buses and trucks. It is
assumed that vehicle replacement would not require the full vehicle purchase price but a partial
cost of $10,000 to $50,000 per vehicle.
Accepting the cost assumptions, along with the other projections regarding the cooling impact of
black carbon and the penetration rates of retrofits, then the cost of carbon reductions from this
measure would be in the range of $6 to $13 per MTCO2e. Using these assumptions, levelized
annual costs would range from $13 million to $30 million.43 Note that the cost assumptions do
not include reduced health care costs resulting from lowered PM emissions.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Health and climate objectives are advanced with immediate effect, including avoidance of:
premature death, asthma and asthma attacks, emergency room visits, heart disease, and cancer
associated with risk of exposure to diesel toxic emissions. Note that the cost assumptions above do
not include reduced health care costs resulting from lowered PM emissions.
Progress – In Process
181 school buses in New Haven are being retrofitted with diesel oxidation catalysts and Spiracle
crankcase controls. These buses are now being fueled with ultra­low sulfur diesel fuel that is
dosed with a fuel borne catalyst to further reduce emissions.
The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection is in the process of updating fleet
information for the Hartford and Bridgeport school bus fleets to determine engine types and
operating temperatures as these parameters effect the control technology determinations.
About two years ago the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection established a
voluntary partnership with the Department of Transportation and CCIA to explore the feasibility
of including construction retrofits as part of the I­95 Quinnipiac Bridge reconstruction project.
To date, 72 pieces of equipment have been retrofitted with diesel oxidation catalysts for both
Contract C1 and Contract D. Through this partnership, a contract specification was developed
which requires “all diesel powered construction equipment with engine horsepower (HP) rating
of 60 HP and above, that are on the project in excess of 30 days to be retrofitted with Emission
Control Devices and/or use clean fuels in order to reduce diesel emissions.”

10. Appliance Standards
Recommended Action:

Establish efficiency standards for appliances.

The State should set efficiency standards for eight appliances that are commercially available
and do not require a federal waiver for state regulation. Those appliances include dry­type
transformers, commercial refrigerators and freezers, exit signs, traffic signals, torchière lamps,
packaged large A/C units greater than 20 tons, unit heaters, and commercial clothes washers
(Table 10.1). Appliances at the proposed efficiency level are commercially available.

Estimated GHG emissions reduction:
0.104 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.205 MMTCO2e in 2020
The savings estimates are based on a study by the Northeast Energy Efficiency Partnership
(NEEP). NEEP disaggregated a national study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient
Economy (ACEEE) and allocated fractions of the estimated energy and peak­demand savings
from efficiency standards to individual states by applying state allocation factors. The analysis is
static and assumes that equipment sales remain at 2000 levels for all products. In the absence of
standards, efficiency levels remain at present levels. In actuality, product sales and efficiency are
gradually increasing, even in the absence of standards. Thus, NEEP’s study implicitly assumed
that those factors counterbalance each other (NEEP, 2003).
The appliance standards will reduce primarily indirect emissions; minor direct emissions savings
will come from unit heaters. Estimates are shown in Table 10.2.

Estimated Costs
Levelized annual costs, based on the NEEP study, were estimated as –$106/tCO2. This estimate
accounts for the incremental cost of higher efficiency appliances and the cost savings associated
with reduced energy consumption.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Co­benefits were not quantified, but they include (1) reduced hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) and
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions due to leaks from commercial refrigerators and freezers and
AC and (2) reduced water consumption from commercial clothes washers.
Progress – In Process
Legislation enacted to require DPUC, in consultation with OPM, to establish regulations for
energy efficiency standards for a variety of heating, cooling and other types of products (Public
Act 04­85). The DPUC, in consultation with OPM is currently conducting an administrative
proceeding to adopt regulations regarding the certification of designated products, procedures for
testing the energy efficiency of products, and the manner in which an annual list of qualified
products will be published and maintained (DPUC Docket #04­10­18).

11. Appliance-Swapping Program
Recommended Action:

Create an appliance-swapping program.

Develop a “pay­as­you­save” program under the Conservation and Load Management Fund to
replace old appliances in the residential sector with new Energy Star appliances. Appliances to
be covered include Energy Star Tumble Clothes Washer, Energy Star Refrigerator, Energy Star
Room A/C (6500 BTU), and Energy Star Dishwasher.

The DPUC forwarded this item to the Energy Conservation Management Board (ECMB) for its
review and consideration for possible inclusion in its draft 2005 C&LM budget plan (7/04). The
ECMB conducted a preliminary review of this item, and has provided initial commentary to the
DPUC (10/04). The DPUC is currently conducting an administrative proceeding to approve the
2005 C&LM budget, and it intends to further examine the feasibility of including this item in the

12. Heat Pump Water Heater Replacement Program
Recommended Action:

Create a heat pump water heater (HPWH) replacement program.

Develop a pay­as­you­save program under the Conservation and Load Management Fund
(C&LM) to promote the WatterSaver, the next generation of heat pump water heater (HPWH)
technology. By utilizing the ambient air, the WatterSaver attains an efficiency rating nearly three
times that of the most efficient electric water heaters. This technology is projected to be
commercially available in 2004.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.011 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.013 MMTCO2e in 2020
The GHG emissions were estimated by multiplying the annual electric savings associated with
the WatterSaver by the number of units replaced each year by the marginal CO2 emission factor
for the regional electricity grid. The annual electric energy savings for the WatterSaver HPWH is
estimated to be 2400kWh/yr/unit, compared with the current state­of­the­art electric hot water
heaters. It was estimated that this technology will achieve a 0.5 percent annual market
penetration during the first five years following commercialization in 2004, or approximately
1,350 units per year in Connecticut.
The GHG emission reductions from this measure are indirect emissions from decreased
electricity consumption (Table 12.1).

In addition to improving the efficiency of water heating, this appliance has also demonstrated the
co­benefit of dehumidifying the space where it is located.

13. Bulk Purchasing of Appliances
Recommended Action:

Create a program for bulk purchasing of appliances.

This program consists of two components:
1. Promote the Consortium for Energy Efficiency’s (CEE’s) residential­sector bulk­purchasing
program in Connecticut along with other states in the region. The program covers apartment­
sized refrigerators, large refrigerators, subcompact fluorescents, reflector compact
fluorescent lights, dedicated compact fluorescent recessed light fixtures, and heat pump water
heaters.
2. Promote Pacific Northwest National Laboratory’s (PNNL’s) commercial­sector bulk­
purchasing program in Connecticut and in other states in the region. This program covers
unitary rooftop air conditioning products in the 65,000 to 135,000 Btu/h cooling capacity
range.
Technology Bulk Procurement is a method for pulling new highly efficient and affordable
products into the marketplace through competitive procurements that are backed by large volume
buyers.

The GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the annual unit savings (kWh) for the appliance
by the number of appliances sold annually under the program by the marginal CO2 emission
factor for the regional electricity grid. Data were not available to estimate savings for all
appliances under the program. The appliances for which data were available are listed in Table

14. Mandate Upgrades to Residential and Commercial Building Energy
Codes
Recommended Action: Upgrade residential and commercial building energy codes.1
The State should adopt the latest Energy Code from the International Code Council (ICC) by
July 2004 and require the automatic adoption of updated revisions within 18 months as they
become available for both residential and commercial buildings. Current State law requires the
State Building Code (Code) to be updated to incorporate any “necessary” revisions adopted by
the ICC. The stated purposes of the Code include conserving energy and facilitating the use of
renewable resources.
Conn. Gen. Stat. § 29­252 incorporates energy conservation provisions and is based on the 1996
building code developed by a predecessor of the ICC. The adoption of subsequent revisions in
Connecticut has been delayed, in part, by a dispute over whether the International Fire Code
should be adopted for certain provisions (mostly unrelated to energy) in place of the existing
National Fire Protection Association Code. The State Codes and Standards Committee and the
Department of Public Safety are in the process of reviewing and considering updated commercial
and residential codes that could be adopted by July 2004.
The most up­to­date revision of the ICC codes, including the International Building Code and the
International Energy Conservation Code, occurred in 2003. Many other states, including New
Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, use the ICC codes. Adoption of the
updated ICC Building, Energy and Fire codes has been endorsed by key officials of the
Department of Public Safety, including the State Building Inspector; the Codes and Standards
Committee; and the Coalition for the Adoption of a Unified Code, which includes organizations
representing architects and construction trades.
Connecticut can ensure that efficiency standards keep pace with evolving technology by
requiring that revisions to the International Energy Conservation Code be adopted (without
additional legislative action) within 18 months after they become available. This would not
require changing the existing flexibility for adopting more complex building and fire codes.
The State of Connecticut should work with the insurance industry to encourage and enforce

1

The upgrade residential and commercial building energy code strawman proposal, prepared by Environment
Northeast, is the primary source of information on the upgraded residential and commercial building code
recommendations. Significant portions of this section are excerpted verbatim from the upgrade residential and
commercial building codes strawman proposal and the full strawman proposal is available in the RCI
Assumptions Document (October 30, 2003).

increased energy efficiency and mitigation of GHG emissions in commercial, institutional, and
residential buildings, through improvements and changes to the State’s building codes. The State
should encourage the insurance industry to identify changes needed in the building code that will
result in reduced fire and safety losses while addressing energy efficiency and conservation (i.e.,
similar to what was done with torchiere lamps).
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.057 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.212 MMTCO2e in 2020
These GHG savings only represent savings associated with upgrading the residential building
code. Savings associated with upgrading commercial buildings were not estimated because data
were not available. GHG savings for the residential building code upgrade were estimated by
multiplying the electricity, gas, and oil savings per household by the number of new homes built
that comply with the ICC standard by the appropriate GHG emission factor. Based on a study
that looked at upgrading residential building codes in Massachusetts (XENERGY, 2001), it was
assumed that upgrading the codes would result in the average home achieving a 1.1 percent
savings in electricity and a 13.7 percent or 18.4 percent savings in oil or natural gas, respectively,
depending on the home heating fuel. It was assumed that 70 percent of new homes comply with
the new standard. It was also assumed that new codes would be developed every three years and
adopted by the State within two years.
It is estimated that both direct and indirect emission reductions will be achieved through this
measure, as detailed in Table 14.1.

15. Promote Energy Efficient and Energy Improvement Mortgages
Recommended Action:

Promote energy efficient and energy improvement mortgages.

This measure is targeted at increasing the awareness of financial products that can encourage
people to purchase energy efficient homes and includes the following activities:
§

§

§
§

§

Actively promote EE mortgages (EEMs) in Connecticut. The current EEM allows
homebuyers to purchase Energy Star homes that might have cost more than they would
have qualified to borrow. In its initial form, the EEM was a straight 2 percent stretch that
allowed the buyers of EE homes to qualify for up to 2 percent more debt because of their
lowered monthly utility costs.
Work with the Connecticut Housing and Finance Authority (CHFA), Fannie Mae, and
others to develop an energy improvement mortgage (EIM), and then actively promote
this product in Connecticut.2 EIMs target homeowners who purchase existing homes or
are making upgrades to their current home. This program would help finance EE
improvements on existing homes, such as upgrading to efficient furnaces and adding
insulation. Because most of the housing stock in Connecticut was built before 1960, this
measure is likely to have a large impact if homeowners take advantage of it. This
program has worked best when a home energy rating system (HERS) is available to
document the relative efficiency of a home.
Work with CHFA, Fannie Mae, and others to develop a “smart­commute mortgage,” and
then actively promote it in Connecticut.
The State of Connecticut should work with the insurance and banking industries, as well
as with home inspectors, to identify safety and EE measures that may mitigate GHG
emissions. These measures can be addressed during real estate sales and affect insurance
and bank products and services.
The State should work with the Connecticut home inspectors trade association to provide
information on energy efficiency and energy audits. It could develop or collect existing
materials that deal with efficient appliances, heating and cooling systems, water heaters,
and other home energy savings ideas that inspectors can distribute during home
inspections.

0.005 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.014 MMTCO2e in 2020
GHG savings are only estimated for EIMs. GHG savings associated with the EEMs were not
estimated because it was assumed that those savings would be accounted for under the Energy
Star Homes Program. In other words, promotion of EEMs would lead to an increased
participation in the Energy Star Homes Program. Data on smart­commute mortgages were not
available for this exercise; therefore, the estimates below do not include savings associated with
that type of product.
GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the electricity, gas, and oil savings per home by the
number of new homes participating in the EIM program by the appropriate GHG emission factor
(Table 15.1). Electricity savings were estimated to be 3 percent whereas fossil fuel savings were
estimated to be up to 39 percent, which is based on data from an EIM program administered in
Vermont. Participation in the program was estimated to be 0.5 percent of residential resale in
Connecticut in the first five years and 1 percent in the subsequent years.

on the costs associated with the Vermont program and the cost savings associated with the
reduced energy consumption.
Estimated Co-Benefits
EIMs represents an untapped tool that could potentially reduce energy consumption and GHG
emissions while creating more affordable homes. They could also facilitate community
revitalization by helping U.S. consumers access capital; improving the energy efficiency of
existing housing stock; and helping communities retain conserved energy dollars in the local
economy.

16. Revise the Energy Conservation Loan Program
Recommended Action: Revise the current Energy Conservation Loan Program (ECL).
The State should improve the current ECL program, which provides low­interest loans (with the
interest rate based on income) for EE improvements and is run by the Department of Economic
and Community Development. The total annual savings from the existing ECL program is
approximately 790,533,000 BTUs; the average cost of $875,000/year is based on the past two
years. Approximately 70 percent of the money went for “energy saving” measures, 30 percent of
the dollars went to energy­related but “non­energy saving” measures.

17. Weatherization Assistance Program
Recommended Action:

Expand weatherization program.

The State should provide funding to double the amount of households served under the Federal
Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), which targets low­income households for
comprehensive weatherization. The current WAP program covers between 700 and 1000 housing
units per year at a cost of $2,400 to $3,000 per unit.

Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.006 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.006 MMTCO2e in 2020
The GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the electricity and fossil fuel savings per home
times the number of homes participating in the program by the appropriate GHG emission factor.
The savings were based on an Oak Ridge National Laboratory study (ORNL, 1994 ) that
estimated weatherization savings to be, on average, 13.5 percent, including both electricity and
fossil fuel. It was estimated that savings would persist for five years and that an additional 840
homes could be served, compared with the existing program. Estimates for direct and indirect
emissions are shown in Table 17.1.

annual average of 700 to 1,000 homes completed over the 2001–2003 period (DSS, 2003). The
annual levelized annual costs are estimated to be $265/tCO2. This estimate also accounts for the
cost savings associated with reduced energy consumption.

18. Energy Star Homes Program
Recommended Action:

Double participation in the Energy Star Homes Program

This program would expand rebates under the Conservation and Load Management Fund to
double participation in the Energy Star Homes program (for new construction only). The current
Energy Star homes program targets approximately 15 percent of new homes at an estimated cost
of $1,800 to $4,700, depending on the measures implemented. In addition, Connecticut should
stay abreast of developments of the United States Green Building Council (USGBC), which is in
the early stages of developing a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design)
standard for residential homes. Although the standard will not be finalized for three to five years,
when it is available, Connecticut should review and determine if it should be actively promoted.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.018 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.044 MMTCO2e in 2020
The GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the average savings of electricity and fossil fuel
use for an Energy Star home compared with an average home by the number of new Energy Star
homes built by the appropriate GHG emission factor (Table 18.1). Energy Star­qualified homes
incorporate savings in design and construction and, in Connecticut, use approximately 15 percent
less energy for heating, cooling, water heating, lighting, and appliances than a standard home.
The number of new homes in Connecticut is expected to be between 8,300 and 8,900 over the
next five years.

Estimated Costs
The incremental cost to build Energy Star homes varies greatly; it depends on the house size, the
region, and the prevailing construction practices in the region. The average incremental cost is
$2,150. A few homes cost more; occasionally, an Energy Star­labeled home can actually be less

101



expensive to build than its non­Energy Star counterpart (i.e., good insulation, high­performance
windows, tight infiltration, and elimination of duct leakage can lower the heating and cooling
load so much that smaller and less expensive HVAC equipment and more compact duct runs are
able to be installed, saving significant first costs) (EPA, 2003). Based on the incremental cost
and the cost savings associated with reduced energy consumption, levelized annual costs were
estimated to be –$3/tCO2.
Estimated Co-Benefits

19. High-Performance Schools and State-Funded Buildings
Recommended Action:

Require high-performance buildings for schools and other Statefunded projects.

This program would mandate high­performance energy requirements for State­funded buildings,
including State facilities and local schools, as follows:
§

§

§

New construction and major renovations of all building projects that receive some State
funding (State facilities, local schools, etc.) must meet LEED standards and certify with
the U.S. Green Buildings Council (USGBC). Although LEED identifies several building
areas, the Energy and Atmosphere and the Indoor Environmental Quality areas have a
significant GHG emissions impact. It is anticipated that these areas will be a strong focus
for new buildings because they have a good payback and are easy to accomplish. After
2010, the State should consider requiring a higher level of LEED (e.g., silver, gold, or
platinum). This requirement can be achieved through legislation, executive order, or the
bonding process. The State will also need to provide education and outreach to towns, the
Connecticut Department of Education, and others, so that they become familiar with
LEED standards as well as the benefits (USGBC, 2003a,b,c).
Small construction and renovation projects that use State funding should also be required
to meet a high­performance building standard. Connecticut should not require LEED but
should develop standards for small projects and mandate that they be met. This approach
would be an alternative to the formal USGBC LEED process, which is often not
supported by small project budgets. The Connecticut Department of Public Works
(DPW) has begun to develop these standards and may initiate a pilot project in the near
future. Some LEED principles could serve as an informal guide. For example,
Connecticut could require expert review early in the design process for small projects.
This approach can be achieved through legislation, executive order, or the bonding
process.
Existing State buildings and space leased to the State should also be required to meet
certain energy standards. USGBC is piloting a new program, LEED for existing
buildings, which will most likely be final in 2004. This certification program will
examine ongoing maintenance and operations of building systems. Optimizing energy
efficiency, renewable energy, and continual commissioning are included in the draft
checklist. Once final, this program should be evaluated and, if appropriate, be promoted
for private and public buildings. Certification with the USGBC could be optional, but the
elements of the certification could be adopted independent of the actual certification
process. This approach can be achieved through legislation or executive order.

103



§

§

USGBC is developing a LEED program aimed at tenant space (LEED for Commercial
Interiors). It is anticipated that this program may be final by late 2004 at the earliest. This
program focuses on the core and shell of buildings. Low­emitting materials and other
environmentally preferable products are included in the draft checklist. Once final, this
program perhaps should be evaluated and, if appropriate, be promoted for private and
public buildings that are leased. Certification with the USGBC could be optional, but the
elements of the certification could be adopted independent of the actual certification
process. This approach can be achieved through legislation or executive order.
Provide recognition for projects that go beyond LEED certification. Currently, DEP’s
Green Circle Award is given for LEED­certified projects.

The State of Connecticut should work with the insurance industry to encourage it to identify
green building measures that also decrease risk and liability. The insurance industry can leverage
green building measures in their products (e.g., using renewables like solar can reduce fire and
safety liability associated with current energy systems).
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.017 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.058 MMTCO2e in 2020
The GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the square footage of new State­funded
buildings achieving LEED by the incremental electricity and fossil fuel savings associated with
LEED by the appropriate GHG emission factor. The energy savings are based on experience
with LEED buildings showing that it is relatively straightforward to achieve 20 to 30 percent
reductions compared with the 1989 ICC building code standard. This savings translates into 15
to 25 percent compared with the 1999 or 2001 ICC building code standard (Steven Winters
Associates, 2003). It was estimated that approximately 1.5 million square feet of qualifying
buildings would be built each year. Emission reductions will include both direct and indirect
emission reductions, as shown in Table 19.1.

Estimated Costs
Although many green buildings can be constructed at a cost comparable to or lower than that of
conventional buildings, an estimate average of a 2% increase in initial costs is possible. These
costs could be recouped in a relatively short time period. Given the incremental cost and the cost

104



savings associated with reduced energy consumption, annual levelized costs for this measure
were estimated to be $464/tCO2.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Numerous co­benefits are associated with implementing LEED. In addition to promoting energy
efficiency and renewable energy, LEED promotes sustainable site planning, safeguarding water
and water efficiency, conserving materials and resources, and improving indoor environmental
quality. In addition to environmental benefits, LEED offers economic benefits, health and safety
benefits, and community benefits. Savings associated with these benefits were not quantified.
Heschong Mahone Group (1999) found that well­designed high performance schools with
daylighting correlated with improved student test scores. In addition, high performance building
practices enhance acoustics, creating a better learning environment. Finally, the use of products
with lower levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) should reduce the potential for “sick
building syndrome” and create a better working and learning environment for employees,
teachers, and students.
Progress – In Process
The Office of Policy and Management (OPM) held a public education seminar in October 2004
on high performance schools, and is planning another for 2005, to be held under the auspices of
Rebuild America.
The Connecticut Green Building Council is planning to put together a report on high
performance green schools in Connecticut. This nonprofit organization intends to initiate a
public process to identify the opportunities and barriers with high performance green schools in
Connecticut. It is anticipated that this report will be complete by the end of 2005.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation:
§ Consider legislation mandating state­funded projects meet particular green building
standards.
§ Consider requiring the Department of Education to evaluate all school projects for
meeting green building standards.

20. High-Performance Buildings: Privately Funded Projects
Recommended Action:

Encourage high-performance buildings in privately funded
projects.

This recommendation includes the following measures:
§
§
§
§
§
§

Encourage privately financed new construction and renovation to be high­performance
buildings by certifying LEED standards.
Encourage privately occupied existing buildings and leased space to be high­performing
(using future USGBC LEED programs or other programs to be determined).
Provide tax credits and other financial incentives for green buildings, similar to those
offered in New York and Massachusetts.
Provide awards program to recognize LEED buildings or use other measure to determine
high performance.
Work with lending institutions and insurers to identify incentives that they could offer for
high­performance buildings (i.e., preferred rates, utilizing lifecycle costs)
Encourage municipalities to promote LEED or other high­performance standard for
projects within their jurisdiction that require local review.

The State of Connecticut should work with the insurance industry to encourage them to identify
green building measures that also decrease risk and liability and to leverage their use in
insurance products (e.g., using renewables like solar, could reduce fire and safety liability
associated with current energy systems).
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable):
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.019 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.052 MMTCO2e in 2020
The GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the square footage of new high­performance
buildings by the incremental electricity and fossil fuel savings, by the appropriate GHG emission
factor. The energy savings are based on experience with LEED buildings showing that it is
relatively straightforward to achieve 20 to 30 percent reductions compared with the 1989 ICC
building code standard. This savings translates into 15 to 25 percent compared with the 1999 or
2001 ICC building code standard (Steven Winters Associates, 2003). It was estimated that
approximately 1.2 million square feet per year would be built under this program. Emission
reductions will include both direct and indirect emission reductions, as shown in Table 20.1.

While advancing the LEED standard is currently not addressing privately owned buildings,
progress is being made to address that sector in other ways. Through a grant from US DOE’s
Rebuild America program and funding provided by the State’s electric utilities through the
C&LM fund, privately owned commercial buildings in SW CT are being benchmarked. A
subset of these buildings will undergo retro­commissioning, (the process of evaluating the
building’s systems to ensure that the building is operating as was originally intended when
designed and built). The project will also include training facility managers, providing
education, and development of case studies and other tools to permit easy replication of the
project in other regions of the state.

21. Shared Savings Program for Government Agencies
Recommended Action:

Revise the shared savings program for government agencies.

The State should revise the program referenced in CGS 16a­37c so that savings are claimed
under more controlled terms and the program is workable within the OPM budget. It should then
promote its use by State agencies. In addition, the State should review the Federal Energy
Management Program (FEMP) Super Energy Savings Performance Contracts program and
consider adopting a similar program for Connecticut State agencies. A portion of the savings
should go toward the purchase of green power for State agencies.
In addition to the shared savings program, a joint program to provide technical assistance to
benchmark all qualifying State facilities in Connecticut over the next 5 years is recommended.
This program will provide valuable information to the State during this period of budget crises
and cost containment.

Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.124 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.198 MMTCO2e in 2020
These savings were based on the assumption that State buildings can reduce energy use by 20
percent in 2010 and 35 percent in 2020. OPM has provided energy use data for State government
facilities. The data include annual use by agency for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. State energy
consumption was estimated to grow at the same rate as total State energy consumption: 1.1
percent. This measure will result in both direct and indirect emission reductions (Table 21.1).

22. Training of Building Operators
Recommended Action:

Train building operators to use maintenance approaches that
improve energy efficiency.

Ramp up existing Connecticut training programs to serve a larger number of building operators
(including maintenance technicians, lead custodians, maintenance foremen, and plant engineers),
who typically have little formal training in building efficiency. Currently, Connecticut Light &
Power (CL&P) and United Illuminating (UI) offer training courses for building operators that are
funded in part by the Conservation & Load Management Fund. Participants pay a fee to enter.
Sessions are approximately once per month; maximum participation is 30 students. As a result of
the great interest from building operators, the program is oversubscribed. The training includes
such topics as where to find and how to use building codes; how to read utility meters and bills;
how to maximize heating, ventilation, and air conditioning controls; when to call for help; and
how to improve a host of other operation and maintenance techniques.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.032 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.033 MMTCO2e in 2020
GHG savings were estimated by multiplying the number of students trained per year by the
average annual electricity and fossil fuel savings per student by the appropriate GHG emission
factor (Table 22.1). These average annual energy savings were based on average savings
reported from program evaluation (NEEP, 2002), including electricity savings of 238,500 kWh
per student, and fossil fuel savings of 930 MMBtu per student. Savings are expected to be
generated in the year after training and last for only 5 years.

23. Green Campus Initiative
Recommended Action:

Promote a “green campus initiative” with Connecticut institutions
of higher learning and secondary schools.3

Promote a “green campus initiative” with all Connecticut colleges, universities, and private and
secondary schools to minimize environmental impact and create “learning labs” for
sustainability. This program would develop and support an effective process to promote energy
and environmental sustainability with Connecticut educational institutions. The program would
provide leadership and resources to engage schools and interest them in taking a comprehensive
approach to lowering energy use and cost, reducing GHGs from building systems and
transportation, improving water and wastewater management, increasing recycling, reducing the
need for hazardous waste disposal, and promoting procurement of environmentally friendly
products. The program would use a team­based approach that engaged administrative staff,
students, faculty, and technical experts.
The program would be implemented over the course of five years in Connecticut’s 48 colleges
and universities. The measures could be funded through the Connecticut Conservation and Load
Management Fund, the proposed “oil and natural gas conservation fund,” or the Connecticut
Clean Energy Fund. In addition, financing for comprehensive renovation programs could be
made available through performance contracts by energy service companies.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.183 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.190 MMTCO2e in 2020
Energy savings (Table 23.1) were estimated using the Department of Energy’s “Energy Smart
Guide to Campus Cost Savings.” An average potential cost reduction of 35 percent and 25
percent for electric savings and fossil fuels savings, respectively, was estimated. Savings were
calculated using regional­average data for three categories of schools (savings per student), and
the number and student enrollment of Connecticut colleges and universities.

The green campus initiatives strawman proposal, prepared by the Institute for Sustainable Energy, is the primary
source of information on the green campus initiatives recommendations, costs, and benefits. Significant portions of
this section are excerpted verbatim from the green campus initiative strawman proposal, and the full strawman
proposal is available in the RCI Assumptions Document (October 30, 2003).

The square footage of and actual energy bills for Connecticut colleges and universities are not
currently available. Energy­use projections were calculated using DOE regional inventory data
on costs per student and applying those values to the “full­time equivalent” student enrollment in
Connecticut colleges and universities, as provided by the U.S. Department of Education. It was
estimated that 20 percent of the market would be enrolled in the program each year.

The cost of the energy savings measures were not estimated.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Additional environmental benefits, which were not quantified, will be derived beyond energy
conservation by instituting improved recycling, sustainable­purchasing policies, new building
design, water conservation, and other activities outlined above. See stakeholder report appendix
for more details.
Progress – In Process
During the past year considerable activity has occurred 1) 17 Connecticut universities have

24. Energy Benchmarking and Tracking Program for Municipal
Buildings
Recommended Action:

Promote energy measurement, tracking, benchmarking, and
strategic planning with municipal facilities.4

This program would promote energy measurement, tracking, benchmarking, and strategic
planning with municipal facilities, including public schools, to increase their participation in
existing and new energy conservation and environmental programs and raise their energy
efficiency and Energy Star level. It would involve creating a program that engages communities
in developing energy­sustainability plans and implementing those plans by measuring, tracking,
and assessing their current efficiency levels. Communities also would use existing energy
conservation and environmental programs to improve targeted inefficient municipal facilities.
The program would include the following components:
§
§
§

§

Energy and emission inventory and measurement, including benchmarking and ongoing
tracking of municipal office buildings and schools
Identification and ranking of inefficient facilities and development of a strategic plan for
improving energy efficiency to Energy Star performance levels
Prescriptive solutions, such as coordinating participation in existing State, federal, and
utility conservation programs; changing local public policy; providing energy education
for better understanding of energy, environmental, and cost­reduction issues and options;
enhanced energy management and ongoing energy accounting and monitoring to achieve
reduction of energy costs in public buildings; addressing difficult environmental issues;
and providing energy education for department heads and maintenance staff
Energy and environmental education programs throughout the public schools.

The proposed program is estimated to be implemented over the next five years. It will target 169
towns incorporating 161 secondary schools, 170 middle or junior high schools, 654 elementary
schools, and more than 500 municipal office buildings. Funding for retrofits for electric saving
measures could come from the Conservation and Load Management Fund. Funding for retrofits
to fossil­fueled building systems should be included in the proposed natural gas and oil

conservation funds. Total building renovation for energy performance improvements and
building envelope improvements can be financed by municipal bonds, performance contracts, or
the proposed pay­as­you­save strategy.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.119 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.190 MMTCO2e in 2020
Annual energy savings are estimated to be 20 percent in Year 5 and 35 percent in Year 10 (Table
24.1). Savings would be derived from both electric efficiency improvements and fossil fuel
equipment upgrades. It was estimated that public schools represent the greatest opportunity for
savings in this sector. Savings were estimated using 2003 Connecticut Department of Education
data on total schools by type and total students by grade level. The estimate was extrapolated on
a cost per student basis using a representative sample of 30 schools benchmarked in 2003.
Savings projections were estimated using EPA Energy Star Portfolio Manager Benchmarking
and the DOE High­Performance Schools manuals.
A comparable levels of savings can be achieved in the 500 or so Connecticut public buildings,
including town office buildings, police stations, fire stations, recreation centers, senior citizens
centers, and libraries. However, data for projection are not readily available, so those estimates
were not included here.

25. Pilot Fuel-Switching Project
Recommended Action:

Implement a pilot fuel-switching project.

In Year 1, the State should undertake a pilot project for B20 biodiesel blend for heating
applications at two State facilities (i.e., one State university campus and one State office facility).
The pilot facilities will be determined with the assistance of DPW. Assuming the pilot project
proves the fuel to be acceptable, the State should begin to require additional State buildings to
use B20 in Year 2 and beyond. The State should also consider promoting the use of B20 for
heating applications beyond State facilities (e.g., to the general public, private institutions).
The State should also consider promoting biodiesel in marine vehicles, such as boats and ferries
provided air quality issues are not a concern and availability is possible. Government­operated
marine vehicles could be required to use B20.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
<0.001 MMTCO2e in 2010
<0.001 MMTCO2e in 2020
The GHG savings were estimated by calculating the GHG emissions of two State facilities
(assuming heating oil is burned) and subtracting the GHG emissions of two State facilities
(assuming B20 is burned) (Table 25.1). It was assumed that additional buildings would switch in
2006 and in 2011 following positive results of the pilot program.

Although using biodiesel in transportation emissions has been associated with increased NOx
emissions, this is not the case with the stationary application of this fuel.
Costs to do a one­year pilot project at ECSU are estimated to be about $40,000, which includes
emissions testing.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Co­benefits have not been analyzed, however reduced particulate matter could have positive
impacts on public health.
Progress – In Process
Funding has been identified to begin a pilot project utilizing a B20 blend (20% biodiesel blended
with 80% #2 fuel oil) for space heating for one year. The pilot, which will commence in early
2005, will identify all regulatory steps needed for a facility to use biodiesel (i.e., permit
modifications), gather data on fuel efficiency and emissions factors and monitor air emissions
associated with using a B20 blend, test fuel quality, impacts on equipment (maintenance and
performance satisfaction), and costs. Eastern Connecticut State University, South Campus is the
site for the pilot; between 12,500 – 21,000 gallons of fuel would be utilized during the pilot
project, 20% of which would be biodiesel.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation
§ Develop a work plan, authorize a Public Service Agreement (PSA) between CT DEP and
ECSU, contract for fuel and other services in order to begin pilot.
§ Review results at end of pilot (approximately 15 months from start date).
§ Initially select projects that provide distributed generation sized to satisfy the need and
are below de minimis levels needed for environmental review.
§ If results of pilot are positive, consider expansion within context of permitting
requirements.
§ Budgetary concerns will need to be addressed if increased fuel costs for biodiesel blend.

26. Remove Current Barriers to
Third-Party Load-Management Techniques
Recommended Action:

Remove current barriers to third-party load-management
techniques.5

The State should overcome existing regulatory barriers that prohibit the increased market
diffusion of third­party load management for non­intrusive commercial loads.6 Many regulatory
barriers prevent the mass penetration of real­time electric information and load­management
services from penetrating the mass commercial markets. Those barriers can be easily overcome
but require fundamental structural changes to occur. Recommended changes include:
3. Integration of information and load management solutions into the local distribution
company (LDC) bill. Allowing customers to select these services through their local utility
would facilitate streamlined penetration into the mass commercial markets. They could be
included as an optional part of a comprehensive standard­offer generation rate or in some
other fashion. This option is viable because real­time energy­use information and proactive
load management have significant value to the commodity suppliers or marketers and could
reduce customer bills.
4. Ability of demand resources to participate in the wholesale electric markets. The wholesale
electric generation market today is currently a bid­only market in which dispatching of
resources is managed by the independent system operator(s) with no consumer participation.
The current emergency­response programs are the only opportunity for loads to participate in
the wholesale commodity markets. These programs provide only limited opportunity in
instances in which the electricity system is constrained to the point of affecting reliability.
Until a robust day­ahead bidding market is developed, consumer participation will be limited,
resulting in potential price instability and variability. The development of these markets is
critical to the development of a competitive electric industry.
5. Including an EE component in the alternative transitional standard offer. Non­intrusive load
reductions are implemented when the reductions in specific energy use are not intrusive to
occupants; they typically occur without occupant involvement or knowledge that they are
taking place. Typical examples of these types of solutions include lighting dimming at slight

The third­party load management techniques strawman proposal, prepared by NXEGEN, is the primary source of
information on third­party load management techniques recommendations, costs and benefits. Significant portions
of this section are excerpted verbatim from the third­party load management techniques strawman proposal and
the full strawman proposal is available in the RCI Assumptions Document (October 30, 2003).

Non­intrusive loads refer to reductions in specific energy use that are not intrusive to occupants and typically occur
without occupant involvement or knowledge that they are taking place. Typical examples of these types of
solutions include dimming lights during peak hours where ambient light levels are high and planned cycling of
refrigeration compressors.

Emission reductions were calculated by multiplying the market potential for reductions by the
marginal CO2 emission rate for the regional electricity grid (Table 26.1). The potential non­
intrusive commercial load in Connecticut is approximately 4 to 6 percent of the market size, or
100 to 150 MW (NXEGEN, 2003). The relevant market segments include the commercial
(office, retail, warehouse), industrial (process, fabrication), and municipal (city buildings, police,
fire, library, schools) markets.

The current utility emergency­response programs are offering a customer rebate of $500 per KW

27. State Procurement of Environmentally Preferable Services
and Products
Recommended Action:

Consider increasing preferences for products and services that
decrease GHG emissions and/or mitigate climate change impact.

Several policies currently require the State of Connecticut to consider environmentally preferable
products, recycled content, and other “green” goods and services. For example, CGS 4a­67h
requires Connecticut Department of Administrative Services to establish procedures that promote
procurement of environmentally preferable products and services, and an environmental
purchasing advisor position was created to develop the program. State agencies should consider
increasing preferences for products and services that decrease GHG emissions and/or mitigate
the impact of climate change.

The State should consider the NEDRI report as a whole. The New England Independent System
Operator (NE ISO) and various State DPUCs, wires companies, and various states’ DEP worked
together to develop a series of recommendations over an 18­month period. The NEDRI report
provides a good overview and identifies many measures that can be implemented at the federal
and State level. In addition, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) plans to use
NEDRI as a model for other state ISOs. The working group cannot recommend the whole
package of measures because of time limitations and potential conflict of interest by select
stakeholders (e.g., DPUC and DEP cannot prejudge proposals that may come before them).

29. Promote Voluntary Programs and Actions
Recommended Action:

Promote voluntary programs and actions.

The State should strongly promote voluntary programs and actions for the appropriate sectors.
State agencies would need to play a coordinating role and devote some resources to this. Partners
who have joined these programs could also be supportive by playing a mentoring role. Although
some programs already exist at the national level, opportunities to develop additional programs
in Connecticut may exist. The Connecticut State government does not necessarily devote
resources toward promoting participation in existing national programs.
The following voluntary programs could be included in this measure:

30. Encourage Clean Combined Heat and Power
Recommended Action:

Encourage clean combined heat and power.7

The goal of this policy is to push the development of new, clean, combined heat and power
(CHP) electricity generation using existing and available technology, which is extremely clean
and efficient. The policy consists of two elements:
6. Reducing the current barriers to development of CHP projects (e.g., permitting and
interconnection hurdles, standby power rates)
7. Exploring further mechanisms to promote CHP, such as a CHP portfolio standard.
With regard to the second recommendation, the stakeholder group explored one mechanism to
promote CHP in Connecticut: mandating that a small but growing percentage of the portfolio of
power delivered to Connecticut customers come from clean CHP. In effect, this policy could be
considered a third class of power generation within the Connecticut RPS (Class 1 Renewables,
Class 2 Renewables, and Class 3 CHP). Under such a measure, a CHP portfolio standard would
be developed that mandates that a minimum portion of the electric power sold by suppliers in the
State come from clean CHP generation. The power generation should be tracked using the GIS
system, with certificates generated for every MWh of production. The certificates could be
traded among retail providers of electricity to satisfy the portfolio standard. CHP generation
eligible for the portfolio standard would have to meet minimum standards for emissions and
efficiency. The portfolio standard would begin with small percentages of power having to be
generated by CHP sources and would increase with time.
The following is an outline of a proposed CHP portfolio standard.8 The stakeholder group agreed
to further explore the details of this mechanism, including the start­up date (e.g., postponing until
2007), the required emissions rate to qualify as clean CHP, and the percentage targets required
each year.

The clean combined heat and power strawman proposal, prepared by Environment Northeast and United
Technologies, is the primary source of information on the clean combined heat and power recommendations.
Significant portions of this section are excerpted verbatim from the clean combined heat and power strawman
proposal and the full strawman proposal is available in the RCI Assumptions Document (October 30, 2003).

The portfolio standard draws on the current Connecticut RPS policy, the work and recommendations of the
European Union for the promotion of cogeneration (http://europa.eu.int/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l27021.htm), and the
proposed framework for a “European CHP Certificate Trading System” presented by Oko­Institute at the
ECoCerT workshop in February 2003 (
http://www.cogen.org/Downloadables/Presentations/Ecocert/Presentation_Ecocert_Oekoinstitute.pdf).

State Certification and Review (Reducing Barriers to CHP Development)
§
§
§
§

Facilities must be certified by DPUC as eligible. (Facility owners are responsible for
ensuring and documenting compliance with emissions and efficiency requirements.)
The Connecticut Siting Council will expedite review of eligible CHP facilities for
interconnection.
The DEP may expedite review of eligible CHP facilities for permitting.
Connecticut should request that FERC set standby power prices that promote distributed
generation (DG) and CHP construction (economically justified).

Definition of Eligible CHP Facilities
§
§

Facilities must be located in the State of Connecticut.
Minimum average quarterly system efficiency must be greater than or equal to 70
percent.
­
This is a total efficiency measure based on electricity and useful heat, so ultra­high­
efficiency electricity generation that met the 70 percent minimum efficiency would
also qualify.
­
The facility owner must document a heat load and the use of that heat to meet the
efficiency target.
­
The facility owner must track system efficiency (metering) and document that the
heat was used and not dissipated through the use of cooling towers, vents, or exhaust
stacks.

Must Meet or Exceed the Following Emissions Requirements (Under Control)
§
§

§

These emissions numbers may require additional analysis.
The following emissions rates are per megawatt hour for electricity output alone:
­
NOx less than or equal to 0.15 lbs/MWh
­
SO2 less than or equal to 0.05 lbs/MWh
­
PM10 less than or equal to 0.08 lbs/MWh
­
CO2 less than or equal to 1350 lbs/MWh.
Documentation must be completed on a quarterly basis and submitted to DEP and/or
DPUC.

Generation of CHP Certificates
§

Facilities that are certified by DPUC as being eligible will generate one CHP certificate
per MWh of electricity generated.
§ The certificates will be the same as the New England GIS certificates for the facility and
will be traded and tracked using the GIS system.
§ In the same method as renewable certificates, CHP certificates can be generated at the
facility even if power is not sold into the grid, as long as approved metering is used.
CHP Portfolio Standard Requirements

128



§
§

§

§

Every retail supplier of electricity will be required to purchase CHP certificates to satisfy
the CHP percentage mandated by this portfolio standard.
GIS certificates can only count toward one of the portfolio standards. Fuel cells, which
may qualify for both Class 1 renewables and the CHP standard, would only be allowed to
count toward one requirement. No double counting will be permitted.
The schedule and percentage requirements should begin at 0.50 percent in 2005 and
increase at a rate of 0.5 percent per year until they reach 8 percent in 2020; the percentage
is based on the portion of total delivered kilowatt hours.
Failure to meet the portfolio requirements would lead to a payment by the retail supplier
equal to $0.02/kWh to the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund for the development of high
efficiency, clean CHP systems within the State (money earmarked for this use).

Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.532 MMTCO2e (based on 4 percent CHP in 2010) in 2010
1.414 MMTCO2e (based on 8 percent CHP in 2020) in 2020
Indirect emission reductions were calculated by estimating the amount of electricity the new
CHP units generate. It is assumed that the new CHP generation would be offsetting an equivalent
amount of electricity from the grid. The amount of total delivered kilowatt hours from new CHP
units was estimated by subtracting the delivered kWh from CHP plants built under the Reference
Case scenario from the total delivered kWh required by this portfolio standard. To estimate
savings, the resulting kWh was multiplied by the marginal CO2 emission factor for the electricity
grid.
The direct emissions reductions were estimated by subtracting the CO2 emissions generated from
the new CHP plants from the CO2 emissions generated by the business­as­usual (BAU) boilers,
which were assumed to be oil fired (Table 30.1).

31. Restore Conservation and Load Management Fund
Recommended Action:

Restore the Conservation and Load Management Fund.

The State should restore full funding ($87 million) to the Conservation and Load Management
Fund. BAU assumes $50 million in Years 1 and 2 and $60 million in years beyond that. In
addition, the State should consider expanding the fund in light of the findings of a recent Energy
Conservation Management Board (ECMB) study. Funds should be directed and applied to the
intended use for the lifetime of the fund.
The Energy Efficiency and Conservation Potential study (GDS Associates and Quantum
Consulting, 2003) highlights specific cost­effective measures that could be implemented within
the next 10 years to reduce electricity consumption, assuming available funding from the ECMB.
Special attention should be given to EE measures in the Commercial and Industrial (C/I) sectors
(e.g., standard retrofit/lost opportunity and C/I incentives and rebates).
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.279 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.606 MMTCO2e in 2020
Because the fund targets measures that reduce electricity consumption, the emission reductions
are indirect (Table 31.1).

32. Heating Oil Conservation Fund
Recommended Action:

Establish a Heating Oil Conservation Fund.

The State should establish an annual fund, based on a 3 percent surcharge on oil consumption,
that will provide approximately $20 million per year for EE investment programs for equipment
and buildings that use heating oil. Funds should be directed and applied to the intended use for
the lifetime of the fund. The fund’s board will report annually on the cost effectiveness of the
fund’s programs (in terms of $/tCO2 saved).
Current Connecticut “public benefits” EE investment programs are funded through electricity
surcharges and do not fund programs that improve the energy efficiency of heating oil
consumption (due to equity issues between ratepayer classes). This action would establish new
programs that would improve the efficiency of heating oil use in Connecticut.
The program would involve the following measures:
§ Creating a heating oil conservation fund and associated conservation programs. The
fund would be earmarked for improving efficiency of oil use and would focus on
buildings with heating oil service for space and water heating; new construction and
building renovation as well as long­lived equipment (e.g., furnaces) that operates on
heating oil; and market­based programs that would stimulate EE investments in this area.
§ Creating a new oil conservation management board to supervise the program; the board
would report annually on the cost­effectiveness of the funds’ programs ($/tCO2 saved).
§ Ensuring that funds are directed and applied to the intended use for the lifetime of the
fund.
In addition, the board would work with existing electricity conservation programs to implement
fuel­blind programs that address energy efficiency and conservation of all energy sources and
building envelopes (10 to 20 percent of funding). The program would also need to work closely
with related programs, such as those undertaken by the National Oil heat Research Alliance
(NORA), to ensure that work already being done is not duplicated.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
The program is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by
1.02 MMTCO2e in 2010
1.89 MMTCO2e in 2020

133



These estimates are derived from assessing a 3 percent charge on residential, commercial, and
industrial fuel use.9 A percentage charge was used in order to maintain fuel neutrality between
oil and natural gas (see Recommended Action #33).10 Over the life of the project, this creates an
average annual fund of $20 million. Technology costs were estimated using two methods. First,
the Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) database of energy efficiency projects was queried for
fuel oil projects. This provided cost effectiveness ($/gallon reduced) information for the
industrial sector. Administrative costs were added for an aggregate technology cost measure.
Second, technology cost effectiveness for the residential and commercial sectors were set equal
to those used in the natural gas analysis (See 33. Creating a Natural Gas Conservation
Program) on a MMBtu/$ basis. To confirm this method, the IAC costs for the industrial sector
were scaled based on the relative costs of technology for each sector in the natural gas analysis.
The two methods yielded consistent results.
The funds were used each year to invest in technology improvements and pay administrative
costs. The size of the fund decreases every year. This is due to the success of the program: as
consumption decreases, there is less purchased oil, and fewer gallons are assessed the surcharge.
The funded projects are modeled to provide benefits for fifteen years. At the end of fifteen
years, consumers are expected to replace the technology with equipment that has at least the
same energy efficiency. 11 This makes the energy efficiency improvements purchased through
the fund permanent.
The reductions in the first years of the program are relatively large because the fund is used to
fund low­cost projects. In later years, the projects become more expensive. Consumption
continues to decrease, but at a slower rate.
Reasons Behind Differences From Previous Analysis and for Differences Between
Sectors
There are two primary reasons for why the benefits of the new analysis substantially exceed the
old analysis. The largest is due to changing the assumption that the fund will pay the entire cost
of each project. The new assumption is that consumers will need to match the fund on a 1 to 1
basis (on average) in order to obtain help from the fund. Essentially, this leveraging doubles the
benefits of the program. Second, the original analysis was based on a technology cost
effectiveness of $29/Mcf for each sector on the natural gas side. This was converted to MMBtu
and applied to the oil fund as well. Though this was accurate for the residential sector, the cost
effectiveness ratios for the commercial and industrial were much lower ($9.6/Mcf and $6.9/Mcf
respectively). These lower cost effectiveness ratios resulted in more GHG reductions per dollar
available for these two sectors over the previous study.

9

Fuel oil prices were taken from the EIA long term energy forecast (EIA, Energy Outlook 2004, January 2004).
The work group assumed that a uniform rate along with uniform prices on a heat rate basis would be sufficient to
make the policies neutral between oil and gas.
11
The workgroup agreed that this was the most realistic option for several reasons such as voluntary equipment
standards improving over time, the economics of investment in these types of projects, and the fact that some
technologies are old and will no longer be available.
10

134



Several factors explain why benefits for the oil fund are substantially lower than those for natural
gas. First, consumption is more heavily weighted to the residential side which is less cost­
effective. Second, consumption over time in the oil sector is predicted to decrease and
consumption on the natural gas side is predicted to increase. Third, the natural gas prices were
adjusted beyond the conservative estimate provided by the U.S. Energy Information
Administration using reliable market predictors. Similar predictors were unavailable for oil,
meaning that the price was lower and that the revenue from a surcharge were commensurately
lower. Finally, decreasing marginal returns on energy efficiency technology kicked in more
quickly for oil consumption than natural gas. Based on the conservative price and marginal
returns assumptions, the oil analysis is very conservative and benefits will likely be greater.
Estimated Costs
There are two separate costs used in the model. The first is the charge to consumers of 3 percent.
Second, it is assumed that consumers will pay for a portion of the energy efficiency projects.
The model assumes that consumers will pay for 50 percent. This conservative estimate was used
to ensure that the benefits of the program were not overstated. It further allows flexibility, as
some consumers will be able to afford a higher match, while others may not be able to provide
any matching funds (e.g. low­income residential consumers). These costs are then used to pay
for the technology, installation, and administration. Finally, an indirect cost, considered for the
REMI modeling described below (see “Co­Benefits”), was lost revenue to oil suppliers.

the economy­wide costs and benefits of the policy. The following summarizes the REMI results:

Reductions in criteria pollutants were also analyzed, using the U.S. EPA’s COBRA model (beta
version). This model takes air pollution reductions, translates them into improvements in health,
and then monetizes the benefits of the health improvements. The following are the combined
results of the COBRA analysis for both the oil and natural gas funds:

“compensation differential,” which accounts for economic improvements due to quality of life
improvements such as air pollution reductions. The following table shows the impacts of
COBRA with and without the compensation differential:

This is due to a loss in gas tax revenue, which is inevitable in any successful transportation measure.

136



The results of the REMI model show a small negative effect upon the economy. The negative
effect is due to the loss in revenue for the medical and insurance industry. Even though
Connecticut benefits economically from an increase in labor productivity and the compensating
differential, the benefits do not outweigh the loss in revenue for the medical and insurance
industry
Progress – In Process
Further analysis has been done to quantify co­benefits. Significant Positive economy­wide
benefits have been determined. Implementation actions are pending. Legislation will be
necessary.

33. Natural Gas Conservation Fund
Recommended Action:

Establish a Natural Gas Conservation Fund.

The State should establish an annual fund, based on a 3 percent surcharge on oil consumption,
that will provide approximately $30 million for EE investment programs for equipment and
buildings that utilize natural gas. Funds should be directed and applied to the intended use for the
lifetime of the fund. The fund’s board will report annually on the cost effectiveness of the fund’s
programs (in terms of $/tCO2 saved).
Current Connecticut “public benefits” EE investment programs are funded through electricity
surcharges and do not fund programs that improve the energy efficiency of natural gas
consumption (due to equity issues between ratepayer classes). This action would establish new
programs that would improve the efficiency of natural use in Connecticut. Because the programs
would operate in conjunction with electric efficiency programs, joint­fuel and fuel blind
initiatives could increase the ability to treat whole buildings regardless of fuel type.
The program would involve the following measures:
§ Creating a natural gas conservation fund and associated conservation programs. The
fund would be earmarked for improving efficiency of natural gas use and would focus on
buildings with natural gas service for space and water heating; new construction and
building renovation as well as long­lived equipment (e.g., furnaces) that operates on
natural gas; and market­based programs that would stimulate EE investments in this area.
§ Creating a new natural gas conservation management board to supervise the program;
the board would report annually on the cost­effectiveness of the fund’s programs ($/tCO2
saved).
§ Addressing natural gas leaks at large industrial and commercial sites.
In addition, the board would work with existing electricity conservation programs to implement
fuel­blind programs that address energy efficiency and conservation of all energy sources and
building envelopes (10 to 20 percent of funding). The program would be funded at a level of $30
million annually. Funds would be directed and applied to the intended use for the lifetime of the
fund.

These estimates are derived from assessing a 3 percent surcharge on residential, commercial, and
industrial natural gas use.13 A percentage charge was used in order to maintain fuel neutrality
between oil and natural gas (see Recommended Action #32).14 Over the life of the project, this
creates an average annual fund of $29 million. Using technology and program cost estimates
developed by the American Council for Energy Efficient Economy (ACEEE),15 the fund
invested in technology improvements and paid for administrative costs. The size of the fund
decreases every year. This is due to the success of the program: as consumption decreases, there
is less purchased oil, and fewer gallons are assessed the 3 percent surcharge.
The funded projects are modeled to provide benefits for fifteen years. At the end of fifteen
years, consumers are expected to replace the technology with equipment that has at least the
same energy efficiency. 16 This makes the energy efficiency improvements purchased through
the fund permanent.
The reductions in the first years of the program are relatively large because the fund is used to
fund low­cost projects. In later years, the projects become more expensive. Consumption
continues to decrease, but at a slower rate.
Reasons Behind Differences From Previous Analysis
There are several reasons for why the benefits of the new analysis substantially exceed the old
analysis. The largest is due to changing the assumption that the fund will pay the entire cost of
each project. The new assumption is that consumers will need to match the fund on a 1 to 1
basis (on average) in order to obtain help from the fund. Essentially, this leveraging doubles the
benefits of the program. Second, the assumption of a 3 percent surcharge raised, on average, $30
million annually instead of $20 million. Third, the original analysis was based on a technology
cost effectiveness of $29/Mcf for each sector. Though this was accurate for the residential
sector, the cost effectiveness ratios for the commercial and industrial were much lower ($9.6/Mcf
and $6.9/Mcf respectively). These lower cost effectiveness ratios resulted in more GHG
reductions per dollar available. Finally, the average price of natural gas across sectors over the
period of analysis was $9.50 instead of the original $8.50.17

Estimated Costs
13

Natural gas prices were used by taking the prices developed by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)
for the electricity sector. These were used because they were deemed more accurate than the currently available
EIA long term forecast. They are based on a combination of the Henry Hub and EIA price forecasts for delivered
natural gas to New England. The EIA long term forecast (EIA, Energy Outlook 2004, January 2004) was used to
adjust the price for each sector. Final delivered costs in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors are
significantly higher than the costs to electricity generators.
14
The work group assumed that a uniform rate along with uniform prices on a heat rate basis would be sufficient to
make the policies neutral between oil and gas.
15
ACEEE, Natural Gas Price Effects of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Practices and Policies
(December 2003).
16
The workgroup agreed that this was the most realistic option for several reasons such as voluntary equipment
standards improving over time, the economics of investment in these types of projects, and the fact that some
technologies are old and will no longer be available.
17
This is based on the delivered cost to the end sectors, which includes the Henry Hub price and then adjustments
for delivery to the sectors in Connecticut. See note 1.

139



There are two separate costs used in the model. The first is the charge to consumers of 3 percent.
Second, it is assumed that consumers will pay for a portion of the energy efficiency project. The

any matching funds (e.g. low­income residential consumers). These costs are then used to pay
for the technology, installation, and administration. Another cost, considered for the REMI
modeling described below (see “Co­Benefits”), was lost revenue to natural gas suppliers.
Natural gas utilities are assumed to be compensated for any loss of revenue dedicated to capital
cost recovery.

34. Identify Measures to Reduce High Global Warming Potential Gases
Recommended Action:

Identify measures to reduce high-global-warming potential gases.

The State should further explore measures to reduce high­global­warming potential (GWP)
gases. High­GWP gas emissions are a growing share of emissions from the RCI sector, rising
from 8 percent in 2010 to 17 percent in 2020. The largest area for growth is projected to be from
ozone­depleting substance (ODS) substitutes. One potentially significant opportunity for
reducing high­GWP gas emission is to implement a leak­reduction and ­maintenance program at
supermarkets. Refrigeration in piping is considerable, and leak rates are estimated to be between
15 and 30 percent. This opportunity should be explored further. In addition, the State should
identify other programs and opportunities to reduce emissions associated with ODS substitute
use.

35. Install Centralized Manure Digesters
Recommended Action: Support the installation of centralized manure digesters.
This program would support the installation of one centralized manure digester by 2010, two by
2015, and three by 2020. Installing anaerobic digesters to process agriculture manure into energy
(e.g., heat, hot water, or electricity) reduces GHG emissions from manure storage and can offset
GHG emissions from energy use. It also produces digested manure, which can contain valuable
nitrogen for crop production.
The group deliberated on a number of implementation approaches for the manure digester
option; however, no specific actions were suggested. The electricity working group highlighted a
number of options for renewable energy that may assist in implementing this option. The
working group discussed options that included funding support from the State and federal
government and private developers, technical assistance, supporting removal of transmission
barriers, and increasing outreach to farmers and communities about the benefits and costs of
manure digesters.

Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.017 MMTCO2e by 2010 1
0.052 MMTCO2e by 2020 2
The installation of each centralized manure digester is assumed to use manure from 3,870 cows
for a total of 3,870 cows in 2010 and 11,610 in 2020. Table 35.1 outlines the key assumptions for
direct and indirect emissions reductions used in the analysis of the manure digester program.3

manure transport, see the supporting documents.

Estimated Costs
The estimated costs of this program are $111.56 to $125.78 per MTCO2e, depending on the type
of turbine installed.4 This analysis was based on the net present value of the estimated GHG
benefits of the total energy savings (both direct and indirect) and the net present value of the
estimated costs. Table 35.2 outlines the key cost assumptions for the analysis.

Estimated Co-Benefits
Implementation of this option could provide ancillary benefits not quantified during the process.
Manure digesters provide benefits related to odor control; water quality; potential improvement
of farm economics (by supporting generation of additional income); and continuation of farming
in the State, which can support both smart growth initiatives and the “increase purchase of
locally grown food” option mentioned later in this section. Digesters also provide benefits for
manure management by avoiding the potential leakage of excess manure into water bodies (e.g.,
Long Island Sound).

36. Reduce Use of Non-Farm Fertilizer
Recommended Action: Reduce non-farm fertilizer use.
This program would seek to reduce the amount of non­farm fertilizer use (e.g., residential and
commercial) from today’s levels by 7.5 percent in 2010 and 15 percent in 2020. A portion of
nitrogen applied to the soil is subsequently emitted as N2O (which has a global warming
potential that is 310 times that of carbon dioxide); therefore, a reduction in the quantity of
fertilizer applied can reduce N2O emissions. This measure would, in part, expand on existing
programs to reduce residential and commercial fertilizer use in Connecticut and would include
the following elements:
§

§

Organic Land Care Program. This program of the Connecticut chapter of the Northeast
Organic Farming Association (NOFA) promotes reducing the use of chemical fertilizers
and fosters ecological stewardship in designing and maintaining landscapes. The program
includes the Standards for Organic Land Care, an education and accreditation program
for organic land­care professionals, and information and events for citizens.5
Freedom Lawn Initiative. This initiative is a voluntary program to decrease the use of
pesticides and chemical fertilizers on residential lawns. The Board of Alderman in
Milford, Connecticut, passed a resolution in 2002 requesting citizen participation in the
program. A local environmental coalition has distributed informational brochures and
lawn signs and sponsors a Freedom Lawn competition. At least one street in Milford
boasts 100 percent participation in the program.

In addition, a requirement to report non­farm fertilizer use was considered. Such a measure
would help provide better information to track progress toward reducing non­farm fertilizer use
and measure the success of the program. Although the working group initially considered
reduction of farm fertilizer use, it was not a priority for analysis as agreed by the stakeholders.
The non­farm fertilizer reduction program would be implemented within Connecticut but could
benefit from regional efforts to reduce non­farm fertilizer consumption.

The amount of fertilizer reduced through this program was based on an estimate of non­farm
fertilizer consumption in Connecticut of 25 million kg.6 Because no estimates were available for
projections of non­farm fertilizer use, the group chose to use existing consumption data. If non­
farm fertilizer use is projected to decline in the State, the benefits of this program may occur in
the reference case instead.7 These values were converted to nitrogen in order to calculate the
GHG emissions; the assumption was that the fertilizer was 15 percent nitrogen. Values were
converted to GHG emissions using the standard assumptions of direct and indirect emissions that
NESCAUM used in calculating the GHG inventory. The GHG emissions reductions do not
include reductions that could occur from other results of the program, such as decreased truck
traffic, passenger vehicles, and fertilizer production.
Estimated Costs
Costs have not been estimated.
Estimated Co-Benefits
The co­benefits of this recommendation have not been quantified at this time. Ancillary benefits
of this program include reducing the nutrient runoff into Long Island Sound and other water
bodies, increasing the organic content of soil (thus increasing carbon sequestration), reducing
GHG emissions (because lawn mowing usually decreases with natural lawn­care methods), and
reducing water consumption (because lawn watering usually decreases with natural lawn care
methods), and increasing biodiversity.
Progress – In Process
The Organic Landcare Program continues to run outreach, training, and accreditation programs
for organic landcare professionals. There are currently 56 accredited organic land care
professionals in Connecticut. There was one accreditation course in Connecticut in 2004;
another will take place in February 2005. In addition, there have been numerous presentations,
articles, and displays on the organic landcare standards to groups such as the CT Chapter of the
Association of Landscape Architects, organic farming groups, garden clubs, environmental
organizations, and faith based communities.
In addition to Milford’s Freedom Lawn Program, the town of Cheshire has announced a
“Freedom Lawn” policy for town­owned land.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation
§ Identify funding and grant opportunities to support and expand programs to reduce
residential and commercial fertilizer use in Connecticut.
§ Provide more outreach to lawn maintenance companies, homeowners, and municipalities
on reduced fertilizer methods and corresponding benefits and co­benefits.
§ Quantify co­benefits (e.g., improved water quality, soil quality, public health) from
reduced chemical fertilizer use.

A number of factors may affect the reference case, including the impact of existing programs to reduce non­farm
fertilizer consumption, landscape size (e.g., size of lawns), landscape type (e.g., some plantings require lower
fertilizer consumption to retain health, and land use (e.g., retaining natural tree cover instead of plantings could
require lower fertilizer use).

37. Buy Locally Grown Food8
Recommended Action: Increase the purchase of locally grown food.
This program would seek to increase the amount of food consumed by Connecticut residents
from locally grown sources by 10 percent in 2010 and 2020. Food processing, packaging,
transportation, and marketing consume 75 to 85 percent of the energy used in the commercial
food industry. Food miles—an estimate of the distance food travels from where it is grown to
where it is purchased—for conventional produce can equal more than 20 times the distance of
locally grown produce.9 In place of commercial produce markets, Connecticut boasts 65 farmers’
markets. The program would be implemented through the following actions:
§

§
§
§

§

§

Enhance the Connecticut­Grown Program to increase consumer awareness of
Connecticut agriculture and promote the regular purchase of Connecticut agricultural
products.
Create an agricultural identity for Connecticut so that residents prefer purchasing a
certain type of Connecticut agricultural product (e.g., Connecticut Blooms)
Increase the development of farmers’ markets and ensure that participating farmers sell
Connecticut­grown products exclusively.
Encourage and promote the purchase, marketing, and sale of State­grown produce by
State institutions and agencies. Potential institutional purchasers include prisons,
hospitals, schools, and colleges (e.g., the Connecticut Department of Administrative
Services has an agreement with its prime vendor to reserve 25 percent of its contract for
local providers).
Support Senior and WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Programs that enable low­income
seniors and mothers to receive coupons redeemable for State­grown produce at State farm
stands and farmers’ markets.
Support programs and efforts to facilitate increased access to farmers’ markets by low­
income households (e.g., funding for wireless EBT machines in farmers’ markets for
food stamp recipients).

implementation approaches for this action. Significant portions of this section are excerpted verbatim from this
letter.

§

Facilitate efforts by farmers to develop value­added agricultural products through a
through a business development or grant program or general marketing assistance from
the Department of Agriculture or other supporting agency. 10

This program would be implemented within Connecticut, but several components could benefit
from regional efforts. Although the actions recommended above would be undertaken within the
State, the GHG emissions reductions would occur both within the State and outside because the
transport of food crosses several geographic boundaries.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Achieving this level of recycling and source reduction is estimated to reduce GHG emissions by
0.003 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.003 MMTCO2e in 2020
The estimates of GHG emissions reductions were based on a study conducted in Iowa that
considered the impact of increasing the consumption of locally produced food by 10 percent.11
The study considered the GHG emissions of transporting food from the conventional system
(e.g., national retail and wholesale markets) and a local system (e.g., farmers who market and
sell directly to food buyers). Information was not available on the quantity of food currently
consumed from local Connecticut sources. The results include the GHG emissions reductions
occurring through the entire transportation chain; however, they do not include other potential
reductions. For example, a study by the Rodale Institute found that using organic farming
practices increased soil carbon content by 15 to 28 percent.12
A recent survey found that Connecticut residents believe that locally grown foods are healthy (76
percent) and fresher (88 percent) than non­locally grown or produced foods.13 Local markets for
local agricultural products deliver items to consumers in a cost­effective, resource­efficient way.
Estimated Costs
Costs have not been estimated.

Estimated Co-Benefits
This program can provide a number of ancillary benefits not fully addressed as part of this
process, including reduction of air emissions from reduced food transport; support for economic
development for Connecticut farms; and pesticide and water pollution, depending on the type of
farming practice supported. Other ancillary benefits include helping to preserve farmland from
energy­intensive development; ensuring the continued economic viability of the small family
farm; supporting clean, environmentally sensitive farming practices; helping maintain
biodiversity in food plants; and contributing to regional prosperity. The quantification of co­
benefits associated with this recommendation has net yet been determined.
Progress – In Process
The CT Grown program of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture continues to increase the
purchase of locally grown foods in the state. Currently there are 19 schools and 25 farmers
participating in the Farm to Schools program and buying local produce for school cafeterias.
This program has increased significantly in the past two years when 3 schools and 3 farmers
participated. In 2004, there are 70 farmers’ markets in the state selling locally grown produce. In
addition, a number of large institutions are currently purchasing or considering purchasing
locally grown produce, including the Department of Corrections and the University of
Connecticut. At the end of 2004, the Department of Agriculture was able to hire another
employee to work on the CT Grown program, using funds from the USDA.
The CT General Assembly passed legislation in 2004 to require DAS to give preference to CT
grown in contracts for diary, poultry, eggs, fruits, and vegetables (An Act Concerning
Preservation of the Family Farm and Long Island Sound, PA 04­222) and to require DOA to
establish a “Connecticut Farm Fresh” promotional program.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation
§ Support Department of Agriculture’s CT Grown program.
§

Coordinate with Department of Agriculture to promote a greater understanding of GHG
reduction benefits from purchase of locally grown foods.

§

Continue outreach to institutions and state agencies on purchase of locally grown food.

§

Coordinate with Department of Agriculture to monitor progress towards goal and to
quantify, where possible, GHG reductions and co­benefits from increased purchase of
locally grown food.

38. Research on Connecticut Forest Management and Carbon Offsets14
Recommended Action:

Foster a research program on Connecticut forest management and
carbon offsets.

A research program is needed to examine Connecticut’s public and private forests and determine
how they could be best managed to maximize carbon sequestration and to develop markets for
offsets from terrestrial carbon sinks. Land­based carbon sequestration typically involves
conserving threatened forest; planting trees and restoring badly degraded agricultural or mineral
extraction lands, where without intervention, forests would take decades to establish themselves;
improving management of productive forestland; and promoting reduced­impact agriculture.
Considering its population density, Connecticut is already heavily forested, and due to various
factors, most agricultural land quickly reverts to forest when abandoned. Thus, few opportunities
exist to prudently expend significant resources on restoration or planting initiatives in this State.
The State should encourage a research program involving a cooperative team from universities,
industry, and the non­governmental organization community; the goal would be to conduct
research on Connecticut’s forest ecosystems and identify the management systems and standards
for carbon “sink” offset projects that would maximize sequestration of carbon. Such a program
would likely be a multiyear project that could seek funding from a wide range of sources. State
funding should be considered, but additional research funds could be secured through foundation
support or federal research funds.
It appears that most of the research on measuring carbon stocks and increasing carbon storage in
forests has focused on merchantable trees, in large part because forest management research has,
since its inception, focused on growing timber and the results of that research are easily
convertible to analyzing management for carbon sequestration in merchantable forest products.
A much wider range of investigation is possible and necessary in order to answer the many
questions that have arisen as a result of concerns with atmospheric CO2 levels. For example, to
maximize carbon absorption and storage, what management methods should be used in forests
that will be preserved?
The research project on carbon offsets would also be directly related to potential forest­based
carbon offset projects and how to quantify the reductions (see the section on cap­and­trade). The
market­based programs would rely on the science and consensus developed through this project
(see supporting document six).

39. Urban Tree Planting Program
Recommended Action: Create an urban tree-planting program.
The State should provide funding and other support to plant 15,000 more sufficiently sized urban
trees than is currently planted by 2010 and an additional 20,000 by 2020. Properly planted trees
in urban areas can decrease energy use by reducing wind speed in winter and by shading
buildings and lowering air temperatures in summer. Improperly planted trees in urban
environments can actually increase energy use by shading buildings in winter and adding
humidity in summer. Tree effects on wind in summer may or may not be beneficial, depending
on air temperature.
To implement this program, Connecticut will need to ensure additional funding for the direct
costs of the trees, maintenance, and technical assistance. Limited funding is currently available
from the U.S. Forest Service. Connecticut will also need to provide technical assistance to ensure
that trees are properly planted (ensuring survival and the largest emissions­reduction potential).
The key factors that affect the ability of a tree to provide direct shading of a building include
placement relative to buildings and seasonal solar angle; type; species foliage characteristics;
height; and crown form, spread, and density. 15
This program would be implemented within Connecticut, but the GHG emissions reductions
would occur both within the State and outside because the resulting reductions in electricity
consumption would have an impact on regional electricity emissions.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.0009 MMTCO2e in 2010 16
0.0019 MMTCO2e in 2020 17
It is estimated that this program would lead to the following energy demand reductions:
§

§

Electricity savings of 1.7 and 3.72 GWh in 2010 and 2020, respectively
Home heating oil savings of 1,092 and 2,340 MMBtu in 2010 and 2020, respectively
Natural gas savings of 693 and 1,485 MMBtu in 2010 and 2020, respectively.

Electricity reductions were converted to GHG emissions using the marginal emissions rate of
electricity from the demand­reduction scenario conducted by the electricity working group since
the electricity demand reductions from this program were included in that scenario. Home
heating oil and natural gas reductions were converted to GHG emissions using emissions factors
developed by the RCI working group.
Estimated Costs
The estimated costs of this program are $9,815 per MTCO2e. This analysis was based on the net
present value of the estimated GHG benefits of the total energy savings (both direct and indirect)
and the net present value of the estimated costs.22
Estimated Co-Benefits
This program would also lead to reductions in other air emissions. A recent study suggested that
a similar tree­planting system could lead to reductions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrous oxide
(N2O), ozone (O3), particulate matter of 10 microns or less (PM10), and SO2.23 In addition,
18

Studies have shown that a well­placed 25 ft tall tree can produce energy savings from cooling of 100–400 kWh/yr
(McPherson & Rowantree, 1993). Value assumed for the analysis in Connecticut assumed electricity savings for
both cooling and heating of 200 kWh/yr.
19
Studies have shown that energy savings from a single tree range from 0.15 to 5.5 MMbtu (Heisler, 1990).
20
The assumptions for this distribution are identical to the assumptions utilized by the RCI working group.
21
Data are based on the percentage of homes in New York that have air conditioning—18% central and 44% room
(U.S. Energy Information Administration, Residential Energy Consumption Survey 1997. Available at:

The study looked at a program to increase new canopy cover of more than 125,000 acres in the New York

planting programs in urban areas should have few barriers to implementation because many
communities are actively pursuing tree­planting programs for reasons other than climate change,
such as aesthetics. The group raised some concerns over whether this level of tree planting could
be achieved, given that many communities are already making significant efforts to replace their
existing forest stock, let alone increase the stock, as envisioned by this program.24
Progress – In Process
The DEP Forestry Division has had an urban forestry grant program for CT towns for about 12
years. The funding, approximately $50 – 60K/year, comes from the USDA Forest Service. DEP
grants are given to towns and non­profit organizations. In 2004, a total of $76,860 was awarded
to CT towns for urban forestry programs. Of this, $28,260 was specifically for urban tree
planting in the towns of East Haddam, Bristol, and Norwalk.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation
§ Continue DEP urban forestry grant program and explore options for additional funding as
necessary to meet goal.
§

As feasible, quantify energy and other air quality co­benefits of urban tree planting.

§

Develop means to monitor progress towards goal and to quantify GHG reductions and
co­benefits from urban tree planting.

40. Forest and Agricultural Land Preservation25
Recommended Action: Preserve existing forest and agricultural land.
This program would seek to avoid releases of carbon due to conversion of forest and agricultural
land to development. When forest and agricultural land is converted carbon is emitted when trees
are cut and when the ability of agricultural soil to sequester carbon from the atmosphere is
diminished, since forest and agricultural land sequester carbon in plant matter (e.g., trees) and
soils. Therefore, avoiding the conversion of this land to development, in conjunction with smart
growth measures, preserves the carbon­absorption capacity of existing forest and agricultural
lands and enables continued carbon sequestration from the atmosphere. According to one federal
study, on average, 8,200 acres per year—4,700 acres of forest and 3,500 acres of agricultural
land—are converted to development in Connecticut. This program would be implemented
through the following measures (more details are available in Supporting Document 4):
§

§

§
§

Open­space conservation and stewardship programs to ensure that future releases of
carbon occurring through conversion of forest and grasslands to development are reduced
below current levels and are balanced by land­acquisition and ­management initiatives
Acceleration of farmland preservation by expanding the Farmland Preservation Program,
including exploring alternative means of funding the program, taking advantage of
available federal and other matching funding, and considering additional criteria for
selecting land through the program
Measures to reduce the consumption of land by sprawling development, such as those
outlined in the smart growth recommendation
Possibly other measures, such as impact fees, which would be used to preserve open
space on farmlands.

The State of Connecticut has set the following goal for open space: to have at least 10% of
Connecticut’s land area held by the state as open space for the beneficial use and enjoyment of
the public as additions to the State’s system of parks, forests, wildlife, fisheries and natural
resource management areas; and to have a total of 21% of Connecticut’s land (673,210 acres)
preserved as open space by the year 2023 in state, municipal, private nonprofit, water utility and
federal ownership.26 In addition, Section 23­74 of the Connecticut General Statutes lists carbon
sequestration as one of the purposes of the state’s recreation and natural heritage trust program:

to acquire land to “offset carbon dioxide produced through combustion of fossil fuels by
preserving lands that naturally absorb it.”
In addition to the 21% open space goal, the Connecticut Department of Agriculture has a goal of
preserving 130,000 acres, including 85,000 acres of cropland. This goal will enable Connecticut
farms to produce at least 50 percent of milk needs and 70 percent of in­season fresh fruits and
vegetables, output that has implications for the support of local farm products mentioned earlier
in this section.27
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.283 MMTCO2e in 2010 28
0.283 MMTCO2e in 2020 29
Wide ranges of estimates exist for the carbon currently sequestered in forests. Essentially, the
estimates range from 20 to 100 metric tons per acre per year for Connecticut forests. For this
analysis, it was assumed that Connecticut forests sequester an average of 60 metric tons per acre.
The amount of natural land targeted for preservation is based on the analysis of the Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the USDA, which found that from 1982 to 1997, an
average of 4,700 acres of forestland was converted to development each year in Connecticut.30
The quantity of carbon sequestered by agricultural land will depend on the time the land has been
under tillage. Estimates range from 0.367 to 0.734 MTCO2e per acre per year. A conservative
estimate of 0.367 MTCO2e per acre per year was used. The amount of farmland lost was
assumed to be 3,500 acres per year, similar to the rate from the NRCS analysis between 1982
and 1987.
With any of the approaches for implementation mentioned above, it is difficult to assess precise
carbon emission offsets due to the "leakage" factor—the fact that at least some indeterminable
amount of avoided development and resulting emissions will simply be displaced to other
communities or states. The leakage factor would make it difficult to impose restrictions or fees
on specific development proposals that could be tied to precise carbon impacts. Therefore,
statewide open space, agricultural land preservation, and smart growth measures were considered
as the most appropriate mechanisms.
Estimated Costs
These emissions reductions are estimated to cost $137 per MTCO2e.31 The forestland
preservation program is estimated to cost $6,000 per acre across the State, the average amount
the DEP has paid for land in the past four years. At that rate, the acquisition of 4,700 acres of
forestland would cost a total of $28.2 million per year. For the four and a half years from mid­

1998 through 2002, the State of Connecticut bonded approximately $210 million through four
open­space programs and initiatives, acquiring outright ownership or conservation restrictions
over or assisting towns and nonprofit groups in acquiring approximately 44,000 acres. Annually,
the State averaged expenditures of $46.6 million and preserved or helped to preserve an average
of 9,777 acres. A significant portion of the land preserved through State funds was done under a
matching grant program in which the DEP provided towns and private conservation groups with
matching grants, usually 50 percent of the land cost. If such a program were to comprise half of
the DEP’s efforts, the 4,700 acres could be acquired at a cost of approximately $21.4 million per
year.
The cost of the farmland preservation program was based on the historical cost of the
Connecticut Farmland Preservation program—$3,000 per acre to purchase the development
rights. At that rate, the preservation of 3,500 acres is estimated to cost $10.5 million per year.
Estimated Co-Benefits
A program aimed at preserving open space (both forest and agricultural land) provides ancillary
benefits, which can further diminish the ratio cost per ton of this approach. These benefits have
not been specifically quantified as part of this process, but they were a subject of deliberations
during the working group and stakeholder meetings. Benefits of the forestland­preservation
program include promoting wildlife habitat, protecting and improving water quality, improving
the “livability” of the State, and supporting smart growth initiatives in the State. The agricultural
land­preservation program can provide ancillary benefits, including support for economic
development (especially in rural parts of the State) by maintaining agricultural capacity, enabling
the continued consumption of locally grown agricultural products (which can further enhance
and enable Recommended Action #37 Buy Locally Grown Food), and supporting smart growth
initiatives in the State.
Progress – In Process
To date, 23% of the Connecticut Department of Agriculture’s 130,000­acre preservation goal has
been met through the purchase of development rights program. In 2004, $2.2 million was
allocated by State Bond Commission to purchase development rights on 1,133 acres of prime
farmland. This is significant progress over 2003, in which no farmland was preserved. As of
December 2004, 29,980 acres total on 211 Connecticut farms have been preserved through the
program.
In addition, approximately 1,000 acres were preserved as open space in DEP land holdings
during 2004.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation
§ Work with land conservation organizations to promote carbon sequestration as a
criteria/benefit in addition to traditional land preservation goals.
§

Determine total number of acres of open space in CT and identify means to monitor
progress toward meeting goals and quantify GHG reductions from land preservation.

§

Coordinate land preservation efforts with smart growth initiatives.

41. Promote Use of Durable Wood Products32
Promote use of durable wood products.
This program would promote the use of durable wood products over other construction materials
through a voluntary education campaign on climate change and what consumers can do to
minimize their impacts. This program should encourage individual and business consumers to
consider certified­sustainable wood products when buying furniture, building homes, and
working on other structures. In addition, the State in its procurement process should lead by
example and maximize its purchase of wood products. To ensure that increased use of timber
results in a benefit to the environment, wood products should be produced and manufactured as a
result of certified­sustainable harvesting practices.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
The GHG benefits and costs of this program were not analyzed because data on the potential
increase in durable wood use was unavailable.33
The substitution of durable wood products for other materials is beneficial both because of the
carbon that wood building materials sequester and because of the energy use they avoid. For
example, production of steel, aluminum, plastic, brick, and concrete has high energy
requirements compared with wood. The “embodied energy,” or the amount of energy used to
produce a given material, varies from product to product. Following are estimates of embodied
energy for typical building materials:
§
§
§
§
§

Simple sawed wood product: 3 GJ Mg­1
Plywood: 14 GJ Mg­1
Steel: 20–25 GJ Mg­1
Plastic: 60–80 GJ Mg­1
Aluminum: 190 GJ Mg­1

Most energy used in the manufacture of these materials comes from sources that emit significant
GHGs. Unless materials are currently produced using energy from clean renewable or non­fossil
sources, products with lower embodied energy are responsible for lower GHG emissions.
32

The carbon sequestration straw proposal, prepared by Environment Northeast and The Nature Conservancy, is the
primary source of information on this recommendation. Significant portions of this section are excerpted verbatim
from the carbon sequestration straw proposal.
33
For durable wood products, the benefits would depend on the extent to which the program achieved purchase of
durable wood products over other construction materials.

162



Estimated Costs
Costs were not estimated.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Durable wood products, which are used for furniture or construction and have been in use for
decades or more, sequester carbon as they sit in a home or office building. Increased use of
locally grown and manufactured durable wood products could also be a benefit to the
Connecticut timber industry and thereby help prevent the conversion of forestland into
commercial or residential use.

42. Support Economically Viable Landfill Gas to Energy Projects
Recommended Action: Encourage landfill gas-to-energy (LFGE) projects.
This program would seek to increase the number of landfills in Connecticut that reduce methane
and generate electricity through the following actions:
§

§

§

Encourage the generation of an additional 18.5 MW of electricity from landfill gas­to­
energy (LFGE) projects in the State through the Connecticut renewable portfolio
standard.
Support interconnection of these projects by working with the DPUC to ensure that
LFGE projects are allowed to connect to the grid (even projects under 1 MW). In
addition, work with DPUC and DEP to provide streamlined permitting for these projects.
Join the EPA Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) State Partnership Program,
which provides assistance with developing regulations and funding opportunities, among
other things.

Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
In the analysis of the electricity sector reference case, an additional 18.5 MW of landfill gas
generation was installed. Therefore, the GHG benefits of this program were included in the
electricity­ and waste­sector baselines. 34 Although the GHG benefits of this action should not be
considered as reductions from the reference case (they are estimated to occur in the electricity
sector reference case without additional steps), it is important to note the GHG reductions from
this program.
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.447 MMTCO2e in 2010 35
0.452 MMTCO2e in 2020 36
The State provided EPA’s LMOP staff with revised data on existing landfills in Connecticut. The
LMOP staff reviewed the landfill data and provided a preliminary estimate that 18.5 MW of
LFGE potential exists in the State.37 The electricity working group chose to include all 18.5 MW
34

The GHG impact from the conversion of methane to energy is included in the electricity sector reference case (see
the detailed discussion of electricity sector baseline). The GHG impact of methane conversion was calculated
outside the electricity sector analysis and accounted for in the waste sector baseline.

as potential new LFGE in the IPM modeling (see the electricity sector recommendations for
more details). In 2006, IPM estimated that in the electricity reference case, an additional 18.5
MW of electricity generation from LFGE projects would be installed in Connecticut and that
additional LFGE generation would take place in surrounding regions (see electricity sector
analysis). The GHG benefits from the conversion of methane were calculated outside the
electricity sector analysis using standard assumptions of LMOP staff. Because some of the
landfills envisioned currently flare their methane, the landfills currently with flaring were
subtracted from the additional benefit of this program to avoid double counting (see Table 42.1).

43. Increase Recycling and Source Reduction38
Recommended Action: Increase recycling and source reduction to 40 percent.
This program would seek to increase source reduction and recycling of municipal solid waste
(MSW) to 40 percent by 2010 and to maintain at least 40 percent source reduction and recycling
through 2020.39 Some potential implementation strategies include: increasing education and
enforcement of recycling requirements; adopting “Pay as You Throw” (PAYT) programs for
residential waste; increasing composting of source­separated organics (from commercial,
industrial, and institutional generators and residential sources); increasing small­business
recycling; supporting recycling markets; increasing electronics recycling; increasing “producer
responsibility” requirements for products.
This program would be implemented within Connecticut, but several components could benefit
from regional efforts. Although the actions recommended above would be undertaken within the
State, the GHG emissions reductions would occur both within the State and outside because
recycling and source reduction lower emissions from “mine­to­mouth.”
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.91 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.97 MMTCO2e in 2020
Using the waste­generation baseline described earlier in this report, it is estimated that this
approach would require recycling or source reduction of an additional 416,000 tons of MSW in
2010 and 443,000 tons in 2020. This waste avoidance was included in EPA’s Waste Reduction
Model (WARM) using an assumption of mixed recyclables.40 The WARM model uses life­cycle
emission factors to calculate the GHG savings, so a share of those emissions reductions will
occur outside the State.

38

The recycling and source reduction straw proposal, prepared by the Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection, is the primary source of information on this recommendation. Discussions of resource recovery
facilities were drawn from draft write­ups prepared by the Connecticut Resource Recovery Facilities Authority.
Significant portions of this section are excerpted verbatim from those write­ups.
39
The Connecticut DEP estimates that the State is currently recycling 23.3 percent of its waste and source reducing
1.3 percent. Analysis conducted by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority estimates that the level of
recycling and source reduction is significantly higher, 42 percent. Regardless of the absolute percentages, the
group agreed that doubling the current level of recycling and source reduction is the important goal.
40
The WARM model and details on the key assumptions are available at
www.epa.gov/globalwarming/actions/waste/usersguide.htm

166



Estimated Costs
The estimated costs of this program are $4 to $5 per MTCO2e. The cost estimates were based
upon values by DEP staff indicating that implementing this program could cost $4.1 million per
year (see the chapter appendix for detailed estimates).41 The working group and stakeholders
were not able to consider whether this level of funding was sufficient to meet the level or
recycling and source­reduction envisioned given time and resource limitations.
Estimated Co-Benefits
The potential ancillary impact of this program includes the following benefits:
§ Ancillary benefits of recycling include decreases in raw materials acquisition (through
fossil fuel energy and other emissions and changes in forest carbon sequestration),
manufacturing (fossil fuel energy emissions), and transportation­related emissions.
§ Source­reduction and recycling programs avoid the need for new disposal facilities and
thus avoids land­use and siting issues; waste transportation issues; other pollutants from
waste combustion; and generation of ash residue, which requires handling, transportation,
and disposal.
§ Electronic recycling and producer responsibility provide co­benefits through reduced
toxicity of the waste stream.
Progress – Action Pending
The Department of Environmental Protection has issued a Request for Proposals for the
development of a statewide solid waste management plan. This plan, which should be completed
by early 2006, will further identify and analyze measures to increase recycling and source
reduction to 40%.
Suggested Next Steps for Implementation
§ DEP select contractor to help with development of statewide solid waste management
plan. Ensure that solid waste management plan: addresses climate change impacts
associated with various waste management methods; provides detailed implementation
strategies to attain 40% source reduction/recycling by 2010 or suggests appropriate
revision to goal; and identifies dedicated funding sources and timeline to implement
source reduction/recycling measures.

44. Voluntary Carbon Offset Program
Recommended Action: Encourage voluntary carbon offset programs from agriculture,
forestry, and waste reductions.
The State should encourage voluntary programs on carbon offsets (i.e., efforts to reduce GHG
emissions by sources not covered by specific recommendations from the stakeholders and
outside the State or the country).

Tropics, Inc. is a non­profit organization committed to the development and demonstration of
projects that offset US­generated carbon dioxide emissions by planting new tropical forests.
Reforest The Tropics has linked a number of CT carbon dioxide emitters with reforestation
projects in Costa Rica. Connecticut’s voluntary participants include the Mohegan Tribal Nation,
Connecticut College, the CT Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative, schools and individuals.

45. Renewable Energy Strategy (RES)
Recommended Action: Implement the renewable energy strategy (RES).
Promote the development of renewable energy in Connecticut and in the region as a long­term
GHG emissions­reduction strategy and encourage the renewable industry in Connecticut. The
RES consists of a number of policy components: adoption of an enhanced RPS in the State,
purchases of renewable energy by State government, and a PTC. The IPM model was used to
quantify the RES.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)

0.0 MMTCO2e in 2010
1.33 MMTCO2e in 2020

0.09 MMTCO2e in 2010
2.02 MMTCO2e in 2020

Total CO2 emissions in Connecticut from the electricity sector do not change in 2010, but
they will decline by 0.46 MMTCO2e in 2015 and by 1.33 MMTCO2e in 2020. CO2
emissions therefore decline from reference­case levels by 5.3 percent in 2015 and 11.6
percent in 2020.
Through 2010, no additional capacity is added in Connecticut. Through 2020, 409 MW
of projected fossil­fired capacity in Connecticut would be displaced by the construction
of 204 MW of biomass­fired IGCC and additional capacity construction outside the State.
The cumulative combined­cycle capacity built decreases from 656 MW to 470 MW,
while the coal IGCC falls from 825 MW to 602 MW. The total cumulative capacity
added in 2015 increases to 817 MW; the cumulative capacity added through 2020 falls to
1,456 MW, which is 205 MW below the projected capacity in the reference case.

Note – this recommended action is a combined renewable energy policy strategy that includes: Renewable
Portfolio Standards (RA 46), Government Clean Energy Purchase (RA 47), and Production Tax Credit (RA 48).
The stakeholders ran this scenario as a combined IPM scenario to inform the judgment of the group in its
decision­making. No GHG emissions reductions will be reported towards the target for this recommended action.
There is no efficienct way of separating out the GHG emissions reductions associated with this combined policy
run and its individual components, therefore each policy recommendation’s associated GHG emissions reductions
are reported separately.

In 2010, the generation profile in Connecticut does not change. Generation from all fossil
sources declines by 8.7 percent in 2015 and 11.7 percent in 2020. Combined­cycle
generation decreases by 13.2 percent in 2015 and 6.2 percent in 2020; oil/gas steam­unit
generation increases by 120.5 percent in 2015; and coal IGCC generation falls by 27.0
percent in 2020. Total renewable generation increases dramatically by 354.3 percent in
2015 and 250.3 percent in 2020. Generation from biomass IGCC increases from zero to
1,432 GWh in both 2015 and 2020. Biomass IGCC accounts for nearly all the increase in
renewable generation, although wind generation increases by 11.1 percent in 2015. Total
in­state generation in 2020 decreases by 2.1 percent, and the proportion of generation
from renewable sources rises from 1.5 to 5.2 percent.
The average wholesale electricity price in Connecticut changes only slightly over the
forecast period. It does not change in 2010, but it decreases by 0.4 percent (–$0.13
/MWh) in 2015 and 0.2 percent (–$0.09/MWh) in 2020.
Average wholesale capacity prices increase by less than 0.1 percent in 2010 and then
decline by 0.2 percent in both 2015 and 2020.
Average wholesale firm power prices increase by less than 0.1 percent in 2010; they then
decrease by 0.3 percent in 2015 and 0.2 percent in 2020.
Compared with the reference case, total program and policy costs to Connecticut through
2020 increase by $253.91 million. Total cost changes by component are as follows:
­
Power expenditures: –$17.51 million

46. Renewable Portfolio Standard
Recommended Action:

Expand and extend the Renewable Portfolio Standard.

This recommendation involves increasing the required percentage for the State’s Renewable
Portfolio Standard (RPS). The existing RPS will require seven percent renewable content by
2010. The recommendation would extend the RPS through 2020 and increase the level of
renewable energy required to 20 percent by 2020 (see Table 46.1).

The Center for Clean Air Policy (CCAP) sponsored modelling to evaluate the costs and carbon
reductions of the electric sector policy recommendations. This modelling, using the IPM®
model, provided useful information about the policies, but the results must be interpreted
carefully to discern the benefits of the existing and expanded RPSs accurately. First,
Connecticut’s existing RPS was included in the Reference Case model run, along with a number
of other existing RPSs in the region. Thus, the results of the Renewable Energy Case do not
reveal the regional CO2 benefits of Connecticut’s existing RPS policy – only the expanded
policy. Second, the expanded RPS is modelled along with two other energy policies in a
“Renewable Energy Strategy,” making it difficult to discern the effect of the RPS alone. Finally,
it is important to note that all of the CO2 reductions occurring in the Renewable Energy Strategy
are attributable to the Connecticut programs, though these reductions take place at fossil­fired
power plants across the Northeast.

172



Below, we review the CCAP modelling results pertaining to the two Connecticut RPS policies
(existing and proposed).2
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reduction:
1.3 MMTCO2e in 2010 3
3.2 MMTCO2e in 2020 4
Connecticut’s Existing RPS
Connecticut’s existing RPS requires that an increasing percentage of the electricity consumed in
the State be generated by renewable resources. This percentage peaks at seven percent in the
year 2010. As noted, this policy was included in the Reference Case in the CCAP modelling.
Thus, the Reference Case CO2 emissions are lower than they would have been absent the
Connecticut RPS. There is no way to discern the CO2 benefits of the Connecticut RPS from the
modelling outputs. However, we can estimate the benefits of this policy using an assumed
marginal CO2 emission rate for the northeastern US.
The emission impacts of energy efficiency programs and renewable resources are commonly
estimated using system marginal emission rates, based on the idea that reduced demand for
energy reduces the operation of the marginal generating unit. Synapse has performed a number
of analyses evaluating system marginal emission rates, and based on this work, we have used a
marginal CO2 rate of 1,100 lb/MWh.5
This marginal emission rate reflects the fact that the CT RPS affects fossil­fired generators
primarily in New England (based on the IPM modelling results) but also in New York and the
Pennsylvania/New Jersey/Maryland Interconnection (PJM). Currently, marginal CO2 rates are
lower in New England than in PJM or New York, due to a larger percentage of gas­fired
generation in New England than in these other regions. (The CO2 emission rate of a gas­fired
combined­cycle plant is in the range of 850 lb/MWh, and that of a coal­fired power plant is in
the range of 2,000 lb/MWh.) The Table below shows the calculation of 1.3 MMTCO2e reduced
by Connecticut’s existing RPS in 2010.

An Expanded RPS in Connecticut
The Renewable Energy Strategy evaluated in the CCAP modelling included the expanded RPS
in Connecticut, as well as additional purchases of renewable energy from state agencies and a
Production Tax Credit (PTC) for renewable energy in the state. These three Connecticut policies
together result in reductions of 2.02 MMTCO2e throughout the region.
Because these policies were modelled together, it is impossible to discern exactly what the
impact would be of the RPS in isolation, however, the other two policies would likely have much
smaller impacts than the RPS. First, the large number of MWhs involved in the RPS represents
much greater demand than the state power purchases modelled, and the limited renewable
resources in Connecticut would limit the effect of the Connecticut PTC. (Indeed, the model only
adds two MW of wind in CT in this scenario.)
The CCAP report estimates the effect of the RPS alone at 1.25 MMTCO2e by estimating the
effects of the RPS with a marginal emission rate (similar to the calculation in Section 1 above)
and then reducing the result dramatically with a factor to account for “limited renewable
availability.” Considering the three Connecticut policies involved, however, this estimate
probably understates the effects of the RPS. A better estimate would probably come from simply
assuming that the RPS generated 90 percent of the reductions achieved by the three programs
together. This assumption yields an estimate of 1.8 MMTCO2e reduced by the expanded RPS.
Regardless of the exact portion of the emission reductions attributable to the RPS, it is clear that
all of the modelled reductions are attributable to the Connecticut policies, regardless of where in
the region the emission reductions occur. The figure below shows the reductions estimated in
Section 1 above for the existing RPS (in 2010) as well as the 1.8 MMTCO2e of additional
reductions from the expanded RPS, as estimated in Section 2.

and mercury emissions. Other potential co­benefits include greater fuel diversity; fuel cost
savings; and increased electric system reliability and security — as well as economic
development benefits.

This graph reflects the assumption that, as part of the existing RPS, Connecticut maintains a seven­percent RPS
between 2010 and 2020. Thus the benefits of the existing RPS grow slightly over this period, as Connecticut
electricity use grows.

47. Government Clean Energy Purchase
Recommended Action: Implement a Government Clean Energy Purchase program.
The State should increase its purchase of Class I renewable energy to 20 percent in 2010, 50
percent in 2020, and 100 percent in 2050.
To promote and encourage the deployment of renewable energy resources in the region (beyond
RPS requirements) by Connecticut businesses, municipalities, institutions, and households,
government can “lead by example” by purchasing increasing amounts of renewable energy. 7 The
adoption of a portfolio of strategies could yield a zero­cost solution. These strategies include the
following measures:
1. Use energy conservation savings to finance the premium for renewable energy. A shared
savings policy requires the Office of Policy and Management to rebate 50 percent of the
energy savings achieved by State agencies. The stakeholders recommend that the 50 percent
of the savings received by the State through this measure be earmarked for renewable energy
purchases. Clearly demonstrated energy savings (based on comparable kWh numbers from
year to year) could substantially finance the State purchase of renewable energy and help it
achieve the recommended goals. This strategy is coordinated with the RCI working group
and its recommendations for State government energy conservation targets.
2. Competitive power procurement. Deregulation offers State government the opportunity to
issue a competitive bid in the open market to achieve a reduced rate. Energy savings of 5 to
10 percent can be achieved through a competitive offer. The State could also specify
increasing quantities of renewable energy in its mix to achieve the recommended targets.
3. Supplemental environmental projects. Supplemental environmental projects (SEPs) can help
companies mitigate all or part of the penalties imposed as a result of air pollution violations.
SEPs are environmentally beneficial projects administered by the DEP that offer pollution
prevention, EE, green energy, and community­based programs. SEPs can reduce the
renewable premium, help finance renewable energy projects, and support the purchase of
green tags.

7

Renewable energy means Class I from one of the following sources: (1) renewable energy certificates
purchased in Delaware, Maryland, New England, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, (2) green
power offerings, or (3) onsite distributed­generation deployment at State facilities.

Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.08 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.21 MMTCO2e in 2020
The Office of Policy and Management (OPM) has provided annual energy usage data for State
government facilities for FYs 2001 and 2002. Data provided by OPM and the Connecticut Siting
Council show that State government energy consumption equates to roughly 2 percent of
Connecticut’s total, making it an important target for leading by example. Electricity costs
represent less than 0.5 percent of the general budget. The market size is estimated to be
650,000,000 kWh, including 34 State agencies and 18 State colleges and universities.
Government procurement has significant positive benefits in spurring market demand. State
government’s commitment to purchase renewable energy creates opportunities for clean energy
technology commercialization, energy reliability and security through distributed generation, and
economic development prospects for nascent industries in which Connecticut companies are
recognized leaders (e.g., fuel cells).

Progress - In Process
Executive Order 32 passed requiring state government and universities to purchase Class I
renewables: 20% by 2010, 50% by 2020, and 100% by 2050. OPM has hired a consultant to
update state building load profiles to assist the state in carrying out this measure.
There should be a minimum 20 percent government green power purchase by 2010 and 50
percent in 2020. A consultant has been hired to evaluate load curves and energy consumption
patterns at State facilities as a precursor to clean energy purchasing.

48. Production Tax Credit
Recommended Action:

Explore a production tax credit (PTC) for new Class I renewable
projects.

The State should explore a production tax credit (PTC; equal to $0.018/kWh for 10 years) for
new Class I renewable projects in Connecticut that are not covered by the federal renewable PTC
(i.e. fuel cells, solar, landfill gas, biomass, hydrogen, and small hydro). This would be a potential
mechanism to achieve RPS and promote development of in­state renewables in light of future
information on the availability of and competition for biomass resources.
A PTC can encourage the deployment of renewable energy resources in Connecticut; generators
in Connecticut should be provided a State PTC to complement the federal PTC. A Connecticut
PTC would cover Class I renewable energy resources constructed in Connecticut and not
covered by the federal program. Under this policy, projects eligible for the federal PTC (e.g.,
wind) would not receive State assistance, but ineligible projects (e.g., solar) would. A
Connecticut PTC would apply to projects constructed beginning in the year legislation was
passed and continue indefinitely. Projects would have to first seek federal assistance; if they did
not qualify, they would be eligible for the State tax credit. This policy should ensure that
renewables that are close to the margin economically will get built in Connecticut.
The Connecticut PTC would be for the same amount as the federal credit (currently
$0.018/kWh). Like the federal PTC, the credit period would be 10 years from the start of service.
Provision of PTC will be handled by the Department of Revenue Services for qualifying
projects.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
The PTC was quantified together with two other measures (government green power purchase
and RPS) as the RES using the IPM model (see the summary of the RES scenario for joint
quantification estimates).

Progress – In Process
Although not directly a Connecticut­based production tax credit, P.A. 03­135 requires
Connecticut Light and Power (CL&P) and United Illuminating (UI) to sign long­term PPA’s for
no less than 100 MW of clean energy. This unprecedented act requires that contracts for no less
than a 10­year period (the length of the federal PTC is 10­years) be signed at a wholesale market
price plus up to $0.055 per kWh (the federal PTC is inflation adjusted at a rate of $0.015 per
kWh).
The implementation of this public policy requires:
1. Evaluation and recommendation of project feasibility and qualification by the
Connecticut Clean Energy Fund;
2. Negotiation of contracts by CL&P and UI; and
3. Approval of contracts by the Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control.
Actions taken to date include:
§

Connecticut Department of Public Utility Control conducted a proceeding that
established a procedure and process guidelines to implement the statute.

§

Connecticut Clean Energy Fund organized a kick­off meeting to prospective developers
and financiers to discuss the process and issue a draft RFP for public comment.

This act, in its current design, exceeds the benefits offered to clean energy developers and
financiers through a federal PTC model, however, project siting is currently designated to the
statutory region of the Northeast and not restricted to only Connecticut, which this
recommendation was based on.
The need to develop a Connecticut­based PTC will depend upon how PA 03­135 is successfully
implemented.

49. Clean Energy Option
Recommended Action:

Provide a clean energy option to ratepayers and default customers.

The State should establish and launch a clean energy option for all ratepayers and default
customers pursuant to SB 733 by January 1, 2005. The clean energy option targets recommended
by the renewable energy subcommittee are as follows: 3 to 4 percent by 2010; 5 to 10 percent by
2020; and 11 to 20 percent by 2050. These targets exceed the RPS requirements.
To promote and encourage the deployment of renewable energy resources in the region (beyond
RPS requirements), Connecticut ratepayers should be able to choose where their power comes
from through one or more clean energy option offerings. Several years ago, two competitive
power suppliers offered Green­e certified renewable energy products: Green Mountain Energy
and the Connecticut Energy Cooperative. At their peak, the two providers were satisfying less
than 0.1 percent of the market with a renewable energy product based on the number of
ratepayers being served. Currently, no clean energy offerings are available to Connecticut
ratepayers. The implementation of clean energy offerings would therefore provide choices for
Connecticut ratepayers while improving the portfolio of renewable energy strategies to support
market development and deployment of clean­energy technologies.
The recommended targets for clean energy option offerings are as follows:
§
§
§

3 to 4 percent by 2010
5 to 10 percent by 2020
11 to 20 percent by 2050

Note that these targets exceed the RPS requirements. In other words, by 2010, 10 percent of the
power supply will come from Class I and Class II renewable energy resources through the RPS,
and 3 to 4 percent of ratepayers will be supplied by 100 percent renewable energy (90 percent
more than is required by the RPS for this block of customers) through competitive offering(s)
explicitly purchased by them.
The program would be administered by the Alternative Transitional Standard Offer Providers
Connecticut Light and Power (CL&P) or United Illuminating (UI) and by any competitive power
supplier offering clean energy choice product(s) in the marketplace.
§

Consumer Education and Outreach Program. Research indicates that a continuous
commitment to marketing green offerings contributes to program success. The Consumer
Education and Outreach Program, managed by Department of Public Utility Control
(DPUC), should set aside a portion of its funding to specifically inform ratepayers about

181



§

green offerings. Strategic funding efforts by DPUC to capable organizations operating in
Connecticut can improve upon the effectiveness and efficiency of education and outreach
programs.
Connecticut Clean Energy Fund (CEF). The CEF, through its existing education and
outreach initiatives, will provide support for the benefit of Connecticut ratepayers.

Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.43 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.81 MMTCO2e in 2020
The estimates are based on the output of the renewable IPM modeling run. The State energy­use
and fossil fuel emissions factors are taken from the run. The impact of the clean energy choice is
quantified by taking the minimum target level, as determined by the stakeholders for specified
years, adjusted for the expected generation source (renewable vs. nonrenewable) and multiplied
by the expected emission rate.
Estimated Costs
The range of cost premiums for renewable energy is based on the costs of the generation
technologies and fuels (e.g., wind, solar, biomass, landfill gas, fuel cells, hydrogen, etc.), pricing
pressures due to limited supplies in the Northeast, and natural gas prices. Cost estimates (Table
49.1) are based on projected consumption (kWh) and number of ratepayers as well as on the
estimated ranges of cost premiums for renewable energy.
It should be noted that these are voluntary purchases by Connecticut ratepayers and therefore
there is no direct cost to the state beyond program support to promote this program.

Illuminating and CL&P Customers” reached a decision. It is expected that there will be a Clean
Energy Choice provided to CL&P and UI customers in the 1st quarter of 2005. This REC
(renewable energy credit) based program will provide Connecticut residential, commercial, and
industrial ratepayers with a 50% or 100% electricity product made from clean energy resources.
The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, in partnership with SmartPower, has created a program
called “Connecticut’s Clean Energy Communities.” This program will provide “free” solar
photovoltaic (PV) systems for Connecticut cities and towns that: (1) commit to the 20% x 2010
Clean Energy Campaign, (2) sign­up local residents and businesses to the Clean Energy Choice,
and (3) allocate 100% of the electricity savings resulting from the “free” PV towards a local
purchase of clean energy. This program is designed to compliment the ATSO program and
support greater market penetration to achieve the recommended action targets.

50. Renewable Energy Credits
Recommended Action: Allow for renewable energy credit (REC) trading in the Northeast
Region to meet compliance and voluntary market requirements for
clean energy in Connecticut.
To meet the RPS, the clean energy choice, and state government clean energy purchase, allow
purchase of REC’s generated in New England as well as Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New
York, and Pennsylvania, assuming they have compatible certificate markets and mechanisms.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
There are no direct or indirect GHG emissions reductions associated with this measure.
However, what clean energy Connecticut creates as a result of regional REC trading through its
compliance and voluntary markets, it expects to count towards its GHG emissions reductions.
This assumes that a REC includes all associated environmental attributes.
Estimated Costs
There are no costs to this measure, however, this measure will reduce compliance costs to
ratepayers for the implementation of Connecticut’s RPS.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Estimated co­benefits associated with this recommended action have yet to be analyzed. By
developing clean energy projects upwind of Connecticut, significant public health co­benefits are
anticipated as upwind state pollution is naturally transported and deposited into Connecticut
causing poor air quality conditions.

51. Restore Clean Energy Fund
Recommended Action:

Restore funding for the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund

This recommended action calls for the restoration of the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund (CCEF)
to its full funding level of roughly $29 million annually, generated by a 1 mil per kWh surcharge
on electricity sales. The CCEF provides incentives for new renewable generation capacity and
pilot programs. Under business­as­usual (BAU), a total of $8.6 million in annual revenues from
the Fund will be diverted for other state budget purposes for each of fiscal years 2005–2011. The
potential greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction benefits associated with instead applying these
diverted funds to directly purchase Renewable Energy Credits, or leverage voluntary green
power purchases by commercial, industrial, and institutional entities in Connecticut are described
below. As an alternative, a scenario in which diverted funds are used to support distributed fuel
cell or renewable system installations in high value applications in Connecticut was also
evaluated.
Scenario 1: Leveraging Clean Energy Purchases
One potential use of diverted CCEF funds would be to directly purchase Renewable Energy
Credits (RECs) from renewable power generators. These generators could be located in
Connecticut or in other parts of the Northeast that have compatible generation reporting systems
and/or are participating in a common, region­wide GHG registry system. Potentially greater
GHG reductions could be achieved if, instead of directly purchasing RECs, CCEF funds were
used to leverage voluntary green power purchases by commercial, institutional and industrial
entities in Connecticut. In this case, $1 of CCEF funding could theoretically leverage more than
$1 of REC purchases. Importantly, for associated GHG reductions under either approach to be
additional to the BAU case, RECs purchased with CCEF funding would need to be retired and
could not be counted toward compliance with Connecticut’s renewable portfolio standard.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:
0.31 MMTCO2e in 2010
0.41 MMTCO2e in 2020
Table 51.1 below summarizes kWh of conventional electricity generation displaced by
renewable generation in 2010 and 2020 under different assumptions concerning the future price
of RECs. Table 51.2 summarizes corresponding GHG benefits in million metric tons of carbon
dioxide (CO2) equivalent per year for a range of scenarios combining different REC prices,
different leveraging ratios of state to private funds, and different assumptions about the
emissions characteristics of power displaced by the renewable generation associated with each
REC. In both tables, results are shown for 2020 to illustrate the potential benefits of continued
185



CCEF funding over a longer timeframe, recognizing that the current program, current funding
levels, as well as the planned diversion of funds from the current program, may not continue —
or may change — beyond 2011. Note that all of the calculations assume $1 million in annual
program implementation costs, such that the total remaining from otherwise diverted CCEF
funds to support additional REC purchases is $7.6 million per year. In the High Price case,
RECs are assumed to cost $13.50 per MWh in 2010 and $10.10 per MWh in 2020, whereas in
the Low Price case RECs are assumed to cost $8.20 and $2.40 per MWh in 2010 and 2020,
respectively. 8 Accordingly, the amount of conventional electricity generation displaced in 2010
ranges from 563 million kWh to 4,634 million kWh, depending on REC prices and on whether
and to what extent state funds are leveraged. The corresponding range for 2020 under worst case
to best case assumptions is 752–15,833 million kWh.

displaces conventional coal generation at an avoided emissions rate of 2000 lb/MWh; (2)
renewable generation displaces average utility generation at an avoided emissions rate of 1200
lb/MWh; and (3) renewable generation displaces natural gas combined­cycle generation at an
avoided emissions rate of 850 lb/MWh.

For 2010, Table 51.2 indicates a range of potential annual CO2 reductions from 0.22 million
metric tons CO2­equivalent (MMTCO2e) to as much as 4.20 MMTCO2e. The low end of this
range assumes no leveraging of state funds, avoided emissions corresponding to natural gas
combined­cycle generation, and a high price for RECs. The high end of this range assumes that
state funds are leveraged 5:1, avoided emissions correspond to a conventional coal power plant,
and REC prices are low. Corresponding costs for CO2 reductions in 2010 (assuming a total state
expenditure of $8.6 million/year for REC purchases and program implementation) range from as
much as $39.09 per metric ton to as little as $2.05 per metric ton.9 The range of potential
reductions for the same expenditure of CCEF funds in 2020 is larger, from 0.29–14.36
MMTCO2e, depending on whether conservative versus best­case assumptions are used
concerning leverage ratio, avoided emissions, and REC prices. Corresponding costs per metric
ton of CO2 reduction in 2020 range from a high of $29.66 to a low of $0.60. For purposes of this
summary, we take a conservative estimate of likely GHG reductions assuming direct state
purchase of RECs (i.e., no leveraging), high REC prices, and avoided emissions at the average
utility rate of 1200 lbs/MWh. This yields estimates for 2010 and 2020 emissions reductions of
0.31 and 0.41 MMTCO2e, respectively. Corresponding cost­effectiveness figures for these two
years are $27.74 and $20.97 per metric ton, respectively.

Scenario 2: Promoting Distributed Fuel Cell or Renewable Installations in Connecticut
If used to purchase RECs, CCEF funds may in many cases support renewable energy projects
outside the state of Connecticut. Accordingly, there may be a preference for instead using these
9

Note that these cost­per­ton figures include only cost to the state but take full credit for resulting reductions. In
cases where state funds are leveraged, total public and private costs per ton of CO2 reduction range from as much
as $31.76/ton to as low as $5.65/ton where RECs are assumed to be displacing natural gas combined cycle
generation and from $13.50/ton to $2.40/ton where RECs are assumed to be displacing conventional coal
generation.
187



funds to promote distributed fuel cell or renewable system installations in high value applications
inside the state. Specifically, CCEF funds could be used to “buy down” the cost of on­site fuel
cell installations on suitable facilities in locations where distributed generation has high value to
the transmission and distribution (T&D) system; in this case, areas of southwest Connecticut
where T&D is constrained. An initial analysis suggests that the potential CO2 reductions
associated with this use of otherwise­diverted CCEF funds (again assuming annual program
implementation costs of $1 million per year) total approximately 9,000 metric tons of CO2 per
year or less than 0.01 MMTCO2e per year, considerably less than the range of potential
reductions associated with REC purchases as described above. This approach would also be far
less cost­effective from a GHG reduction standpoint, costing as much as $950 per metric ton of
CO2 reduction. It should also be noted, however, that these results are highly sensitive to input
assumptions, including the financing terms that would apply to such projects, the price of natural
gas, and the value of reliability benefits to the host facility. The assumptions used for purposes of
this analysis suggest that the CCEF would need to provide a rebate of approximately $2,150 per
kW to make distributed fuel cell installations cost­effective; associated CO2 benefits are
calculated assuming average avoided utility emissions of 1200 lbs/MWh.
Estimated Costs
Estimated program implementation costs for either approach evaluated under this Recommended
Action are assumed to total $1 million per year. If CCEF funds are leveraged to promote
voluntary green power purchases, commercial, industrial, and institutional consumers in
Connecticut would be expected to spend as much as $7.6 million annually on RECs in the 2:1
leverage case and $30.4 million in the 5:1 leverage case. If CCEF funds are used to buy down the
cost of fuel cell installations, the buy­down would presumably be structured such that
installations are cost­effective after the incentive is applied so that there are no additional costs in
Connecticut.
Estimated Co-Benefits
By virtue of reducing conventional power plant production, increased utilization of renewable
resources and new distributed fuel­cell installations would yield a number of additional pollutant
benefits in terms of reduced SO2, NOx, and mercury emissions. Other potential co­benefits
include greater fuel diversity; fuel cost savings; and increased electric system reliability and
security — as well as economic development benefits. These benefits are, of course, more likely
to be concentrated in Connecticut if CCEF funds are used to promote renewable projects or fuel
cell applications within the state. Accordingly, the state may wish to pursue a blended approach
in which some funds are used to purchase RECs from a region­wide market (thereby yielding
maximum GHG benefits, as indicated by the foregoing analysis), while remaining funds are used
to leverage in­state fuel cell or renewable energy projects.

52. Energy Efficiency and Combined Heat and Power
Recommended Action:

Implement a package of energy efficiency and combined heat and
power (CHP) measures.

All measures identified and assessed by the RCI and AFW working groups that result in
electricity demand reductions are included in the EE package for the IPM model run. The
measures include appliance standards, an appliance­swapping program, a heat pump and water
heater (HPWH) replacement program, bulk purchasing of appliances, mandatory upgrades to
commercial and residential building codes, energy efficiency and energy improvement
mortgages, a weatherization program, an Energy Star homes program, high­performance schools
and State­funded buildings, high­performance commercial buildings, a shared savings program
for government buildings and benchmarking, training of building operators, a green campus
initiative, a benchmarking and tracking program for municipal buildings, third­party load
management, combined heat and power, restoration of the Conservation and Load Management
Fund, installation of centralized manure digesters, and an urban tree­planting program.
Estimated GHG emissions reductions:10
0.25 MMTCO2e in 2010
4.90 MMTCO2e in 2020
For the 10­state region, the emissions­reduction estimates are
1.17 MMTCO2e in 2010
3.86 MMTCO2e in 2020
This program includes demand­side reductions made in the RCI and AFW sectors and measures
to encourage combined heat and power. The IPM model was used to quantify this package.
Demand was assumed to be reduced by 3 percent in 2006, increasing to a 14 percent reduction in
2020. The measures and the costs of implementing them were developed within the stakeholder
process.

Total CO2 emissions in Connecticut from the electricity sector will decline by 0.25

Note – this recommended action is a combined energy efficiency and CHP policy strategy that includes: numerous
measures from the RCI sector. The stakeholders ran this scenario as a combined IPM scenario to inform the
judgment of the group in its decision­making. No GHG emissions reductions will be reported towards the target
for this recommended action. There is no efficienct way of separating out the GHG emissions reductions
associated with this combined policy run and its individual components, therefore each policy recommendation’s
associated GHG emissions reductions are reported separately.

emissions therefore decline from reference­case levels by 3.5 percent in 2010, 12.3
percent in 2015, and 42.8 percent in 2020.
Through 2010, no additional capacity is added in Connecticut. Through 2020, the
cumulative combined­cycle capacity built decreases by 484 MW, and the coal IGCC falls
from 825 MW to zero. The total additional cumulative capacity projected to be built
therefore decreases to only 314 MW in 2015 and 352 MW in 2020. Total projected
capacity additions decline due to the decrease in generation levels resulting from
increased energy efficiency.
Generation in Connecticut from combined­cycle units decreases significantly, falling by
1.1 percent in 2010, 27.5 percent in 2015, and 25.3 percent in 2020. Coal IGCC
generation falls to zero in 2020; generation from oil/gas steam units falls to zero in 2010,
increases by 120.5 percent in 2015, and rises from zero to 244 GWh in 2020. Generation
from renewable sources does not change. Total in­state generation falls by 1.7 percent in
2010, 8.6 percent in 2015, and 21.0 percent in 2020; fossil generation decreases by 4.2
percent in 2010, 18.9 percent in 2015, and 43.1 percent in 2020.
Average wholesale electricity prices in Connecticut decrease slightly: by 0.9 percent (–
$0.28 /MWh) in 2010 and 0.3 percent (–$0.12/MWh) in 2015. In 2020, however,
wholesale electricity prices increase by 1.3 percent ($0.45/MWh).
Average wholesale capacity prices decrease by less than 0.1 percent in 2010, 0.6 percent
in 2015, and 12.6 percent in 2020.
Average wholesale firm power prices decrease slightly throughout the forecast period,
falling by 0.8 percent in 2010, 0.4 percent in 2015, and 1.3 percent in 2020.
Compared with the reference case, total program and policy costs to Connecticut through
2020 decrease by $481.26 million. Total cost changes by component are as follows:
­
Power expenditures: –$1,108.26 million
­
Renewable premium: –$10.56 million

53. Regional Cap-and-Trade Program
Recommended Action:

Work with other northeastern states to develop a regional cap-andtrade program.

Connecticut should work with other northeastern states through continued participation in the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and/or the New England Governors’ Conference
process to develop a regional cap­and­trade program for the electricity generation sector. These
processes should use existing NEG targets as applied to the electricity generation sector as a
starting point for recommended cap levels and timing (1990 emission levels by 2010 and 10
percent below 1990 levels by 2020). Given the results of advanced modeling by IPM in
Connecticut that predict substantial loss of emissions benefits due to offsetting increases in
emissions (i.e., “leakage”) inside and outside the region (in Pennsylvania and the eastern
interconnect region), Connecticut should support the design of a program covering the broadest
possible geographical region and the widest range of potential sources and develop policy
mechanisms to control offsetting emissions (such as a generation performance standard, offsets,
or other approaches). In addition, Connecticut should support development of an effective
federal cap­and­trade program for electricity generation sector.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Where Applicable)
The CCAP modelling of a regional cap­and­trade program provides a useful estimate of the
regional impacts of such a program. However, the final CCAP report focuses on the CO2
reduction impacts of the program within Connecticut. Focusing on emission changes in
Connecticut only is inappropriate given the regional nature of the electric power system.
Because electricity is provided via an interconnected, regional grid, generators outside of
Connecticut commonly serve Connecticut customers, and generators in Connecticut commonly
serve users in other northeastern states. Thus, the impact of any electric­sector actions taken by
Connecticut consumers will be regional in scale. However, it is even more critical to view the
results of a cap­and­trade program regionally, as this is a regionally implemented program.
Electricity consumers across the entire capped region would fund the emission reductions
achieved by the power generating sector, and the generating sector would achieve those
reductions where it was most efficient.
Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Connecticut portion of the regional
savings – with leakage)
Estimated GHG emissions reduction:
0.95 MMTCO2e in 2010
2.26 MMTCO2e in 2020

192



Results of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond (Connecticut portion of regional
savings – without leakage)
Estimated GHG emissions reduction:
1.98 MMTCO2e in 2010
5.13 MMTCO2e in 2020
For a discussion of “leakage,” see the “Supplemental Information” section below. Regarding the
leakage observed in the modelling, the final CCAP report notes: “leakage of power generation to
areas outside the capped region is often a problem in cap­and trade scenarios. To counteract
leakage, a Generation Performance Standard (GPS) may be implemented with the cap. The GPS
sets a level of emissions permissible for power imports. By limiting leakage, the performance of
the cap­and­trade mechanism may be improved.”11
One could estimate the portion of total CO2 savings attributable to Connecticut using either the
state’s fraction of the cost of implementing the cap or its fraction of total regional energy use
under the cap. In fact, if the costs of the program were spread evenly across the region, these
fractions would be the same. The modelling results show that, indeed, the increase in
Connecticut wholesale electricity prices is very close to the average increase in prices across the
capped region. Thus, Connecticut’s fraction of total energy use is a very accurate proxy for its
fraction of total costs.
While there is not a direct link between the costs paid by specific consumers in a cap­and­trade
program and the CO2 reductions at any specific power plant, Connecticut consumers would
clearly pay for a significant portion of the costs of a regional carbon cap. This fact is reflected in
the modelling results, as the cost of wholesale electricity increases in Connecticut as well as in
the other states participating in the cap. Therefore, a reasonable way to estimate the benefits of
Connecticut’s participation in this program is based on Connecticut consumer’s share of the total
program costs.
The table below shows the calculation of the CO2 savings attributable to Connecticut’s
participation in the cap­and­trade program, using the state’s fraction of total regional energy use
to apportion emissions. This table shows Connecticut’s portion of the actual modelled
reductions (0.95 MMTCO2e in 2010 and 2.26 MMTCO2e in 2020) and the state’s portion of the
reductions that would have occurred had there been no “leakage” (2.0 MMTCO2e in 2010 and
5.1 MMTCO2e in 2020). If the cap­and­trade program were implemented along with policies to
minimize leakage, the savings attributable to Connecticut would probably fall between these
“with leakage” and “without leakage” numbers.

Estimated Costs
From CT’s IPM runs:
§ Average wholesale electricity prices in Connecticut increase significantly over the
forecast period, rising by 8.6 percent ($2.58/MWh) with respect to the reference case in
2010, 9.1 percent ($3.12/MWh) in 2015, and 13.8 percent ($4.84/MWh) in 2020.
§ Average wholesale capacity prices increase by 19.5 percent in 2010 and 0.8 percent in
2015; they fall by 3.2 percent in 2020.
§ Average wholesale firm power prices increase significantly throughout the forecast
period, rising by 10.2 percent in 2010, 7.7 percent in 2015, and 10.6 percent in 2020.
Firm power prices increase in 2020 because the increase in wholesale electricity prices
outweighs the fall in capacity prices
§ The CO2 allowance price for the 10­state region increases over the forecast period in the
policy case, rising from $7.38/metric ton in 2010 to $9.59/metric ton in 2015 to
$12.11/metric ton in 2020.
It should be noted that updated IPM runs currently being conducted by RGGI will provide
revised cost figures.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Reductions in emissions of NOx, SO2 and Hg are often realized when CO2 reductions are
achieved from electricity generating units. The magnitude of the estimated reductions of these
pollutants will be known when updated modelling runs are completed as part of the RGGI
process.

12

These numbers reflect compliance with the modeled cap of 217 million tons (197 MMTCO2e) in 2020. In the
CCAP modeling study, a number of offset credits equal to 10% of the 2020 cap were allowed to be used in lieu of
CO2 reductions from capped electricity generating units.
194



Progress – In Process
Continuing participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and coordination
with other states in the northeast region. The goal is to have electricity sector modelling results
and a model rule completed by April 2005. A RGGI Staff Working Group meeting is held
monthly, and numerous sub­group conference calls are held each month.
RGGI will be using the same electricity sector model (IPM) that was used during the CT
Stakeholder process. Model assumptions and inputs (e.g., participating states, unit applicability
threshold, use of offsets, cap size and timing, fuel costs, renewable energy available curves, etc)
will differ from those used in the CT process, so a direct comparison with CT modelling results
will not be possible. One area of interest when the new results are available will be the
magnitude of the leakage issue.
Once a model rule is created and finalized by RGGI, CT DEP will need to promulgate a
regulation if it is decided to move ahead and implement this program.
Supplemental Information
Much more information on the RGGI process can be found at http://www.rggi.org/index.htm.
During the Connecticut Stakeholder dialog, leakage was identified as an area of concern.
Leakage results when the adoption of a cap­and­trade program leads to a rise in imports of
electricity into the region or state covered by the cap, in turn increasing emissions outside the
region and diminishing the net emission­reduction benefits achieved. Stakeholders stressed that
although cap­and­trade is effective as a regional policy, it is not very effective as a state­only
policy (in part due to concerns over leakage). It was felt that Connecticut should therefore avoid
implementing a Connecticut­only cap­and­trade program. It was further decided that Connecticut
should embrace the RGGI process and should pursue a regional cap­and­trade program with as
broad a geographic range (including the RGGI states or even the Eastern Interconnect region)
and as many sources as possible.

55. Emissions Inventory and Registry
Recommended Action:

Create appropriate tools for an effective inventory, reporting
system, and registry of State emissions.

Connecticut should create appropriate tools for an effective inventory, reporting system, and
registry of State emissions. The system should support the State’s target, action plan, and
regional leadership role—including mutual recognition by other jurisdictions. The State should
explore working with the NEG/ECP on this effort. Development of such a system may include
the following actions:
§
§
§
§

Creating an annual state­wide GHG emissions inventory and related State inventories
Instituting mandatory reporting of GHG emissions by appropriate sources
Developing a voluntary GHG emissions registry
Working with other states and regions on consistent and mutually recognized approaches
for inventory and reporting.

Result of Assessments for 2010, 2020, and Beyond
GHG emissions reductions have not been estimated.
Estimated Costs
There will be shared costs for establishing and running a regional registry. Final costs and
potential funding mechanisms are still being evaluated.
Estimated Co-Benefits
Co­benefits have not been estimated.
Progress – In Process
CT DEP is working with other northeast states and NESCAUM on the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Registry (RGGR) project. The goal is to develop a GHG registry that can accommodate both
mandatory and voluntary reporting programs. This registry is also being designed to handle the
emissions and allowance tracking needs of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI).
Pursuant to Public Act 04­252 (A.A.C. Climate Change), Connecticut sources will need to
commence mandatory reporting of annual GHG emissions in April 2006.

about the solutions and impacts of global warming.

The stakeholder group strongly supports measures to foster a broad awareness of climate change
issues (including co­benefit issues, such as clean air and public health) and effects among
Connecticut’s citizens and to engage citizens in simple actions to reduce GHG emissions. The
measures, detailed below, are cross­cutting and provide a foundation for the implementation of
all the mitigation actions proposed in this report. The measures seek to integrate with and build
on existing outreach efforts involving climate change and co­benefit issues in Connecticut.
The following actions are recommended to ensure success of the specific education and outreach
measures proposed below:
1. Include the Commissioners of Education and Higher Education on the Governor’s Steering
Committee on climate change.
2. Establish an ongoing Climate Change Education Committee to develop broad awareness of
climate change issues and to implement the education and outreach measures proposed in
this report. Participation in the committee should be open to interested parties from all
sectors, including State agencies, educators, community­based organizations, businesses and
institutions, municipalities, and universities. The work of the committee should include the
following components:
­
Implementation of the initiatives to implement the education and outreach measures
proposed below

establish procedures that promote, to the greatest extent feasible, the procurement and use
of recycled products and environmentally preferable products, [and] services, and
practices by state agencies. The department shall: (1) Designate environmentally
preferable products, taking into consideration the raw materials acquisition, production,
manufacturing, packaging, distribution, reuse, operation, maintenance or disposal aspects
of such products, and establish minimum standards and specifications for their
procurement and use; (2) when feasible, include the use of environmentally preferable
products and services as a criteria in a multiple criteria bid or an evaluation factor in
requests for proposals; and (3) consider the use of environmentally preferable business
practices when reviewing the overall performance of a bidder or proposer's business
operation. Such procedures shall not be considered regulations, as defined in section 4­
166.
(c) [Within available appropriations] Not later than January 1, 2005, and annually
thereafter, the department shall: (1) Develop and maintain information about
environmentally preferable products, [and] services and practices procured through the

jurisdiction by the town of West Haven and any undesignated grounds, within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the state, for the purpose of planting and cultivating shellfish.
The authority herein conferred shall include the Cormell Reef, Portchester, Great
Captain's Island, Field Point and Greenwich Point natural beds as located and described
in section 3295 of the general statutes, revision of 1918. Any person desiring to lease
grounds for such purpose shall make application in writing to the commissioner and all
grounds leased by authority of the provisions of this section shall be leased to the highest
responsible bidder, for a minimum fee of two dollars per acre. Such lease or lease
renewal shall require the lessee to make a good faith effort to cultivate and harvest
shellfish from the leased area. Such lease or lease renewal shall prohibit the lessee from
entering a contract whereby the lessee agrees not to cultivate and harvest shellfish for any
period of time. No lessee may enter an agreement with a third party that will prevent the
lessee from carrying out the lessee's obligations under the lease unless the Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Protection and the Attorney General have approved such
agreement. The form of such application and lease shall be approved by the Attorney
General, and all such leases shall be recorded in the records of the commissioner. No
lease shall be granted to a resident of a state which does not lease shellfish grounds to
residents of this state, except that any nonresident who was granted a lease on or before
October 1, 1985, may, upon the expiration of such lease, apply for a renewal or further
lease as provided in this section. The commissioner shall grant any such lease to
nonresidents upon the same terms and conditions as to residents of this state. Any lessee
or holder of oyster ground, on the expiration of any lease thereof which has been or
which may be granted, shall, upon application to the commissioner, have the preference
in the reletting of such ground for a like term to that granted in the original lease, unless
such applicant, at the time for granting such application, is in arrears for rent on the

227



original lease of such ground. Such application for such renewal or further lease shall be
granted without notice or advertisement of the pendency thereof; provided no renewal or
further lease of such ground shall be granted when the commissioner, for cause, ceases to
lease such ground for oyster culture. All assignments or transfers of leases shall be
subject to the approval of the commissioner and shall be recorded in his records. Any
person who interferes with, annoys or molests another in the enjoyment of any lease
authorized by the provisions of this section shall be subject to the penalties provided in
section 26­237. The provisions of sections 26­212, as amended, 26­215, as amended, and
26­232, as amended, shall not apply to any shellfish grounds leased pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any owner of a utility
line or public use structure that impacts on a leased area shall pay to the lessee the costs
of removing or relocating any shellfish. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
prohibit the state or any lessee from recovering damages incurred by the state or the
lessee caused by the installation, construction or presence of such utility line or public
use structure.
(c) The Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer Protection shall assess the owner of
any facility that requires a certificate issued pursuant to section 16­50k, as amended, or

Executive Summary
The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) contracted Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) to
perform an economic assessment of a feebates program in the State of Connecticut. The focus of the
program was to promote the purchase of more fuel-efficient cars by placing a feebate (surcharge) on
high-fuel-consumption vehicles and a rebate on fuel-efficient cars.
The feebate program is intended to be self-sustaining; the monetary amount of rebates given to
fuel-efficient vehicle purchasers would equal the amount of feebates received from high-fuelconsumption vehicle purchasers. Included in the feebates would be the cost for the State of
Connecticut to implement the program. Consequently, there will not be any government spending to
stimulate the economy. All economic stimulation is the result of a decrease in the demand for
gasoline. As sales of fuel-efficient vehicles increase, the demand for gasoline decreases. The increase
in consumer spending on other goods is the result of consumers having more money from
purchasing less gasoline. This will cause a loss in revenue for gasoline stations and consequentially
the State of Connecticut will lose the revenue from tax on gasoline.
EPA asked REMI to model the total economic and demographic impacts in Connecticut due to
the implementation of the feebate program over a 15-year time horizon from 2005 to 2020. To
quantify the indirect and induced effects of the policies, REMI captured all direct effects of the
policies, including:
·

The increase on consumer spending on other goods

·

A loss in revenue for gasoline stations

·

A loss in tax revenue for the State of Connecticut

REMI examined the above scenarios using a 53-industry-sector, single-region model for the State
of Connecticut. Using this model REMI developed an underlying baseline forecast and an alternative
forecast of the economic impacts of the feebates program.
Data for the analysis was provided by the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management
(NESCAUM), who provided REMI with projections of total costs and benefits of the feebates
program. Data for this analysis was also provided by: Environment Northeast, Environmental
Defense, Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Connecticut Department of Environmental
Protection, and the Connecticut Department of Revenue Services.

Major Findings
Table 1 shows the economic growth on the State of Connecticut is shown due to the feebates
program. Table 1 shows the cumulative growth of Connecticut over the 14-year time period.

*Employment is the average annual increase from the baseline. Employment is not cumulative and is based on
output growth.

Enacting a feebates program in the State of Connecticut would stimulate positive growth on the
economy. It would create roughly 22 new jobs in the economy mainly in the service retail trade
industries and population would increase by roughly 44 people. By 2020, total Output in the State of
Connecticut would grow by $44.815 million, and Gross State Product would grow by $13.108
million. However, there will also be some negative effects on the State of Connecticut. The State of
Connecticut will lose $29.523 million in tax revenue by 2020, roughly $2.1 million per year, resulting
in a loss in government employment, roughly 27 jobs.
Table 2 and Table 3 show the annual increase for two specific years, 2010 and 2020. These graphs are
not an accumulation of preceding years, but instead show how much growth Connecticut would
experience that single year. Both years follow a similar trend; growth in Employment, Output, GSP,
Population, and Real Disposable Income; and a loss in State Revenues. Between 2006, 2010, 2020,
there is a linear increase (in the case of state revenues, a decrease) for all economic variables. For a
detailed description of each variable please see section 2.

1 Methodology & Assumptions
1-1 REMI Policy Insight
REMI Policy Insight® is the leading regional economic-forecasting and policy-analysis model. For
this study, REMI developed Policy Insight for the State of Connecticut. REMI built this model using
the REMI model building system, which consists of hundreds of programs developed over the last
two decades. The system assembled the State of Connecticut model using data from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Energy, the Bureau of Census,
and other public sources.
REMI Policy Insight is a structural model, meaning that it clearly includes cause-and-effect
relationships. The model is based on two key underlying assumptions from mainstream economic
theory: households maximize utility and producers maximize profits. Since these assumptions make
sense to most people, lay people as well as trained economists can understand the model.
In the model, businesses produce goods to sell to other firms, consumers, investors, governments
and purchasers outside the region. The output is produced using labor, capital, fuel, and intermediate
inputs. The demand for labor, capital and fuel per unit of output depends on their relative costs,
since an increase in the price of any one of these inputs leads to substitution away from that input to
other inputs. The supply of labor in the model depends on the number of people in the population
and the proportion of those people who participate in the labor force. Economic migration affects
the population size. People will move into an area if the real after-tax wage rates or the likelihood of
being employed increases in a region.
Supply and demand for labor in the model determines the wage rates. These wage rates, along with
other prices and productivity, determine the cost of doing business for every industry in the model.
An increase in the cost of doing business causes either an increase in prices or a cut in profits,
depending on the market for the product. In either case, an increase in costs would decrease the
share of the local and U.S. market supplied by local firms. This market share combined with the
demand described above determines the amount of local output. Of course, the model has many
other feedbacks. For example, changes in wages and employment impact income and consumption,
while economic expansion changes investment and population growth impacts government
spending.
Figure 1-1 is a pictorial representation of REMI Policy Insight. The Output block shows a
business that sells to all the sectors of final demand as well as to other industries. The Labor and
Capital Demand block shows how labor and capital requirements depend both on output and their
relative costs. Population and Labor Supply contribute to demand and to wage determination.
Economic migrants in turn respond to wages and other labor market conditions. Supply and demand
interact in the Wage, Price and Profit block. Prices and profits determine market shares. Output
depends on market shares and the components of demand.

237



Figure 1-1 REMI Policy Insight overview

The REMI model brings together all of the above elements to determine the value of each of the
variables in the model for each year in the baseline forecast. The model includes all the inter-industry
interactions that are included in input-output models in the Output block, but goes well beyond an
input-output model by including the linkages among all of the other blocks shown in Figure 1-1.
In order to broaden the model in this way, it was necessary to estimate key relationships. This was
accomplished by using extensive data sets covering all areas in the country. These large data sets and
two decades of research effort have enabled REMI to simultaneously maintain a theoretically sound
model structure and build a model based on all the relevant data available.
The model has strong dynamic properties, which means that it forecasts not only what will happen
but also when it will happen. This results in long-term predictions that have general equilibrium
properties. This means that the long-term properties of general equilibrium models are preserved
while maintaining accurate year-by-year predictions and estimating key equations using primary data
sources.
Figure 1-2 shows the policy simulation process for a scenario called Policy X. The effects of a
scenario are determined by comparing the baseline REMI forecast with an alternative forecast that
incorporates the assumptions for the scenario. The baseline REMI forecast uses recent data and
thousands of equations to generate projected economic activity for a particular region. The policy
variables in the model are set equal to their baseline value (typically zero for additive variables and

238



one for multiplicative variables) when solving for the baseline forecast. To show the effects of a
given scenario, these policy variables are given values that represent the direct effects of the scenario.
The alternative forecast is generated using these policy variable inputs. Figure 1-2 shows how this
process would work for a policy change called Policy X.

1-2 Assumptions
For this project, REMI examined the economic effects of oil and natural gas conservation policies in
the State of Connecticut. REMI made the following assumptions:
1. As fuel-efficient vehicles become more prevalent, there is a decrease in the amount of gas
purchased.
2. Any drop in consumer spending saved due to buying less gasoline is reallocated onto other
goods.
3. Given the self-sustaining nature of the feebates program, the number of high-fuel consumption
vehicles sold equals the number of fuel-efficient vehicles sold.
4. High-fuel consumption vehicles are equal in cost to fuel-efficient vehicles
5. There is a negligible loss on car dealerships. (based on assumptions 2 and 3)
6. All high-fuel-consumption vehicles sold in Connecticut are manufactured outside of
Connecticut. Consequently, any loss in motor vehicles sales will not reduce revenue for
Connecticut’s motor vehicle industry.
7. The feebates program is self-sufficient; the feebates collected for high-fuel-consumption vehicles
will equal the rebates given for fuel-efficient vehicles, plus the cost of program implementation.

1-3 Simulation Inputs
For simulation inputs please see Table 1-1.

Consumer Spending
As the ratio of fuel-efficient vehicles to high-fuel-consumption vehicles increases, the total quantity
of gasoline demanded by consumers decreases. REMI captured the decrease in demand by
decreasing consumer spending for gasoline. Approximately 40% of the loss in consumer spending
will affect the petroleum industry directly. This includes gasoline filling stations, distributors, etc..
Shown in ‘Consumer Spending on Gasoline’ on Table 1-1.

Consumption Reallocation
Consumption reallocation transfers the money saved from purchasing less gas to purchasing other
goods. The input is based on the assumption that all money saved from gas purchases will be spent
on other goods. Shown in ‘Consumption Reallocation’ on Table 1-1.

Government Spending
The feebates program is intended to be self-sufficient. There will not be any change in government
spending due to the implementation of the program, feebate collection, or rebate distribution.
However, there will be a loss in government spending due to a loss in state tax revenue on gas
collections. The government-spending variable does assume the government will offset the loss in
state tax revenue by decreasing the amount of government employees. (See section 2-3)

240



Gasoline Sales
The loss in demand for vehicle gasoline would directly affect the petroleum industry in Connecticut.
This includes gasoline distributors, filling stations, etc. This is entered into REMI Policy Insight as a
loss in exogenous final demand. To account for the loss in revenue for the petroleum industry
calculated in the consumer-spending variable, REMI subtracted the sales already calculated in Policy
Insight from the projected decrease in sales of the petroleum industry.

2 Results & Analysis
As shown in Table 2-1 enacting feebates policies in the State of Connecticut would stimulate positive
growth in the economy. It is important to note, however, that not all economic sectors would
benefit. There would be a loss in the government sector, roughly 27 jobs, and the petroleum
products sector, roughly $16.5 million in Output by 2020.

2-1 Output
The Output of an economy is the amount of production in dollars, including all intermediate goods
purchased as well as value-added (labor, capital, and fuel investments and profit). We can also think
of output as sales for both final goods and intermediate goods. Output is dependent upon
consumption in the area, state government spending, investment, and exports of the industries in the
region.
Due to the feebates program, Output would steadily grow during the projected timeframe. Starting in
2006, Output in the State of Connecticut would increase by $320 thousand. By 2020, Output would
increase $4.013 million with a cumulative total of $44.815 million. The industry sectors that would
experience the majority of the growth are the service sector, with a cumulative total of $27 million,
the finance sector, with $17 million, and the retail trade sector, with $13 million. The industry sectors
that would experience losses are the petroleum industry, with a cumulative lose of $16.5 million, and
the wholesale sector, with $12 million.

2-2 Gross State Product
Gross State Product (GSP) as a value added concept is analogous to the national concept of Gross
Domestic Product. It is equal to Output, excluding intermediate inputs. The value-add concept is
equal to compensation and profits.
GSP has a lower growth rate then Output due to the structure of GSP. GSP is calculated as the total
sales of all final goods sold in Connecticut. Gasoline is considered a final good product, and,
therefore, the demand loss for gasoline impacted GSP more than Output.
In 2006, GSP increases by $76 thousand. In 2020, GSP increases by $1.38 million with a cumulative
total of $13.108 million.

2-3 Employment
The Employment variable in REMI Policy Insight uses historical data from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) and is based upon place of work, including part-time and full-time employees. The
employment figures projected below are the difference from baseline and should not be cumulated.
There is a very slight increase in employment due to the feebates program. The majority of growth
occurs in the service and retail sectors. A slight decrease in employment occurs in the government
sector (roughly 27 jobs) due to the loss in tax revenue. Although there is a decrease in Output for the
petroleum industry, employment loss is very small and considered negligible.
In 2006, Employment increases by 2 workers. By 2020, Employment increases by 33 net new
workers.

2-4 Population
Population is a key variable in REMI Policy Insight that affects the potential labor force, government
spending, consumption spending, and housing prices. The changes in population are due to changes
in migration, the result of either economic growth or loss.
All changes in population are cumulative. Each year shows the difference from baseline, but includes
the previous year. The increase in Population occurs largely due to economic migration and families
moving with the migrants. Population does not start increasing till 2007, due to the lag time and the
fact that the initial employment increase was so small. In 2007, Population increases by 2 people. By
2020, the Population of the State of Connecticut will have increased by 44 people.

2-5 Real Disposable Income
Real Disposable Income is the inflation-adjusted income that is available for consumers to spend. It
is personal income minus taxes and social contributions plus dividends, rents, and transfer payments.
The numbers of employees in the area, their wage rate, and the consumer prices all affect real
Disposable Income. An increase in employment or wage, or a decrease in consumers’ prices increases
a region’s Real Disposable Income. Consequently, the opposite decreases Real Disposable Income.
The increase in Real Disposable Income is an indirect effect of the new jobs in Connecticut. The
summation of new wages, minus taxes, earned by workers equals the increase in Real Disposable
Income. Although there would be a decrease in the amount of spending on gasoline, there would be
no direct effect on Real Disposable Income; REMI assumed that any decrease in spending on
gasoline would be offset by an increase in spending on other goods.
In 2005, Real Disposable Income increases by $46 thousand. By 2020, Real Disposable Income
increases by $1.373 million with a cumulative total of $10.742 million.

2-6 State Revenue
State Revenue represents the gains or losses in income for the State of Connecticut from tax
revenues. These revenues include individual income tax, general sales tax, tobacco sales tax, and
property tax. All changes in state revenue are indirect effects only. It does not take into account the
changes in tax income from the oil and natural gas industry. All effects are the results of a change in
economic activity. Real Disposable Income and Population affect State Revenues directly.
Due to the feebates program there would be a loss in State Revenue for the State of Connecticut. All
revenue loss would be a direct effect of the demand loss in gasoline. Gasoline is a heavily taxed
commodity so any decrease in gasoline consumption decreases the amount of tax collected on
gasoline.
In 2006, the State of Connecticut loses $256 thousand in State Revenues. By 2020, the State of
Connecticut would lose $3.682 million dollars for a cumulative total of $29.523 million lost.

Executive Summary
The Environment Protection Agency (EPA) contracted Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) to
perform an economic assessment of oil and natural gas conservation programs in the State of
Connecticut. The focus of the study was on increasing efficiency of oil and natural gas for residential,
commercial, and industrial users. The efficiency increase is the result of research and consumer
education, and the implementation of energy-efficient equipment by users. Funding for the program
is derived from a 3% natural gas-use and oil-use surcharge on residential, commercial, and industrial
users.
EPA asked REMI to model the total economic and demographic impacts in Connecticut due to
the implementation of conservation policies over a 15-year time horizon from 2005 to 2020. To
quantify the indirect and induced effects of the policies, REMI captured all direct effects of the
policies, including:
·

The oil and natural gas costs increases for residential, commercial, and industrial users resulting
from the surcharge on oil and natural gas.

·

Savings to residential, commercial, and industrial users due to reduced consumption of natural
gas and oil.

·

Consumption reallocation of other consumer goods due to an increase in personal income.

·

Loss in sales to natural gas and oil firms due to reduced consumption

·

Investment in new equipment, construction, research, and other sectors.

REMI examined the above scenarios using a 53-industry-sector, single-region model for the State
of Connecticut. Using this model REMI developed an underlying baseline forecast and three
alternative forecasts. Two forecasts modeled oil and natural gas as separate policies and the third
forecast modeled oil and natural gas in combination. By analyzing the two policies separately and
then together, the underlying effects of the individual policies can be seen.
Data for the analysis was provided by: Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management
(NESCAUM), who provided REMI with projections of total costs and benefits to residential,
commercial and industrial users for both oil and natural gas. Data for this analysis was also provided
by: Environment Northeast, Institute for Sustainable Energy, Connecticut Department of Public
Utility Control, Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, and the Connecticut Clean
Energy Fund, and United Technology Corporation.

Major Findings
Table 1 summarizes the economic growth on the State of Connecticut due to the oil and natural gas
conservation policies. This table shows the cumulative growth of Connecticut over the 15-year time
period for all three alternative forecasts: oil, natural gas, and the combination of the two 1.

Employment (Avg Annual Increase)*

*Employment is the average annual increase from the baseline. Employment is not cumulative and is based on output growth.

Enacting conservation policies in Connecticut would stimulate positive growth on the economy. It
would create roughly 2,092 net new jobs in the Connecticut economy, mostly in the retail and service
sectors; and the population would increase by 3,604 people, mostly due to economic migration. By
2020, total Output in Connecticut would grow by $3.10 billion, total GSP would grow by $2.03
billion, and the State of Connecticut would collect approximately $382 million more in State
Revenues.
All sectors of the economy will experience strong growth during the time frame, with the exception
to the surprisingly small growth in Output. This effect occurs due to a high loss in demand and sales
for the petroleum industry in Connecticut (see section 2-1). The strong growth in employment,
largely in the service and retail sector, results from the decrease in fuel costs and the increase in Real
Disposable Income (the increase in Real Disposable Income directly affects the increase in
consumption). Please see section 2 for a detailed description of the results.
As shown in Table 1, the majority of the growth in the Connecticut economy occurs due to the
natural-gas conservation policy. The natural-gas conservation policy accounts for roughly 80% of the
growth in employment, 98% of the growth in output, 87% of the growth in GSP, 80% of the growth
in population, 83% of the growth in Real Disposable Personal Income, and 82% of the growth in
State Revenues. The disproportionate ratio between the oil and natural gas policies is due to the
higher loss in demand for petroleum than for natural gas. As shown in section 1-3 the loss in demand
of oil is almost 6 times higher than the loss in demand for natural gas.
Table 2 and Table 3 show the annual increases in economic growth for two specific years: 2010 and
2020. These graphs are not an accumulation of preceding years, but instead show how much growth
Connecticut would experience that year. In the majority of the economic variables; employment,
1 Please note: the results for the third forecast (oil and natural gas) are from the combination of oil and natural gas inputs into REMI

Policy Insight, not the combined outputs of forecasts 1(oil) and 2(natural gas). Consequently, the results of the third forecast may not
be the exact summation of outputs from he first and second forecast.

254



GSP, population, etc., there is a growth in the annual increase. The one exception is annual Output
growth in the oil policy scenario. Between 2010 and 2020 there is a decrease in annual Output
growth of $3.91 million. In 2020 there is a decrease in Output from the baseline of that year.
However, as shown in section 2-1, only two years in the oil policy scenario experience a decline. The
decline in Output for those years is relatively small and is made up in the natural gas scenario.

REMI Policy Insight® is the leading regional economic-forecasting and policy-analysis model. For
this study, REMI developed Policy Insight for the State of Connecticut. REMI built this model using
the REMI model building system, which consists of hundreds of programs developed over the last
two decades. The system assembled the State of Connecticut model using data from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Energy, the Bureau of Census,
and other public sources.
REMI Policy Insight is a structural model, meaning that it clearly includes cause-and-effect
relationships. The model is based on two key underlying assumptions from mainstream economic
theory: households maximize utility and producers maximize profits. Since these assumptions make
sense to most people, lay people as well as trained economists can understand the model.
In the model, businesses produce goods to sell to other firms, consumers, investors, governments
and purchasers outside the region. The output is produced using labor, capital, fuel, and intermediate
inputs. The demand for labor, capital and fuel per unit of output depends on their relative costs,
since an increase in the price of any one of these inputs leads to substitution away from that input to
other inputs. The supply of labor in the model depends on the number of people in the population
and the proportion of those people who participate in the labor force. Economic migration affects
the population size. People will move into an area if the real after-tax wage rates or the likelihood of
being employed increases in a region.
Supply and demand for labor in the model determines the wage rates. These wage rates, along with
other prices and productivity, determine the cost of doing business for every industry in the model.
An increase in the cost of doing business causes either an increase in prices or a cut in profits,
depending on the market for the product. In either case, an increase in costs would decrease the
share of the local and U.S. market supplied by local firms. This market share combined with the
demand described above determines the amount of local output. Of course, the model has many
other feedbacks. For example, changes in wages and employment impact income and consumption,
while economic expansion changes investment and population growth impacts government
spending.
Figure 1-1 is a pictorial representation of REMI Policy Insight. The Output block shows a
business that sells to all the sectors of final demand as well as to other industries. The Labor and
Capital Demand block shows how labor and capital requirements depend both on output and their
relative costs. Population and Labor Supply contribute to demand and to wage determination.
Economic migrants in turn respond to wages and other labor market conditions. Supply and demand
interact in the Wage, Price and Profit block. Prices and profits determine market shares. Output
depends on market shares and the components of demand.

Figure 1-1 REMI Policy Insight overview

The REMI model brings together all of the above elements to determine the value of each of the
variables in the model for each year in the baseline forecast. The model includes all the inter-industry
interactions that are included in input-output models in the Output block, but goes well beyond an
input-output model by including the linkages among all of the other blocks shown in Figure 1-1.
In order to broaden the model in this way, it was necessary to estimate key relationships. This was
accomplished by using extensive data sets covering all areas in the country. These large data sets and
two decades of research effort have enabled REMI to simultaneously maintain a theoretically sound
model structure and build a model based on all the relevant data available.
The model has strong dynamic properties, which means that it forecasts not only what will happen
but also when it will happen. This results in long-term predictions that have general equilibrium
properties. This means that the long-term properties of general equilibrium models are preserved
while maintaining accurate year-by-year predictions and estimating key equations using primary data
sources.
Figure 1-2 shows the policy simulation process for a scenario called Policy X. The effects of a
scenario are determined by comparing the baseline REMI forecast with an alternative forecast that
incorporates the assumptions for the scenario. The baseline REMI forecast uses recent data and
thousands of equations to generate projected economic activity for a particular region. The policy
variables in the model are set equal to their baseline value (typically zero for additive variables and

257



one for multiplicative variables) when solving for the baseline forecast. To show the effects of a
given scenario, these policy variables are given values that represent the direct effects of the scenario.
The alternative forecast is generated using these policy variable inputs. Figure 1-2 shows how this
process would work for a policy change called Policy X.

1-2 Assumptions
For this project, REMI examined the economic effects of oil and natural gas conservation policies in
the State of Connecticut. REMI made the following assumptions:
1. The conservation costs and benefits begin in 2005.
2. Increasing the surcharge for both oil and natural gas decreases consumer spending for other
consumer goods.
3. When efficiency increases, consumers and commercial and industrial firms require less oil and
natural gas.
4. Any drop in consumer spending on oil and natural gas is reallocated to increased spending on
other goods.
5. Decreasing costs for both commercial and industrial firms reduces production costs.
6. All output sold by oil and natural gas industries is considered intermediate goods.
7. The benefits of enacting the oil and natural gas policies are seen in the first year (no time lag).

1-3 Simulation Inputs
For simulation inputs please see Tables 1-1 and 1-2. The first two forecasts modeled oil and natural
gas as separate policies. The third forecast combined Tables 1-1 and 1-2 to model the economic
effects of both policies on Connecticut.

Consumer Spending
For both energy types, oil and natural gas, there was both a decrease and increase in consumer
spending. The increase in consumer spending is due to the surcharge on oil and natural gas. The
surcharge boosts the cost of a relatively inelastic good, which forces consumers to purchase less of
other goods to pay for the increase in energy prices. They save money, however, as a result of the
efficiency improvements they are able to implement due to the program. The decrease in consumer
spending is the benefit that residential users will receive from requiring less energy to fuel their
homes. Shown in ‘Consumer Spending’ Tables 1-1 and 1-2

Consumption Reallocation
Consumption reallocation transfers the money saved on energy to purchasing other goods. The input
is based on the assumption that all money saved from energy efficient improvements will be spent on
other goods. Shown in ‘Consumption Reallocation’ on Tables 1-1 and Tables 1-2.

Energy Costs
All of REMI’s forecasts indicate that energy costs increase for industrial and commercial users due to
the surcharge, but decrease due to more efficient energy usage. Oil and Natural Gas are modeled
similarly. In both forecasts fuel costs for firms rise due to the surcharge, but the firms also save
money as a results of the improvements they implement due to the program. Shown in ‘Oil Cost for
Commercial Firms’ and ‘Oil Cost for Industrial Firms’ in Table 1-1 for oil, and as shown in ‘NG cost
for Commercial Firms’ and ‘NG Cost for Industrial Firms’ in Table 1-2 for natural gas.

259



Intermediate Demand
Both the oil and natural gas industry sectors experience a loss in revenue due to the decrease in
demand spurred by conservation policies. This loss is entered into REMI Policy Insight as a loss of
intermediate demand for the particular industry. The intermediate demand variable in REMI Policy
Insight does take into account that local firms will not absorb 100% of the loss in demand. How
much demand loss is ‘transferred’ to firms outside the region depends on the Regional Purchase
Coefficient (RPC). Each industry in REMI Policy Insight has a specific RPC. The RPC is the ratio of
consumer goods bought from local firm versus non-local firms. Please note that the loss in
intermediate demand is much greater on the oil industry than on the natural gas industry. Shown in
‘Intermediate Demand’ on Tables 1-1 and 1-2.

Investment
REMI modeled significant investment in electrical equipment and other sectors through increased
industry demand. Since there are no estimated investment values, we approximate the investment in
different sectors using REMI Policy Insight forecast data. Doing so yields total output by industry,
which, when multiplied by the ratio of electricity to total output in the I-O table, gives an estimation
of the total annual spending on electricity. Dividing by the adjusted REMI baseline prices (as given
by the IPM run), we get an estimate of annual MWh consumption. Now we can multiply by the
surcharge of $3/MWh, which gives us an estimate of the total funds generated for investment in
energy efficiency. This investment is allocated to several different sectors using percentages
determined from 2001, 2002, and 2003 ECMB budget figures, as shown:
49% Electrical Equipment

(2907: Industry Sales (amount) Electrical Equipment),

13% Construction

(2923: Industry Sales (amount) Construction),

13% Professional Services

(2946: Industry Sales (amount) Miscellaneous Professional Services),

7%

Business Services

(2942: Industry Sales (amount) Miscellaneous Business Services)

6%

Government Spending (181: Government Spending (amount) State),

5%

Education

(2947: Industry Sales (amount) Education),

5%

Public Utilities

(1830: Capital Costs (amount) Public Utilities),

For the purpose of fitting the table into the report all investment was combined in ‘Investment
Spending’ on Tables 1-1 and 1-2. The investment categories were not combined in REMI Policy
Insight, but broken down by the above percentages.

2 Results & Analysis
As shown in Table 2-1, enacting conservation policies in Connecticut will stimulate positive growth
on the economy. All sectors of the economy will experience strong growth during the time frame,
with the exception of surprisingly small growth in Output. This effect occurs due to a loss in demand
and sales for the petroleum industry in Connecticut (see section 2-1). Connecticut does experience
strong growth in employment, largely in the service and retail sector, resulting from the decrease in
fuel costs and increase in Real Disposable Income (the increase in Real Disposable Income directly
affects the increase in consumption).

2-1 Output
The Output of an economy is the amount of production in dollars, including all intermediate goods
purchased as well as value-added (labor, capital, and fuel investments and profit). We can also think
of output as sales for both final goods and intermediate goods. Output is dependent upon
consumption in the area, state government spending, investment, and exports of the industries in the
region.
In both of these scenarios state government spending, investment, and industry sales remain
relatively equal between the two scenarios. The difference in output is based on the decrease in
consumption that results from higher costs for consumers.
When looking at Output growth in the oil and natural gas policy scenarios separately, we see that
the majority of growth results from the natural gas. Very little growth in output for Connecticut
occurs due to the oil policy. In fact, a loss of Output from the baseline occurs in 2014 and 2020. The
significant difference in Output growth is due to a loss in demand for oil (please refer to Table 1-1;
Intermediate Demand for Oil). By 2020, the oil industry will receive a total loss of demand of $2.221
billion, compared to the natural gas industry which will experience of loss in demand of $340 million.
The REMI simulation does take into account economic leakage, that is, the loss of demand does not
fully occur in the State of Connecticut.
In the first forecast (oil as a single policy) the petroleum-products industry receives a cumulative
loss of $451 million over the forecast period. In the second forecast (natural gas as a single policy)
the natural gas industry has a cumulative loss of $10.5 million over the forecast period. Again, this is
due the higher loss in intermediate demand for the oil industry.
The projected increase in output in 2005 is $107.1 million when looking at the oil and natural gas
policies combined. By 2020 the Output growth of both policies is $262 million dollars with a
cumulative total of $3.1 billion.

2-2 Gross State Product
Gross State Product (GSP) as a value added concept is analogous to the national concept of Gross
Domestic Product. It is equal to Output, excluding intermediate inputs. The value-add concept is
equal to compensation and profits.
Similar to Output, GSP growth in the oil-policy scenario is significantly lower than natural gas.
However, in the oil-policy scenario, GSP does not experience any of the loss that Output does due to
the definition of GSP. The Output of an economy is the sales of all goods, including intermediate
and final goods. GSP does not include sales of intermediate goods, and all demand loss for oil by
firms is intermediate. As seen in Figure 2-3, in the natural-gas-policy scenario GSP increases
dramatically over the 15-year time horizon, while there is only a slight increase in GSP in the oilpolicy scenario.
The projected increase in GSP in 2005 is $64.96 million. By 2020 the annual increase for GSP is
$170.90 million with a cumulative increase of $2,040.80 million.

2-3 Employment
The Employment variable in REMI Policy Insight uses historical data from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) and is based upon place of work, including part-time and full-time employees. The
employment figures projected below are the difference from baseline and should not be cumulated.
As expected, the increase in employment is largely due to the natural gas policy. However, there is
also an employment increase due to the oil policy, roughly 33% of the total in 2005 and 20% of the
total employment increase in 2020. The employment increase in both scenarios is due largely to
increases in consumption (an increase in consumption is the result of an increase in consumer
spending). Consequently, roughly 66% percent (1,650 jobs) of new employment is in the retail trade
and service sectors in 2020. The two industries that suffer a loss in employment are the petroleum
products industry (16 workers by 2020) and the natural gas industry (4 workers by 2020). Fortunately
the employment losses are so small that they can be considered negligible. There is also some indirect
job loss in the oil-policy scenario due to oil firms purchasing slightly less capital from the decrease in
demand. Again, the employment loss is relatively small, only 10 jobs in 2020, and the loss is made up
in the employment gains from consumption.
The initial total employment increase in 2005 is 1,073 net new workers. The initial growth rate is
high, roughly 34%, but slows considerably over the next 14 years, to 1% in 2020. The decreasing
growth rate flattens the growth in employment as the economy adjusts. By 2020 the total net new
employment is 2,478 new workers.

2-4 Population
Population is a key variable in REMI Policy Insight that affects the potential labor force, government
spending, consumption spending, and housing prices. The changes in population are due to changes
in migration, the result of either economic growth or loss.
All changes in population are cumulative. Each year is difference from baseline, but includes the
previous year. The large increase in population is due to the natural gas investment. In 2005 the
population of the State of Connecticut increases by 161 people with a linear increase cumulating to
3,617 net new people in Connecticut in 2020. The in migration is due largely to economic migration
and the family members of the economic migrants.

2-5 Real Disposable Income
Real Disposable Income is the inflation-adjusted income that is available for consumers to spend. It
is personal income minus taxes and social contributions plus dividends, rents, and transfer payments.
The numbers of employees in the area, their wage rate, and the consumer prices all affect real
Disposable Income. An increase in employment or wage, or a decrease in consumers’ prices increases
a region’s Real Disposable Income. Consequently, the opposite decreases Real Disposable Income.
The increase in Real Disposable Income is an indirect effect from the new jobs in Connecticut.
The summation of new wages, minus taxes, earned by workers equals the increase in Real Disposable
Income. Although there was a decrease in the amount of spending on natural gas and oil, there was
no direct effect on Real Disposable Income as it was assumed any decrease in spending on natural
gas and oil would be spent on other goods.
The projected increase in Real Disposable Income is $29.17 million in 2005. By 2020, Real
Disposable Income increases to $153.20 million for a cumulative increase of $1753.36 million.

2-6 State Revenue
State Revenue represents the gains or losses in income for the State of Connecticut from tax
revenues. These revenues include individual income tax, general sales tax, tobacco sales tax, and
property tax. All changes in state revenue are indirect effects only. It does not take into account the
changes in tax income from the oil and natural gas industry. All effects are the results of a change in
economic activity. Real Disposable Income and Population affect State Revenues directly.
As seen in section 2-5 the large increase in Real Disposable Income is the due to the natural gas
policy. As Population and Real Disposable Income increases, so do the State Revenues that
Connecticut collects. Beginning in 2005 the State of Connecticut will collect $8.37 million additional
revenue due to the conservation policies. In 2020, the State of Connecticut will collect $31.62 million
cumulating to a total of $381.66 million collected over the 15 year time period.

Appendix: Economic Impact of Health Benefits using COBRA
Using additional data provided by EPA, REMI ran two additional forecast scenarios modeling the
economic effect of the increase in health benefits due to the conservation programs. The health
benefits result from the indirect effects of the conservation policies on reducing air pollution. To
estimate the overall economic impact of the reduction in air pollution, REMI used outputs from
EPA’s Co-benefits Risk Assessment (COBRA) model. COBRA provides a monetary value of the
changes in health benefits due to changes in air pollution.

COBRA
The COBRA model calculates the monetary impact of changes in air pollution via a three-step
process. First, the model uses an air-quality model to quantify the associated change in air particles.
Second, COBRA uses concentration response (C-R) functions that link changes in particles to health
incidences, such as a decrease in respiratory illnesses due to less harmful particulate matter in the air.
Finally, COBRA estimates the monetary impact of each health incidence based on direct medical
costs, value of statistical life, willingness-to-pay, and cost-of-illness values. The final outputs of the
COBRA model used by REMI Policy Insight are: mortality changes, health incidence improvements
such as decreases in respiratory illnesses, fewer missed work days, and the value of all health
incidences on the medical and insurance industries.
The output of the COBRA model is provided statically in two separate years, 2010 and 2020.
REMI linearly interpolated the output to format into REMI Policy Insight.

Methodology
REMI modeled two alternative forecasts using the outputs from the COBRA model. The first
forecast modeled the economic effects of the mortality changes, fewer missed workdays (modeled as
an increase in labor productivity), and the loss in revenue on the medical and insurance industries.
The second forecast modeled the same economic effects, but also included the increased value
individuals place upon Connecticut due to higher air quality. To model the value individuals place on
an increase in air quality, REMI uses the economic concept of compensating differential.
Compensating differential within REMI Policy Insight accounts for the regional differences in the
net economic migration between regions. The model calculates that regions with higher economic
migration have a higher quality of life. A high economic migration increases the labor force of an
area, reducing the wage rate. The consequent assumption is regions with a high quality-of-life have
can pay lower wage rates to keep or attract new employees. Inversely, regions with a low quality-oflife compensate employees with higher wages. As the air quality in Connecticut increases, the qualityof-life in Connecticut increases, individuals will migrate into the region, the labor force will increase,
and employees require less compensation.

272



Model Inputs
Mortality Change
To simulate the mortality change, the number of deaths decreased from the COBRA model was
used to change the survival rate in the simulation. The 2010 and 2020 COBRA snapshots provided
two points of the actual numbers of deaths avoided if the policy was implemented. The years
between 2005-2009 and 2009-2020 were interpolated linearly from those two points.

Labor Productivity
COBRA calculates the decrease in days off taken by workers due to illness. Based on the data
provided, REMI assumed that gains in workdays would increase productivity. REMI increased
productivity proportionally to the increase in hours worked over total hours worked in Connecticut.

Medical and Insurance Impacts
The final values the COBRA model provided were the loss of business activity for the medical and
insurance industries. Due to healthier Connecticut residents from the policy impact, there would be a
decrease in demand in the Connecticut medical and health insurance sectors. The value used was the
same as the total dollar value of the health improvements. The assumption used to estimate loss in
revenue due to fewer health incidences put 50% of loss in the medical industry and 50% in the
insurance industry. The policy variables used in Policy Insight were decreases in demand for both
these industries.

Health Incidence Improvements
The total dollar value of the health improvements from the COBRA model was used to change
the compensating differential within the simulation. The lowered compensating differential decreases
the wage amount needed to keep or attract new employees into the region due to better air quality.

273



Results
Table 4 summarizes the economic growth in the State of Connecticut due to the increase in the
health benefits resulting from the oil and natural gas conservation policies. This table shows the
cumulative growth of Connecticut over the 15-year time period for three alternative forecasts. The
first forecast simulates the economic impact of the health benefits without using REMI Policy
Insight’s Compensating Differential Variable (See Inputs). The second forecast simulates the
economic impact of the health benefits using REMI Policy Insight’s Compensating Differential
variable. The final forecast included all inputs of the oil and natural gas policies and the inputs
calculated from COBRA.

Using EPA’s COBRA model, REMI was able to model the economic impacts of the increase in air
quality in Connecticut due to the energy conservation projects. The results of the REMI model show
a small negative effect upon the economy. The negative effect is due to the loss in revenue for the
medical and insurance industry. Even though Connecticut benefits economically from an increase in
labor productivity and the compensating differential, the benefits do not outweigh the loss in revenue
for the medical and insurance industry2.
In the first forecast shows a decrease in 15 jobs in the economy, a loss of $22.57 million in Output
and $12.36 million in GSP by 2020. Real Disposable Income decreases by $5.75 million and the State
of Connecticut losses $1.26 million in State Revenue. The only positive increase in the first forecast is
Population by 2 people.
The inclusion of the compensating differential variable in the second forecast slightly dampens the
negative impacts. The second forecast shows a loss in employment of 9 jobs, a loss of $11 million in
Output and $3.98 million in GSP. By using the compensating differential variable there are slightly
positive impacts for Population, Real Disposable Income, and State Revenues. As stated in the inputs
section, compensating differential increases the attractiveness of Connecticut. As Connecticut
becomes more attractive, migration into the area increases. The influx of people into the state

increases the total amount Real Disposable Income. State Revenue is dependent on the amount of
Real Disposable Income, and therefore increases as well. Population increases by 41 people,
increasing the amount of Real Disposable Incomes by $3.3 million and the amount of revenue
collected by the State of Connecticut by $810 thousand.
The final forecast combines the COBRA simulations with the final oil and natural gas simulation.
It is important to note that the negative impact due to the loss in revenue in the medical and
insurance industry is relatively small when weighed against the positive impact of enacting the oil and
natural gas conservation policies. The total economic impact the oil and natural gas policies have on
the State of Connecticut is positive. The benefits of the policies would increase employment roughly
by 1,670 jobs by 2020. Output would increase by $3.094 billion and Gross State Product would
increase by $2.03 billion by 2020. Population would increase by 1,724 people, Real Disposable
Income would increase by $1.758 billion dollars and State Revenues collected by Connecticut would
increase by $382 million dollars.
Table 4 and Table 5 show the annual economic effects for two specific years: 2010 and 2020.
These graphs are not an accumulation of preceding years, but instead show the economic effects on
Connecticut is for the specific year. As with the accumulated totals of each forecast shown in Table
4, the increase in health benefits will have a negative impact on Connecticut.

GSC Response
DEP 2005 legislative proposal to
reduce the sulfur content in home
heating oil from 3000 ppm to 500 ppm
starting in 2007. This is >75% reduction
in SO2. Furnaces will run much cleaner
as a result.
The oil and gas conservation funds
would also provide incentives for
installation and use of cleaner, more
efficient technology.
This item is being coordinated through
the ECMB, of which the DEP is a
member. The DPUC will take these
comments into consideration as it
determines the manner in which it will
implement this action item.
This item is also being coordinated
through the ECMB.
See “Suggested Next Steps for
Implementation” section of each
recommendation – short­term goals
incorporated where possible
The Plan's recommendations are
designed to increase investment and
reverse this trend.
DEP is required to amend its
regulations in order to keep them
consistent with CA. These amendments
must be completed by the end of 2005
in order to be in effect for the 2009
model year.

Brief Summary of Comments
State should implement a feebate
program. Suggest an approach that
ties financial incentives into current
sales tax structure.

Acknowledges state efforts to perform
congestion pricing study and pilot
program. VMT increases are a major
concern.
Clean diesel and black carbon efforts
currently by the DEP, DOT and City of
New Haven are acknowledged as
positive first steps. Stress need to build
onto these programs

Create self­sustaining revenue neutral

Bridgeport is preparing a "green plan"
which will include some of the goals in
the action plan.
Increase waste to energy capacity in
CT– would reduce GHG from
transporting waste to out of state
landfills. Recommend to Governor that
DEP “moratorium” on additional WTE
capacity be lifted and that CRRA be
charged with study and development of
the most cost­effective means of
increasing capacity.
“I am grateful and delighted that
Connecticut is addressing climate
change and ways to ameliorate it. I
fully support this initiative... It’s about
time we as a state stepped up our
efforts.”

278

GSC Response
CT is working with MA, RI and ME to
assess the environmental and
economic benefits and impacts of a
regional approach. Initial technical
analysis is expected to be completed in
January 2005. Based on that, we will
work with stakeholders in CT to
determine the best implementation
approach.
Thank you. The Plan's
recommendations for both smart growth
and transit expansion should slow down
VMT growth.
The DEP’s diesel initiative is a
comprehensive statewide plan that will
be part of our efforts to attain the fine
particulate standard. Reductions are
expected from both mobile and
stationary source sectors.
We recognize that the State C&D plan
does not include implementation
requirements for most entities. We
anticipate that legislation will be
introduced to broaden the range of
entities that will be required to
implement smart growth initiatives.
DEP will address recycling
implementation issues in Solid Waste
Mgmt Plan (DEP has issued RFP to
develop plan)
Will forward recommendation to
Department of Agriculture and work
more closely with them on land
preservation strategies
We would be interested in hearing more
about how this idea would work. A
“white paper” or equivalent would be
welcomed. Then, we can determine the
best implementation mechanisms.
Great!

DEP will address disposal capacity
issues in Solid Waste Mgmt Plan (DEP
has issued RFP to develop plan).
There is no current “moratorium” on
WTE capacity in CT. CGS Section 22a­
208d requires a written determination of
need from DEP that the facility is
necessary to meet the solid waste
disposal needs of the state.
Thanks for the support!

recommendation

The CCEF has funded, or committed
funding, nearly all of its prior budgetary
appropriations for solar PV programs.
A proposal from CCEF staff to the
board will request additional funding to
support the continued efforts of the
program.
Additional analyses will need to be
conducted following a multi­year
evaluation of the current RPS through
2010.
These issues are currently integral to
the work of the regional greenhouse
gas initiative (RGGI). Once the RGGI
model rule is completed in April 2005,
each state will undertake its own
rulemaking processes. We will consider
these comments again at that time.
Same response as for above comment.

DEP will address in Solid Waste Mgmt
Plan (DEP has issued RFP to develop
plan).
The current funding level for the
systems benefits charge is set by state
statute­ any funding increase will
require a legislative change. The DPUC
will take these comments into
consideration to the extent such an
increase is proposed.
The development of both conservation
funds will likely require legislative
action. To date, various funding levels
have been contemplated and the
benefits of a suggested funding level for
both funds was examined in the studies
which the GSC recently performed.
Thank you for your support of the DEP
clean diesel initiative. We will work with
stakeholders on ways to increase
penetration and effectiveness and
would welcome any further details on
this proposal.
The Plan's recommendations would
fund improved services for bus and rail.

The VMT management strategies
included in the Plan, and all the
calculation of emissions reductions,
was premised on such an investment in
and expansion of transit.

We recognize that the State C&D plan
does not include implementation
requirements for most entities. We
anticipate that legislation will be
introduced to broaden the range of
entities that will be required to
implement smart growth initiatives.
Since much of the funding for service
and system expansions will come from
US DOT, these policies should be
integrated into the planning and design
processes.

findings:
mid­level scenario:
Results in a decline in
revenue for public utilities
of 17.7% (in 2005) of
electricity demand. This
leads to a small decline in
economic growth from
2005­2008, but produces a
positive change in
economic growth from
2009 forward.
optimistic scenario:
Public utilities sector
suffers no loss of revenue.
Benefits due to energy
savings quickly outweigh
costs and there is greater
economic growth from
2006 forward.
conservative scenario:
public utilities loss of
revenue equal to 35.5% of
the decline in electricity
demand. CT experiences
less economic growth
through 2013, but
experiences stronger
economic growth from
2014 forward



APPENDIX 12
Response to Questions Regarding the Draft Climate Change Action Plan
as Presented to a Joint Conference of the Environment, Energy,
Commerce and Transportation Committees
Submitted by DEP Commissioner Gina McCarthy
January 28, 2005
Introduction
This document has been prepared to respond to questions of individual
legislators at the joint hearing of January 19, many of which reflected the
questions raised by the Office of Legislative Research in their review of the draft
Connecticut Climate Change Action Plan. The legislative questions, as well as
those of the Office of Legislative Research (OLR), included both broad thematic
and more narrowly focused questions, which informed the form of this response.
Thematically, the responses address costs and action prioritization, public
participation and process and regional partnering.
We want to acknowledge and recognize the substantial legislative commitment
to develop an aggressive implementation plan. The leadership is to be
commended for the actions taken thus far. We look forward to continuing to
work collaboratively with the legislature to address this important issue.
Costs and Action Prioritization
Connecticut’s draft 2005 action plan is just that, a planning document, a road
map for us to follow as we move forward. We fully recognize that this is the first
step of a long process. Therefore, it is premature and may be misleading to total
all projected costs or benefits. Rather, we have provided the attached charts
which identify as available estimated costs for full implementation of each item.
The charts are separated into those 38 items, which have been given priority,
and the subsequent 17, which require both additional review and action toward
implementation.
Also provided in the charts:
·
·

·
·

information on the state agency lead for each action item;
a prioritized list of the action items, including our anticipated
implementation mechanism [i.e. use existing authority, adopt regulatory
amendment, new legislation expected to be needed];
anticipated greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions in 2010 and 2020;
the cost per ton of reductions for those action items where relevant and
independent data were available;

289



for selected action items, where completed, we have also provided
information on additional economic and public health benefits.
Climate change is an issue that touches upon all economic and environmental
sectors. We have also not yet begun to address the significant costs of not
taking action, or further delaying so, and the costs needed to adapt to climate
change. The cost of inaction is already high and increasing each year. We know
that increased storm frequency and severity is now costing insurance companies
about $40 billion last year, and rising. We also see increases in tropical insects
and the need to address them, e.g. the DEP efforts to address the West Nile
virus in Connecticut. We must devote resources to solve this effort over the long
term. We are completely open to, and have thoughts on, how to develop funding
streams that have minimal immediate impacts on the state budget.
·

The full action plan, available at www.ctclimatechange.com, provides citations
for referenced technical work. Experience with costs in other environmental
programs is also relevant here. For many of the major programs adopted
pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, costs have often been inflated. Taking lead
out of gasoline was accomplished at a tenth of the costs estimated by
manufacturers. The acid rain program was implemented at an average cost of
$170­200 per ton of sulfur dioxide, again, about a tenth of that estimated by the
utility industry. We will continue to work diligently to develop costs and benefits
for those items that currently do not have associated values. Also, as additional
information is obtained, such as through the stakeholder process we envision,
we will review those data and incorporate revisions, as appropriate, into the
action plan.
From the beginning, the state has approached this as an economic development
opportunity. Tap into and further develop Connecticut’s excellent brainpower to
commercialize and invent the technologies and processes that will lead the way.
Connecticut is known as “cellicon” valley within the fuel cell industry due to the
large concentration of manufacturers here. We want to encourage their growth
as these are high paying manufacturing jobs. The University of Connecticut has
established a Fuel Cell Research Center. The government of the United Kingdom
has visited several Connecticut fuel cell manufacturers to assess the ability of
technology developed here to help the UK reduce their GHG footprint. Our
energy efficiency program, administered through the Energy Conservation
Management Board (ECMB), received national recognition in 2004 for its high
cost­effectiveness, its broad focus and its ability to help transform markets.
These are just a few of the many positive economic development opportunities
that can be achieved through the implementation of items in the state’s climate
change action plan.

Public Participation and Process
Providing a robust public comment and input structure was important to the
development of this plan. As this item was also raised by the OLR report,
attached are all public comments received during the open comment period. We
plan to establish and complete a stakeholder process this year to enable broad
public input. This will help build upon the work already completed, help develop
additional recommendations, and allow more technical assessments of the co­
benefits to be completed. We will especially reach out to the public health
community and the General Assembly. Representatives from public health can
help assist us to further analyze the co­benefits. Ongoing coordination with
representatives from the General Assembly will help assure adoption of
appropriate implementation mechanisms and identification of other means to
achieve the anticipated levels of reductions and their co­benefits.
During this year, we will also be engaged in implementing the 38 actions already
accepted for immediate action. In particular, we will focus on:
·
·
·
·

·

amending regulations to adopt the Pavley portion of our clean car
standards;
investigating opportunities to increase the use of bio­diesel in
Connecticut;
continue to work with other state agencies and stakeholders on mercury
reductions, to help achieve co­benefits associated with this plan
complete the request for proposal process that will help the state amend
its solid waste plan to increase the recycling rate and address source
reduction; and
work with the legislature to craft language that will help establish oil and
gas conservation funds, in a manner that is responsive to state goals and
helps provide significant GHG reductions. More efficient consumption also
directly benefits consumers through lower energy bills.

Each of these efforts includes its own stakeholder and public process.
Regional Partnering
Connecticut’s actions [and those of our sister New England states] reflect the
long record of state innovation leading the way. In clean air, New England
established an association to collaborate on air policy in 1967, three years before
that of EPA. We took action to address acid rain many years before EPA and
Congress recognized its importance. We reduced power plant emissions through
an innovative market based program that is now being emulated elsewhere in
the country and the world. In the area of greenhouse gases, we are working
with New England and mid­Atlantic states to develop processes for inventorying,
registering and potentially establishing a cap and trade program. We continue to
work with sister states in the region and use the New England Governor’s Council

291



Power Planning Committee to coordinate on renewable portfolio standards.
States have long been laboratories of innovation, providing replicable examples
of how best to implement ideas. Our efforts to address climate change are
consistent with our 38­year collaborative relationship with other New England
and Northeastern states.
Consistent with this collaborative history, we will continue to search for and
implement actions on a regional scale, within the context of this action plan. Our
air shed, our transportation and electric grid infrastructures and our economies
are regionally linked. All six New England states and the five eastern Canadian
provinces have now completed climate change action plans. We will work
through existing planning structures to assure cross­fertilization to maximize our
benefits, improve market penetration and adopt measures that develop our
economy. Many of the items in Connecticut’s plan will also help us to achieve
our ozone and fine particulate air quality objectives, as part of those mandated
under the federal Clean Air Act. We have worked for the past four years within
ISO­NE to promote distributed generation to improve grid reliability. This work
will reduce reliance on older, less efficient power plants, reduce electricity costs
[this will help to reduce the congestion charge “adder” to southwest Connecticut
ratepayers, which is currently in the range of $100­300 million annually] and also
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The legislative passage during 2004 of stricter
appliance standards now helps us to encourage other states to do the same,
therefore increasing market penetration for more efficient appliances, reducing
consumer energy costs, air pollution and greenhouse gases. Passage of the
California Low Emissions Vehicle standards during 2004 and our expected
adoption of the Pavley amendments during 2005 will significantly reduce
exposure to air toxics and reduce concentration of pre­cursors to ozone
formation. Other states are also adopting these same standards, including
Massachusetts, Maine and New York. Each of the 55 action items so far
recommended via the stakeholder process can be viewed with such a lens. The
plan itself therefore helps to harmonize planning throughout the state in order to
achieve multiple objectives.
Conclusion
We appreciate this opportunity to provide information to the legislature on this
critically important issue. We hope the information helps not only to better focus
on the key deliberative issues, but also to enable actions to occur in a
collaborative and systematic manner. The economic opportunities to gain
competitive advantage exist; the costs of doing nothing further increase each
year. Working with the cognizant committees in the legislature will help us
implement this plan collaboratively and efficiently. Additional stakeholder input
will improve the plan and frame the issues to be included in the annual report we
submit at the end of this year. We look forward to working with you and we
greatly appreciate your support.

ENERGY & TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE SUPPORT FOR
CONNECTICUT CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION PLAN 2005
The Governor’s Steering Committee, pursuant to Public Act 04­252 [Sec. 2 (b)],
submitted a draft climate change action plan on January 5, 2005 to the joint standing
committees of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to the
environment, energy, transportation, and commerce.
On January 19, 2005, Commissioners McCarthy (DEP) and Downes (DPUC) presented
the draft climate change action plan to the joint standing committees. A discussion of the
draft climate change action plan ensued.
Public comment was taken on the draft climate change action plan through a public
meeting held by the Environment Committee on January 28, 2005.
The joint standing committees voted to support the plans according to the following
meeting minutes:
Transportation Committee – Monday, January 31, 2005 at 10:00 a.m.
Rep. Guerrera asked for a motion to endorse the Draft CT Climate Change Action Plan
concept, recognizing that it is a long­range planning document designed to achieve
statutory green­house gas reductions, over decades. And further recognizing that the
implementation of many of the specific reduction strategies outlined in the draft plan will
require future legislative or regulatory enactment, including additional opportunities for
further public input and participation. Sen. McDonald, seconded by Rep. Scribner, made
the motion. A voice vote was taken and the motion passed.
