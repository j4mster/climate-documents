Executive Summary
There is broad scientific consensus that human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are
impacting the earth’s climate, and that increasing atmospheric GHG concentrations will result in
very significant adverse global, regional, and local environmental impacts. 1 The Northeastern
United States is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with potentially
devastating ecological, economic and public health impacts to New Jersey. 2 Not only does
climate change threaten New Jersey’s shoreline and ecology, but the socioeconomic impacts of
climate change stand to be profound and costly.
Recognizing this immediate need, New Jersey enacted the Global Warming Response Act
(GWRA) (P.L. 2007, c.112) on July 6, 2007. The GWRA calls for a reduction in GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, approximately a 20 percent reduction below estimated 2020
business-as-usual emissions, followed by a further reduction of emissions to 80 percent below
2006 levels by 2050. As required under the Act, this report specifically provides the Governor,
Treasurer and the State Legislature with recommendations for achieving the 2020 statewide
GHG limit. The report also recognizes the contributions that a set of other public policies, not
developed primarily to address climate change, will have on reducing statewide GHG emissions.
A draft of this report was issued for stakeholder comment in December 2008. All of the climatespecific recommendations and related actions in this final report take into consideration the
numerous comments received by the State during its stakeholder period. As demonstrated
throughout the report, meeting the State’s ambitious GHG limits will require not only long-term
measures, but also immediate actions that will both stabilize GHG emissions in the short-term
and create a foundation for the carbon-neutral future required to meet the 2050 limit. Attaining
the State’s 2050 limit (approximately 26 MMT CO2eq) will also provide ancillary benefits of
transforming the New Jersey economy to one that drives creation of “green” jobs by making
clean energy and technologies a cornerstone of the State’s economy.
As highlighted by the scope and nature of the recommendations and related actions included in
this report, global climate change affects all aspects of our lives, and the scope of measures
needed to meet New Jersey’s GHG limits is extensive. Therefore, this report includes an array of
recommendations and related actions, including legislative, regulatory and market-based
measures, which provide a balance that will allow New Jersey to meet its statewide GHG limits
without unduly burdening any one particular sector or industry. This report provides a
comprehensive technical and financial framework for decision making on a range of specific
actions that can be taken to reduce GHG emissions in New Jersey.
New Jersey Statewide Greenhouse Gas Inventory
Released on October 31, 2008, the State’s first GHG inventory and forecasts 3 presents a
preliminary assessment of New Jersey’s statewide anthropogenic GHG emissions (including
CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain halogenated gases) and sinks (carbon

contributing to New Jersey’s overall GHG emissions profile.

New Jersey statewide GHG emissions in 1990 were approximately 123 million metric tons
(MMT) of CO2 equivalent per year. By 2004 4 , those emissions had risen 11 percent to
approximately 137 MMT. Under a business-as-usual scenario, emissions are projected to
increase 25 percent over 1990 levels to approximately 154 MMT per year by 2020.
Ensuring Attainment of the Statewide 2020 Greenhouse Gas Limit
Three core measures form the backbone of New Jersey’s plan to meet its statewide 2020 GHG
limit. The core measures implement the:
•
•
•

New Jersey Energy Master Plan (EMP);
New Jersey Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program; and,
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program.

The core measures are targeted at reducing GHG emissions from the two largest contributors to
New Jersey GHG emissions – transportation and energy – and they lay the groundwork for all
future actions in these areas.
4

The State has completed GHG inventory estimates for 2005, 2006 and 2007. Data show that differences
from the 2004 to 2007 totals are minor; the sectoral proportions are similar.
7



Energy Master Plan. After an intensive public participation process, the New Jersey Board of
Public Utilities (NJBPU) released the State’s EMP 5 on October 22, 2008. The EMP provides the
State with a road map for reaching a responsible energy future with adequate, reliable energy and
heating supplies that are both environmentally responsible and competitively priced. The EMP
establishes the following five goals:
•
•
•
•
•

Maximize energy conservation and energy efficiency to achieve reductions in statewide
energy consumption of at least 20 percent by 2020;
Reduce peak electricity demand for electricity by 5,700 MW by 2020;
Strive to exceed the current renewable portfolio standard of 22.5 percent by 2020, and meet
30 percent of the State’s electricity needs from renewable sources by 2020;
Develop a 21st century energy infrastructure that supports the goals and action items of the
Energy Master Plan, ensures reliability of the system, and makes available additional tools to
consumers to manage their energy consumption; and,
Invest in innovative clean energy technologies and businesses to stimulate the industry’s
growth in New Jersey.

Low Emission Vehicle Program: On November 28, 2005, New Jersey adopted a Low Emission
Vehicle (LEV) program modeled after California’s LEV Program. 6 The program contains three
components: vehicle emission standards, fleet-wide emission requirements and a Zero Emission
Vehicle (ZEV) sales requirement. New Jersey’s adoption of its LEV program ensures that
vehicles designed to incrementally produce fewer and fewer GHG emissions over time will be
available for purchase in New Jersey.
On September 28, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of
Transportation jointly proposed federal motor vehicle GHG emission standards and related fuel
economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016. 7 Once adopted, this federal motor
vehicle control program could impact the GHG emission reductions projected for the New Jersey
LEV program.
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative: New Jersey is one of ten states participating in the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a ten-state mandatory CO2 cap-and-trade program
to reduce CO2 emissions from the electric power sector. The RGGI program caps regional
power plant CO2 emissions from 2009 through 2014 and then reduces those emissions 10 percent
by 2018. RGGI's phased approach means that reductions in the CO2 cap will initially be modest,
providing predictable market signals and regulatory certainty. Electricity generators will be able
to plan for and invest in lower-carbon alternatives and avoid dramatic electricity price impacts.
Under the RGGI program, regulated power plants must hold an emission permit, or allowance,
for every ton of CO2 they emit. Allowances are sold quarterly at auction; states will use the
proceeds of allowance auctions to support low-carbon-intensity solutions, including energy
efficiency and clean renewable energy, such as solar and wind power.
According to an analysis conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
(NJDEP) (included as Appendix 1 of this report) the three core measures, if fully successful and

fully implemented on schedule, would result in a reduction of approximately 38 MMT CO2eq
below the estimated business-as-usual emission level of 154 MMT CO2eq, or 116 MMT CO2eq,
by 2020. This would allow the State to meet its statewide 2020 limit of 123 MMT CO2eq.
Figure ES 2 shows the impact of failing to implement these core recommendations, instead
allowing for a business-as-usual scenario for the State. Economic impact analyses conducted by
the Rutgers University Center for Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy (CEEEP), found
that the implementation of the EMP (including RGGI) would have a negligible impact on the
State’s economy and that the implementation of the LEV program would add minimally to that
impact (see Chapter 2 and Appendix 2 for further information).

All emission and reduction quantities are estimates. The actual statewide emissions up to and including
2004 are unlikely to be more than 5 percent higher or lower than these estimates. The projections to 2020,
and the proposed reductions, are considerably less certain. Reductions attributable to RGGI are difficult to
quantify at a statewide level because the RGGI limits are regional. For purposes of the 2020 estimates that
reflect the various reductions, the emissions from New Jersey facilities covered by RGGI are considered to
be equal to New Jersey's estimated share of the total RGGI limit. All numbers are subject to revision by the
NJDEP as better information becomes available.

Actions Now for Future Impact
While meeting the State’s 2020 GHG limit is an essential first step for New Jersey,
implementing additional measures in the near-term will ensure that the State stays on track to
meet its 2050 limit. In addition to the three core recommendations, this report identifies a set of

22 supporting recommendations (see Table ES-1) to ensure attainment of the 2020 statewide
limit. Additionally, this report acknowledges the GHG emission reductions anticipated as a
result of several other significant statewide public policies.
Successful implementation of these recommendations will require the participation, collaboration
and cooperation of a broad spectrum of State agencies, businesses, organizations, public
officials, and New Jersey citizens. Therefore, outreach and education will be a crucial
component of the State’s efforts, as discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 of this report.

The State engaged the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) and Rutgers University Center for
Energy, Economic & Environmental Policy (CEEEP) to assess the GHG emissions reduction
potential and economic impacts of the supporting recommendations and related actions discussed
in this report. These analyses focused on a subset of the supporting recommendations and
related actions that were sufficiently well-developed to be quantifiable.
With respect to emission reduction potential, the supporting recommendations and related
actions quantified as part of these analyses would result in an estimated 26 MMTCO2eq of
reductions beyond the 38 MMTCO2eq of GHG emission reductions expected for 2020 from
implementation of the three core measures, resulting in a total of 64 MMTCO2eq of GHG
emission reductions in 2020. The largest additional GHG emissions reduction potential lies in
the transportation sector, followed by the waste management and building sectors. With the
amount of reduction needed by 2020 defined as the difference between the Business-as-Usual
projection of 154 MMTCO2eq for 2020 and the 2020 limit of 123 MMTCO2eq, or 31
MMTCO2eq, these analyses show that the supporting recommendations and related actions
provide an important start towards achievement of the 2050 limit.
With respect to economic impacts, the core and supporting recommendations and related actions
taken as a whole are projected to result in a slight gain in total employment and slight decreases
in personal income and Gross State Product (GSP) in 2020. The decreases in personal income
and GSP result from the fact that the analysis assumes higher prices for zero-emission and lowemission vehicles and energy efficient homes; those assumptions are projected to lead to lower
new vehicle registrations and residential building permits and consequently lower retail sales. It
should be noted that these results do not reflect environmental co-benefits such as preservation of
natural capital or reduction of SO2 and NOx costs.
For several reasons, the projections used in these economic analyses are probably on the
conservative side. First, the costs of the measures analyzed tend to be incurred as up-front
investments, while the resulting benefits accrue over a period of years. For example, planting
trees to sequester carbon or putting infrastructure in place to reduce VMT are actions that have
high initial costs, but will incrementally reduce the impacts of GHG emissions, preventing even
more expense in the future. Therefore, delays that would increase impacts to forests such as
forest loss or damage or property loss from flooding result in even greater costs to respond to
these losses in the future. Second, since the analysis uses a 2020 time horizon, benefits
occurring in later years are not counted. Third, while costs can usually be estimated in monetary
terms, some benefits such as quality of life and species preservation are difficult or impossible to

quantify and hence cannot be included in an analysis of this type, including some environmental
benefits.
To reach the 2020 GHG limit, the State will need to undertake a suite of policy measures, some
of which are more cost-effective than others. The State is pursuing what are expected to be the
most cost-effective measures first, namely the three core recommendations. The macroeconomic
impacts of the core measures are negligible. The supporting recommendations and related
actions are somewhat more expensive; but even with these more expensive measures, the overall
net economic impact of the full suite of policy measures would still be negligible. Considering
the major stakes New Jersey has in mitigation of climate change, the projected economic effects
can be seen as a cost-effective insurance policy and as an investment in maintaining New
Jersey’s economic vitality and quality of life.
Adaptation
Despite our best efforts to mitigate climate change in New Jersey, we must recognize that
emission reductions alone are not a sufficient policy response to climate change. Once emitted,
CO2 and other GHGs reside in the atmosphere for decades or centuries. 10 Even if all GHG
emissions were stopped immediately, there would still be a time lag between mitigation of
emissions and cessation of warming. Because of New Jersey’s uniquely diverse terrain, nearly
all the impacts of climate change, from rising temperatures in our urban areas to sea level rise
jeopardizing our coastal ecosystems to threats to our unique agricultural industries, will be
experienced throughout the State. Each of these impacts threatens the public health of New
Jersey residents, as well as the ecology and economy of State.
This report recommends that the State develop adaptation strategies to minimize climate-related
risks to public health, the environment and the economy. The report recommends that experts
from academia, government, non-governmental organizations, and the business community
develope policy recommendations on the most pressing adaptation policies New Jersey should
adopt to significantly reduce the State's risks from climate change impacts. By bringing together
various constituencies to develop a statewide climate change adaptation plan, New Jersey can be
proactive in fostering adaptive capacity in the built and natural environment and public health
infrastructure statewide to respond to climate change.
Beyond the 2020 Recommendations: Setting the Stage for 2050 and Implementation in the
Coming Months
While achieving the 2020 statewide GHG limit requires a firm commitment across the public and
private sectors, there is confidence and certainty that the means to do so are clear and achievable.
The essential steps are prompt action and an on-going dedication to results. However, the 2020
limit is an interim milestone intended to stabilize emissions. The 2050 limit – to reduce
emissions to a level 80 percent below 2006 emission levels represents the emission level
scientists advise is needed to avoid the most catastrophic potential effects from climate change. 11

11
It is understood that New Jersey’s independent achievement of the 2050 limit will not preclude local
climate change impacts; New Jersey recognizes its obligation to be part of the necessary global
response if the most catastrophic impacts are to be avoided.
12



While this report provides a foundation for reaching the 2050 limit, additional public dialogue is
needed to identify more specific actions to be implemented in the mid and long-term. This
report discusses the four key policy areas that need to be considered in order to attain the 2050
GHG limit: 1) energy efficiency and conservation; 2) renewable electricity and fuels; 3) creation
of natural CO2 sinks; and 4) dramatically reduced reliance on cars. While taking aggressive
action in these four key policy areas will provide the greatest GHG emission reductions over the
long term, transformation in these areas will require not only bold and effective public policy,
but also the creation of new technologies and markets that will drive a climate-friendly economy.
Within each of the four broad areas above, the State recommends an initial set of long-term
indicators for tracking progress toward meeting the 2050 limit:
•

•
•

•
•
•

•
•

The use of renewable energy sources in the State’s energy portfolio will continue to increase
aggressively until the majority of sources of electricity generation in New Jersey come from
carbon neutral sources.
All new buildings constructed after 2030 will have a net zero energy consumption through a
combination of energy efficiency requirements and renewable energy sources.
The current level of terrestrial carbon sequestration will increase by 1.53 million metric tons
(MMT) CO2 annually by 2020 and by 3.14 MMTCO2 per year by 2050. This will raise the
sequestration capacity from 7 MMTCO2 to at least 8.53 MMTCO2 annually by 2020 and to at
least 11.67 MMTCO2 annually by 2050. This will result from both an (a) expansion of the
green infrastructure 12 and the implementation of the other supplemental terrestrial carbon
sequestration measures 13 recommended in this report, and (b) investment 14 on at least half of
the approximately 700,000 acres of state lands that are being incorporated in the forest and
tidal marsh stewardship and restoration program under the Global Warming Solutions Fund
(GWSF) Act. Moreover, New Jersey will further increase its terrestrial sequestration in 2050
(by an additional 2.39 MMTCO2 annually) through new natural sink enhancement measures
on forest lands thereby raising the total target capacity to 14.07 MMTCO2 annually.
VMT growth between now and 2020 will be limited to a rate of no more than 1 percent per
year, and will stabilize thereafter.
All vehicular VMT in New Jersey will be “green” VMT within the next 15 years. 15
By 2050, ninety percent of development in New Jersey will occur in areas already served by
public infrastructure, and 99 percent of that development will be in the form of
redevelopment.
By 2050, at least 90 percent of all buildings in New Jersey will be fully occupied.
Transit ridership will double by 2050, and green commuting options will be expanded such
that all New Jersey residents will be guaranteed alternative transportation options to get to
work beyond single occupancy vehicles.

Given the scope of public policies that will be necessary to achieve the 2050 goal, this process
can greatly benefit from specific expertise and informed judgment. Recognizing such, the
GWRA recommends creation of an Independent Research Panel (IRP) to evaluate the climate12

Increase in area of preserved forestlands, wetlands, and associated agricultural landscapes by at least 10,000 acres
annually for 10 years through Garden State Preservation (GSPT) acquisitions. This projection assumes that there

Chapter 1: Introduction
Purpose
The purpose of this report is to present, pursuant to both Executive Order 54 and the Global
Warming Response Act (GWRA), recommendations for actions needed in order for the State to
meet its 2020 statewide greenhouse gas (GHG) limit. The report also discusses the key policy
areas that need to be considered in order to meet the 2050 statewide GHG limit.
Background
There is good evidence that as a result of ever-increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the
atmosphere, the Earth’s surface has warmed by over 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit (0.7 degrees Celsius)
during the past century, 16 and the evidence for warming during the last 60 years is
unequivocal. 17 These increased temperatures have contributed to:
• a reduction in the mass of the world’s alpine glaciers, 18
• an increase in permafrost thawing at high latitudes 19 and altitudes, 20
• a reduction in the extent and thickness of Arctic sea-ice, 21
• later freeze-up and earlier break-up of ice on rivers and lakes, 22 and
• an increase in the rate at which icebergs break off Antarctic ice shelves. 23
There is also well-documented evidence of an increase in the storage of heat near the surface of
the ocean, 24 and an overall rise in sea level, due in part to thermal expansion of the ocean and
melting of continental glaciers. 25 In addition, recent measurements indicate that the rate of
melting of the Greenland ice sheet has recently increased dramatically. 26, 27 If this melting
continues at the recent more rapid rate or accelerates further, the rate of sea level rise will
increase significantly. Continued GHG emissions at or above current rates are expected to cause
further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system during the 21st century
that will very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century. 28

In July 2007, the Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment (NECIA) released a report detailing the
projected impacts of climate change on the Northeast Region of the United States.29 While this
research echoed the global findings of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change’s (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, 30 it also pointed out that states in the Northeastern
United States are especially vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and that the potential
ecological, economic and public health impacts to New Jersey may be devastating. Not only
does climate change threaten New Jersey’s shoreline and ecology, but the socioeconomic
impacts of climate change stand to be profound and costly. The U.S. Global Change Research
Program recently released the most comprehensive report to date on the possible impacts of
climate change in the United States. 31 The report underscores the importance of mitigation by
comparing impacts resulting from higher versus lower emission scenarios. Choices made about
emissions in the next few decades will have far-reaching consequences for climate change
impacts.
Higher Temperatures:
Based on current research, it appears likely that additional warming in the range of 2 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) relative to 2000 will constitute dangerous climate change
due to likely effects on sea level and extermination of species. 32 Recent regional modeling
efforts project that, regardless of what is done now to reduce GHG emissions, average
temperatures across the Northeast, including New Jersey, will rise 2.5 to 4 degrees
Fahrenheit in winter and 1.5 to 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit in summer above historic levels over
the next several decades. Unless GHG emissions are significantly reduced, average
temperatures across the Northeast are predicted to rise up to 14 degrees Fahrenheit
(approximately 8 degrees Celsius) by the end of this century, and cities such as Trenton could
experience more than 20 days per summer with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 33
These rising temperatures are expected to have human health impacts, including:
•
•

•
•

Increased heat stress, especially for vulnerable urban populations, such as the elderly and
urban poor;
Increased levels of ground-level ozone, with the number of days failing to meet federal
air quality ozone standard projected to quadruple if local vehicle and industrial emissions
of ozone-forming pollutants are not reduced; 34
Accelerated secondary fine particle formation, which also have negative health impacts,
particularly to children and the elderly; and,
Potential facilitation of the northern spread of insects carrying diseases such as West Nile
virus, particularly in the winter season.

Natural ecosystems in New Jersey will also be impacted by warmer temperatures and
associated changes in the water cycle. These changes could lead to:
•

•

•

•

Loss of critical habitat and further stresses on some already-threatened and endangered
species. Climate-related habitat loss could lead to the extinction of some species and
additional stress on already-stressed fishery; 35
Impacts on water supply and agriculture, including the possibility that New Jersey’s
climate will become much less favorable to blueberry and cranberry growing. 36 The past
century is no longer a reasonable guide to the future for water management; 37
More intense rain events, since warm air holds more water vapor. However, warmer
temperatures also lead to greater evaporation and transpiration of moisture, causing drier
conditions in soils. In much of the Northeast, extended periods of dryness are predicted
to become much more frequent; 38 and,
Continued increases in fires, pests, disease pathogens, and invasive weed species. 39

Increasing Precipitation 40 :
Precipitation and runoff are likely to increase in the Northeast (and Midwest) in both the
winter and spring. Over the last 50 years, the Northeast has experienced snow pack
reductions, and observations indicate a transition to more rain and less snow in both the
Northeast and the Western regions of the country.
According to the State Climatologist, New Jersey is getting wetter. 41 Mean annual
precipitation in the State from 1895 to 1970 was 44.57 inches, while from 1971 and 2000 it
was 49.79 inches, and from 2000 to 2008 it was 51.75 inches. The additional atmospheric
moisture contributes to more overall precipitation in some areas, especially in much of the
Northeast. Such areas, where total precipitation is expected to increase the most, would also
experience the largest increase in heavy precipitation events. For the Northeast, projections
indicate spring runoff will advance by up to 14 days. Earlier runoff produces lower latesummer streamflows, which stress human and environmental systems through less water
availability and higher water temperatures.
Water-related impacts will include the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Heavy downpours increase the incidence of water-borne diseases and flood, resulting in
potential hazards to human life and health;
Floods disrupt transportation. Heavy downpours affect harbor infrastructure and inland
waterways;
Intense precipitation can delay spring planting and damage crops;
Earlier spring snow melts lead to increases in the number of forest fires; and,
With significant modifications in the major aspects of the water cycle, including
precipitation, the past is no longer a reliable guide for future water planning.

Rising seas:
Sea level rise due to climate change is a major concern for New Jersey. Sea level in the
Northeast region is projected to rise more than the global average. 42 The State is especially
vulnerable to significant impacts due to geologic subsidence, the topography of its coastline,
current coastal erosion and a high density of coastal development. 43 A sea level rise in line
with median projections would threaten the majority of New Jersey’s coastline. These
effects will be magnified during storm events, increasing the severity of storm-related
flooding in coastal and bay areas. It is predicted that by the end of the century, Atlantic City
will experience floods every one to two years that are as severe as those that now occur only
once per century. 44 In addition, if the recent measurements showing a dramatically increased
rate of melting of the Greenland ice sheet 45 are substantiated by further data, and if the
melting continues at this rate or accelerates further, the rate of sea level rise throughout the
world will increase significantly, and the severity and frequency of coastal flooding in New
Jersey will be even greater.
Economic Impact of Climate Change:
The possible economic impacts of climate change in New Jersey are enormous. 46 A key
impact, sea-level rise, puts the State's coastal-dependent, $35 billion tourism industry
statewide ($23 billion for just Monmouth, Ocean, Atlantic, and Cape May in 2006 47 ) in
jeopardy, with potentially dire repercussions on its economy. 48 The cost of climate-proofing
the State increases as sea level rises and hurricanes increase in number and intensity (which
many experts expect to happen as ocean waters warm). In addition to threatening New
Jersey’s tourism industry, climate change also creates economic risks to New Jersey’s ports
and agricultural tradition. Every year's delay in reducing CO2 emissions will increase the
final bill to New Jersey, including expenditures on adaptation.
However, the economic benefits of undertaking early actions to address climate change are
also noteworthy. Studies 49 show that industrialized countries could achieve major reductions
in carbon emissions at zero or negative net cost -- even before considering the benefits of
avoided damages from climate change. With appropriate policies, such as a permit auction

The magnitude of the costs involved at the global level have been studied and reported. The IPCC
Fourth Assessment Report (2007) suggests that the macro-economic effects of mitigation towards
stabilization (between 445 and 710 ppm of CO2eq, which would be achieved if New Jersey’s GHG
reduction limits, established by law and discussed herein, are achieved globally) in 2030 vary from a
small increase in global GDP to a 3 percent decrease. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate
Change (2006) suggests that the annual cost of emissions reduction leading to stabilization at 550 ppm
CO2e is likely to be around 1 percent of GDP by 2050.

system and improved energy efficiency, economic gains can offset the costs to the economy
from increases in energy prices due to carbon pricing. Implemented in the near-to-medium
term, these policies would result in sizeable benefits during the transition to a low carbon
future. The sooner the transition begins, the greater the benefits will be to the economy and
the climate. Economically-driven market transformation policies could include strict
building, appliance and auto efficiency standards, government rebates for efficient vehicles
paid for by fees on inefficient ones (e.g., feebates), financial incentives for the manufacture
of energy-efficient products and utility payments to buyers of energy-efficient equipment and
buildings. While New Jersey is already ranked 4th among the top ten states attracting venture
capital investments in companies in the clean energy economy 50 , these additional market
transformations will go a long way towards advancing New Jersey’s head start in creating a
“green” economy.
Recent research ranked available and nearly-available GHG control technologies in terms of
net cost per ton of carbon reduced, from least expensive to most expensive. 51 Twenty-five
percent of the economically-achievable emission reductions are from energy efficiency
measures, which ultimately pay for themselves by reducing the demand for energy. Under an
advanced energy efficiency scenario (i.e., recovering 25 percent of the total economicallyachievable potential of energy efficiency), one study estimates that the State could save $6.2
billion in avoided electricity and gas energy costs and provide a net benefit of about $3.8
billion over a 15-year period. 52 Also on the horizon is the potential pay-off from research
and development of clean energy power generation and of alternatives to highly warming
gases. New Jersey can gain a considerable technological head start in these critical areas
with its well-established university and industry research and development infrastructure.
Positive results will have implications for the State's economic output, income and
employment.
New Jersey’s Global Warming Response Act
The effects of increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere are accepted by most members of the
international scientific community as seriously detrimental to the ecosystems and environment of
the world. Ultimately, if steps are not taken to reverse these trends, the effects on humans, other
animals and plant life on Earth may be catastrophic. Convinced that the solutions to halt the
increase of GHGs in the atmosphere and reduce these emissions exist today, and that, as a global
issue, each country and region within a country must do its part to reduce GHG emissions, New
Jersey has become a leader in the effort to reduce GHG emissions through state level actions, as
well as regionally through collaboration with other states and by advocating for federal action.
Taking initiative on a statewide level, New Jersey enacted the Global Warming Response Act
(GWRA) (P.L. 2007, c.112) on July 6, 2007. This law codifies the targets for the reduction of
GHG emissions in New Jersey that were set forth previously on February 13, 2007 in the
Governor’s Executive Order 54. Specifically, the GWRA mandates reductions in GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, approximately a 20 percent reduction below estimated 2020
business-as-usual (BAU) emissions, followed by a further reduction of emissions to 80 percent
below 2006 levels by 2050. As required under the Act, this report specifically provides the

recommendations, as well as related actions to achieve the statutory 2020 statewide GHG limit,
and discusses the key policy areas that need to be considered in order to meet the 2050 statewide
GHG limit.

What is included in this report
Chapter 2 provides a detailed look at the core measures needed for New Jersey to meet the 2020
statewide GHG limit, including an economic assessment of these core measures. Chapter 3
outlines a number of recommendations and related actions, beyond the core 2020
recommendations, that can and should be implemented immediately, to allow the State to exceed
its 2020 limit on its way to meeting its 2050 limit, and to provide a cushion for the core 2020
actions. In addition, this chapter provides an assessment of the potential environmental and
economic impacts of a number of these measures. Chapter 4 discusses the fact that despite the
State’s best efforts to meet its ambitious GHG limits, New Jersey is already experiencing, and
will continue to experience, some degree of negative impact from the GHGs already present in
the atmosphere (e.g., sea level rise and ambient temperature increases), requiring the State to
develop an adaptation and preparedness plan. Chapter 5 outlines the State’s plans for
coordinating its climate change-related outreach and education efforts in the near term. Finally,
Chapter 6 discusses the State’s 2050 limit and next steps for implementing the recommendations
in this report.
New Jersey Statewide Greenhouse Gas Inventory
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) released the final version of
its first statewide GHG inventory 53 on October 31, 2008. 54 This inventory presents a
preliminary assessment of New Jersey’s statewide anthropogenic (human-caused) GHG
emissions (including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and certain
halogenated gases) and sinks (carbon storage) from 1990 to 2020, assuming both a business-asusual scenario and a scenario that attempts to meet the statewide 2020 reduction limit. The
purpose of these inventory and forecast estimates is to supply the State with a basis for
understanding New Jersey’s current and possible future GHG emissions, and thereby inform the
identification and analysis of policy options for mitigating those future GHG emissions.
As presented in the State’s GHG inventory report, (see http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/), New
Jersey statewide GHG emissions in 1990 were approximately 123 million metric tons (MMT) of
CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) per year. By 2004 55 , those emissions had risen 11 percent to

on March 19, 2008 and accepted written comment.

approximately 137 MMT. Under a business-as-usual scenario, emissions are projected to
increase 25 percent above 1990 levels to approximately 154 MMT per year by 2020. The State
recently completed GHG inventory estimates for 2005, 2006 and 2007 (see
http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/).
As shown by Figure 1.1, the State’s GHG inventory is divided into eight sectors.

Measurement Issues
GHG emissions are reported in millions of metric tons of CO2 equivalent, in keeping with international
scientific convention. A metric ton is 1,000 kilograms. It is approximately equivalent to 1.1 short tons.
The short ton, 2,000 pounds, is still used in some contexts. "Carbon dioxide equivalent" is a
consistent and comparable measure for reporting quantities of multiple types of greenhouse gases.
Some gases have a higher global warming effect than others, which is expressed by their Global
Warming Potential (GWP). Carbon dioxide has a GWP of 1, while other gases have much higher
GWPs (for example sulfur hexafluoride has a GWP of 22,800). Global Warming Potential is a
measure of the radiative efficiency (heat absorbing ability) of a particular gas relative to that of carbon
dioxide. That is, it is the ability of a gas to warm the atmosphere, as compared to an equivalent
release of carbon dioxide over a specified timescale (generally 100 years). The carbon dioxide
equivalency for a gas is obtained by multiplying the mass of a gas by its GWP. Key sectors in which
the GWP of a gas has a major impact include: waste management, which is a source of methane
(GWP 25) and nitrous oxide (GWP 298); and refrigeration and air conditioning, which are sources of
hydrofluorocarbons (GWPs range between 124 and 14,800).

21



Transportation and Land Use
Estimated emissions from on-road gasoline vehicles, on-road diesel vehicles, aviation, marine
vessels, and railroad and other transportation sources totaled approximately 49 MMT of CO2eq
in 2004. Combined, these five subcategories of transportation contributed approximately 35
percent of New Jersey’s gross GHG emissions in 2004. Therefore, transportation represents the
largest sector of New Jersey’s GHG emissions, with on-road gasoline consumption representing
the vast majority of those emissions. Transportation is also the fastest growing sector. This is
due to both: 1) the annual increase in the number of miles driven each year by New Jersey
motorists (otherwise known as vehicle miles traveled or VMT) since 1990 56 , and 2) the fact that
the fuel efficiency gains from cars over time have been negated by the increased use of light
trucks (e.g., sport utility vehicles). 57 Even though total VMT in New Jersey from 2007 to 2008
declined by approximately 3 percent, it appears that this decrease occurred in part because of a
26 percent increase in gasoline prices during the same period. If historic trends hold true, VMT
declines associated with spikes in gasoline prices tend to reverse themselves once gasoline prices
drop.
The total contribution of the transportation sector to GHG emissions is a product of several
factors, including the vehicles themselves, the overall level of travel activity, the technologies
used to power that activity, and the infrastructure used to support that activity. Since there is a
cause and effect link between land development and VMT (e.g., people living in the suburbs and
commuting greater distances to work and other activities), land use is directly and synergistically
linked to the transportation sector of New Jersey’s GHG inventory. As such, recommendations
to address transportation-related emissions must focus on each of these factors by ensuring the
proliferation of increasingly cleaner vehicles and fuels; encouraging eco-friendly driving and
vehicle maintenance habits; providing for clean, safe and reliable alternatives to singleoccupancy vehicles and reducing reliance on motor vehicles; and, improving the State’s overall
land use planning and design in order to reduce sprawl and encourage compact living that is
conducive to non-motor vehicle commuting.
Electric Generation
Estimated emissions from in-state electricity generation, in-state municipal solid waste (MSW)
resource recovery with electric generation, and imported electricity totaled approximately 34
MMT of CO2eq in 2004. Combined, these three subcategories of electricity generation
contributed approximately 24 percent of New Jersey’s gross GHG emissions in 2004. Therefore,
based on New Jersey’s GHG inventory, electric generation is the second largest contributor to
GHG emissions in the State, with in-state generation and imported electricity representing the
vast majority of those emissions. While the link between electricity generation and its
environmental impacts, particularly the air quality impacts, has long been understood in New
Jersey, there has also been an understanding that the environmental concerns must be balanced
with the need for a reliable and affordable supply of electricity, ensuring that new environmental
regulations do not negatively impact the reliability of power supplied in New Jersey.

Fortunately, solutions are available today to both reduce New Jersey’s energy demand and
“green” its energy supply, consequently reducing this sector’s “carbon footprint.”
“Local Impacts” From Distributed Generation
The Energy Master Plan includes strategies to expand the use of strategically-located distributed
generation resources throughout the State. Distributed generation resources refer to the generation of
electricity using small, modular units. They are "distributed" because they are located near the point of
use, unlike centralized large-scale power plants which are located farther away from the point of use
and utilize power lines to transmit to the consumer. Locating the generation of the electricity close to
its end user is advantageous because it reduces the loss of electricity through transmission lines and
reduces ratepayer impacts.
Distributed generation resources include renewable and clean technologies, such as wind turbines,
solar power, fuel cells, load reduction technologies, and battery storage systems, but also include
more traditional fossil-fuel based technologies, including microturbines, reciprocating engines, and
combined heat and power. Fossil fuel-based distributed generation resources have the potential to
emit more pollutants per unit of electricity than their centralized counterparts, and these pollutants
have the potential to impact areas near their location. Clearly, some forms of distributed generation
resources have little or no impact on local air quality (i.e. solar), while other forms (i.e. reciprocating
engines) do impact local air quality. Therefore, as the State moves forward with implementing the
EMP strategy for promoting distributed generation resources, it is critical to consider localized air
quality impacts as well electricity needs. Strategies to encourage the expansion of distributed
generation resources must emphasize the use of renewable and clean distributed resources and
demand response programs. For fossil fuel-based distributed generation resources, the NJDEP has
regulations that set emission limits to define clean distributed generation. Recent initiatives to help
reduce local impacts from electric generating resources include a rule to limit emissions from
generating units that operate primarily on high electric demand days (HEDD). This rule includes both
short and long term emission control strategies. The short term strategy achieves NOx emission
reductions, starting in 2009, based on a regional Memorandum of Understanding. The long term
strategy implements performance standards for HEDD units starting in 2015. Rules are also being
implemented to address particle emissions, specifically SO2 and NOx emissions, from coal-fired
boilers, including those serving electric generating units, by 2013. Taken together, these requirements
will help ensure that local impacts to public health and the environment will be reduced as the State
pursues strategies to achieve our GHG emission reduction goals and meet the future demand for
electricity.

Residential/Commercial
Estimated emissions from residential and commercial fuel use (excluding electricity use, which
is captured in the “Electric Generation” sector) totaled approximately 29 MMT of CO2eq in
2004. This category contributed approximately 20 percent of New Jersey’s gross GHG
emissions in 2004, and represents the third largest sector of New Jersey’s GHG emissions. The
primary source of GHGs from this category is CO2 that is released when fuels are burned to
generate space heat. However, the non-heat related sources of GHGs generated by New Jersey’s
residential and commercial sector for electricity use, while captured by the Electric Generation
sector of the State’s GHG inventory, are also impacted from a consumer perspective by energy
efficiency related control measures and options. For example, energy use in this sector is a
function of initial design and construction, as well as a building’s total operation over its
lifetime. Therefore, it is critical to focus not only on “green” design for new construction, but
also on ways to retrofit existing construction to be more environmentally-friendly and less
energy intensive. This can be done not only through structural changes (e.g., energy efficient
windows), but also through conversions to more energy efficient equipment and appliances.

23



Industrial
Estimated emissions from industrial fuel use (excluding electricity use, which is captured in the
Electric Generation sector) and processes, as well as natural gas transmission and distribution,
totaled approximately 20 MMT of CO2eq in 2004. As such, this category contributed
approximately 14 percent to New Jersey’s gross GHG emissions in 2004, representing the fourth
largest sector of New Jersey’s GHG emissions, including industries that are important to New
Jersey’s manufacturing economy. This sector can be further divided into several subcategories.
The largest of these subcategories include refineries, which emitted approximately 7.3 MMT of
CO2eq in 2004. Emissions of GHGs from other industrial sectors include pharmaceutical
manufacturing (0.65 MMT CO2eq in 2004), iron and steel (0.60 MMT CO2eq in 2004), food
processing (0.39 MMT CO2eq in 2004) and glass manufacturing (0.38 MMT CO2eq in 2004).
Several other smaller industrial subcategories have combined emissions in the range of 0.2 MMT
of CO2eq, much of which is likely from industrial boilers, which in itself represents an emissions
source that might need be addressed in a coordinated manner.
The GHGs from this category are primarily those released when fuels are burned to generate
process heat. The heat produced is used in a variety of different production processes to make a
wide range of products. Therefore, to address this category of emissions, it is important to focus
on how efficiently the heat is produced, as well as how efficiently it is used. There are non-heat
related sources of GHGs generated by New Jersey’s industry, including indirect releases from
generation from electricity used to power motors, pumps and other applications; releases of
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) used in cooling and refrigeration
equipment; and releases from vehicles used for employee commuting. While these emissions
are captured in other sectors of the State’s GHG inventory (i.e., Electric Generation, Non-CO2
Highly Warming Gases, and Transportation), the industries in this sector will need to consider
these sources and opportunities available to reduce their emissions in order to meet their overall
reduction goals.
Waste Management
Estimated emissions from waste management sources (landfills and Publicly Operated Treatment
Works (POTWs), also known as sewage treatment plants) totaled approximately 6 MMT of
CO2eq in 2004. As such, this sector contributed approximately 4 percent to New Jersey’s GHG
emissions in 2004, and represents the fifth largest sector of New Jersey’s gross GHG emissions.
Reductions from this category include capitalizing on the GHG benefits from increased recycling
of the State’s waste stream and controlling emissions from treatment and disposal facilities, as
well as utilizing energy efficiency opportunities to reduce their overall energy demand. As the
most densely populated State in United States, New Jersey produces a significant amount of
waste. Beneficial use of this waste, rather than direct disposal, is viewed by the NJDEP as an
opportunity to further reduce energy demands from conventional sources. As a co-benefit,
reducing GHG emissions from waste management operations goes hand-in-hand with sound
waste management strategies, such as reduce, reuse and recycle initiatives.

Climate Change and Waste Management
Waste management activities and infrastructure, including landfills and wastewater treatment plants,
present unique opportunities or GHG reductions.
Waste reduction - New Jersey’s primary policy is – and must continue to be – reduction in the use of
materials that become waste at the end of their useful life and reduction in the generation of waste at
its source. Waste that is never generated does not require energy for transportation, processing and
disposal, and does not degrade in a landfill to form methane.
Landfill methane - Many of the State’s largest landfills, including the currently operating regional
landfills, have installed methane collection systems to either flare or use the captured gas for energy
generation. Flaring the gas has the benefit of converting the methane to carbon dioxide, which has a
lower global warming potential than methane. Using the methane to generate electricity has the
added benefit of offsetting the use of fossil fuels to provide electric output. Many of the older, nonoperating landfills in the State do not have collection systems to capture and burn methane. Although
landfill methane emissions are declining nationally and in New Jersey, the State has identified a
number of non-operating landfills that may offer the greatest opportunity for methane control, and is
currently investigating ways to implement methane recovery and electricity generation at these
landfills.
Waste-to-energy - Opportunities exist for diversion of organic waste (or “biomass”) that is currently
destined for disposal in landfills, and its conversion to energy. In general, the logic of diverting
biomass material from landfills, where it would otherwise slowly degrade and release GHGs, to offset
fossil fuel use through the production of electricity and heat is readily apparent. In fact, the EMP sets
a goal of 900 megawatts of biomass-derived electric power by 2020.
Pursuit of this goal must be premised on a well-designed strategy that looks holistically at the lifecycle
impacts of such activity. Some of the significant considerations include finding enough material to
provide a steady, reliable feedstock; establishment of strict parameters around the types of biomass
approved for energy recovery; ensuring that biomass diversion and processing facilities and
equipment can meet State and local permitting requirements designed to protect local air quality, noise
and other impacts; and disposal of any resulting residues.

equipment can meet State and local permitting requirements designed to protect local air quality, noise
and other impacts; and disposal of any resulting residues.
Wastewater treatment - Waste-to-energy and energy efficiency are two methods for reducing the
carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plants. Wastewater treatment systems use a variety of
methods to remove organic matter from wastewater. Systems using anaerobic methods (without
oxygen) can generate significant quantities of methane. Like landfill methane, this methane can be
captured, burned and used to generate electricity. Systems using aerobic methods (with oxygen)
require aeration, which represents the largest use of energy at many of the State’s treatment systems.
While selection of the most appropriate treatment method for a wastewater treatment facility depends
upon a number of factors, the foremost being the achievement of clean water standards, energy
usage and its associated costs are also important considerations. Therefore, for existing wastewater
treatment facilities, undertaking a thorough energy audit is highly desirable. Also, all systems,
regardless of treatment method used, require pumping to move wastewater, which is also energy
intensive. Higher efficiency motors and pumps and other process changes can help reduce electricity
use in these operations. Some wastewater treatment systems may also have the capability to utilize
methane generated on-site to offset energy purchases for facility operation. One way to use the
methane is in combined heat and power units. The rules for the Environmental Infrastructure Trust
Financing Program state that all wastewater, water and stormwater projects need to consider
opportunities to reduce energy use or to recover energy as part of their facility plans and project
reports. See NJAC 7:22-3.11(d)5iii(7).

Non-CO2 Highly Warming Gases
In addition to CO2, several other gases have the potential to warm the Earth’s atmosphere.
Emissions of these gases represent 4 MMT CO2eq in 2004, contributing approximately 3 percent
of New Jersey’s GHG gross emissions for that year. The most common use of these gases is as
heat transfer agents in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment. Without further action,
GHG emissions from this category are expect to increase significantly. At the current rate of
increase in emissions of these gases, their relative contribution to global warming will increase
as other GHG emissions are reduced. A recent report estimates that HFC releases could account
for between 28 to 45 percent of total global radiative forcing by 2050, if CO2 is reduced in other
sectors and nothing is done to reduce HFC releases. 58 This projected increase is largely due to
the consistent growth in the use of many of these substances, which are replacements for
stratospheric ozone-depleting substances that are being phased out globally pursuant to the
Montreal Protocol. In the United States, these phase-outs are implemented through Title VI of
the Clean Air Act. Although these replacement chemicals do not deplete stratospheric ozone,
many have high global warming potentials (GWP).
While many of these increases are projected to occur in developing nations, releases in New
Jersey are also expected to increase significantly. Releases of these gases in New Jersey are
expected to increase to 8.4 MMT CO2eq by 2020, representing 5.5 percent of the statewide GHG
inventory based on BAU projections and 7.2 percent of the inventory if expected reductions of
CO2 in other sectors are considered.
Other
New Jersey’s 2004 inventory contains another category which includes emissions from
agriculture and land clearing. Estimated emissions from this category totaled approximately 2
MMT of CO2eq in 2004, contributing about 1 percent of New Jersey’s GHG gross emissions for
that year.
Terrestrial Sequestration
The growth of vegetation and the accumulation of soil organic matter, especially in forested land,
act as a carbon sink, removing approximately 7 MMT of CO2eq from New Jersey’s atmosphere
in 2004. This “absorption” of CO2 offset approximately 5 percent of New Jersey’s gross GHG
emissions in 2004. While most of the recommendations outlined in this report focus on reducing
the amount of CO2 and other GHG emissions emitted into the atmosphere, it is just as important
to maintain, and increase, the natural sinks that absorb and sequester CO2. There is a growing
body of research that indicates a significant potential for creating GHG mitigation through
agriculture, forestry and vegetative measures.
Forests play a critical role in climate change by sequestering or storing large quantities of carbon
by absorbing CO2. Photosynthesis and respiration are the essential machinery by which forests
store and release carbon. As a tree grows and increases in biomass, it absorbs CO2 from the air
and, through the process of photosynthesis, uses solar energy to store carbon in its roots, stems,
branches, and foliage. Some carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2 during

respiration, but a living tree acts as a carbon “sink”, storing more carbon than it releases. Trees
continue to accumulate carbon until they reach maturity, at which point about half of the average
tree’s dry weight will be carbon. Nationwide, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that
forest, crop and grassland conservation efforts can play a unique role in reducing the GHG
intensity of the U.S. economy. Increasing carbon sequestration in soils has become a viable way
of augmenting the reduction of atmospheric GHG emissions. A 2007 study 59 found that forest
management practices would provide the lowest cost offset options in most regions of the United
States.

Chapter 2: Ensuring Attainment of the Statewide 2020 Greenhouse Gas Limit
Three core measures form the backbone of New Jersey’s plan to meet its statewide 2020 GHG
limit. The core measures implement the:
•
•
•

New Jersey Energy Master Plan (EMP);
New Jersey Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program; and,
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) program.

The core measures are targeted at reducing GHG emissions from the two largest contributors to
New Jersey GHG emissions – transportation and energy – and they lay the groundwork for all
future actions in these areas.
According to an analysis conducted by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
(NJDEP) (included as Appendix 1 of this report) the three core measures, if fully successful and
fully implemented on schedule, would result in a reduction of approximately 38 MMT CO2eq
below the estimated business-as-usual emission level of 154 MMT CO2eq, or 116 MMT CO2eq,
by 2020. This would allow the State to meet its statewide 2020 limit of 123 MMT CO2eq.
Figure 2.1 shows the impact of not implementing these core recommendations, but instead
allowing for a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. Table 2.1 provides the supporting data for
Figure 2.1.

All emission and reduction quantities are estimates. The actual statewide emissions up to and including
2004 are unlikely to be more than 5 percent higher or lower than these estimates. The projections to 2020,
and the proposed reductions, are considerably less certain. Reductions attributable to RGGI are difficult
to quantify at a statewide level because the RGGI limits are regional. For purposes of the 2020 estimates
that reflect the various reductions, the emissions from New Jersey facilities covered by RGGI are
considered to be equal to New Jersey's estimated share of the total RGGI limit. All numbers are subject to
revision by the NJDEP as better information becomes available.

GHG Co-Benefits from Controls to Meet the National Ambient Air Quality Standards
The entire State of New Jersey is currently designated by the USEPA as nonattainment for the 1997
8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). In addition, 13 of New Jersey’s 21
counties are designated as nonattainment for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. PM2.5, also known as fine
particulate matter, in the atmosphere is composed of a complex mixture of particles in the atmosphere:
sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium particles; particle-bound water; black carbon (also known as soot or
elemental carbon); and many organic compounds, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs). In
response to the USEPA nonattainment designations, the NJDEP has submitted attainment
demonstration plans designed to show how New Jersey will attain these standards by 2010. Also, the
State has submitted a Regional Haze Plan to the USEPA, which establishes progress goals and
control strategies for improving visibility (which is primarily impeded by fine particles in the
atmosphere) in federally protected areas. All of these plans commit the State to implement a number
of new control measures.
The control measures being implemented to meet the Federal ozone, PM2.5 and Regional Haze
requirements are also beneficial in the State’s efforts to address climate change. Since black carbon
(soot) and ozone have an atmospheric warming effect, the numerous control measures already under
consideration or being implemented by the State to address these pollutants, such as diesel idling
infrastructure alternatives (e.g., truck stop electricification), cleaner heating fuel, NOx reductions on
high electric demand days, and requiring VOC recovery at refineries, will also address their impact on
climate change. In fact, since the atmospheric lifetime of black carbon and ozone are so much shorter
than those of the long-lived GHGs, days as opposed to years for CO2, methane and
hydrofluorocarbons, reductions in these short-lived species may prove to be of some importance in
slowing climate change in the short term.

Energy Master Plan
In October 2006, the State began a comprehensive planning process to generate a new statewide
Energy Master Plan (EMP). The EMP plans for the State’s energy needs, and is fundamentally
designed to guide New Jersey toward a responsible energy future with adequate, reliable energy
supplies that are both environmentally responsible and competitively priced.
The EMP focuses on the energy usage issues associated with electricity and heating, and refers
the energy-related transportation issues to this GWRA recommendation report. The EMP sets
forth several major goals for achieving its fundamental charge of ensuring a reliable, costeffective electricity and heating supply that is environmentally sound and allows for economic
progress in the State. Meeting these goals also ensures that the State will achieve the necessary
GHG emission reductions from the electricity generation and heating sector to meet the
GWRA’s GHG limits, and provides the State with a roadmap to stay on track to ensure the
necessary emission reductions in this sector. Specifically, the EMP establishes the following
goals for New Jersey:
•
•
•
•

Maximize energy conservation and energy efficiency to achieve reductions in statewide
energy consumption of at least 20 percent by 2020;
Reduce peak electricity demand for electricity by 5,700 MW by 2020;
Strive to exceed the current renewable portfolio standard and meet 30 percent of the State’s
electricity needs from renewable sources by 2020;
Develop a 21st century energy infrastructure that supports the goals and action items of the
Energy Master Plan, ensures reliability of the system, and makes available additional tools
to consumers to manage their energy consumption; and,
30



Invest in innovative clean energy technologies and businesses to stimulate the industry’s
growth in New Jersey.

The EMP recommends 20 specific actions to achieve these five goals, which are summarized in

Biofuels: Ensuring Real GHG Emission Reductions
Biofuels can either contribute to reducing GHG emissions or they can actually increase GHG
emissions depending on: feedstock choice, where and how the feedstock is grown, the biofuel
production process, and other factors, such as transporting the fuel to its end use. A lifecycle analysis
that includes all of these factors must be performed on each type of biofuel to accurately assess its net
impact on GHG emissions relative to conventional petroleum fuels such as gasoline and diesel.
Although practical constraints on the yields from biofuel feedstocks and expectations about new
technologies limit even optimistic projections concerning biofuels to ultimately replace only 10-20
percent of the nation’s projected volumetric gasoline and diesel demand (Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007, Based on the Applicable Volumes of Renewable Fuel table in Section 202 –
Renewable Fuel Standard, 36 billion gallons of Renewable Fuel in 2022 is 12-16 percent of the
projected U.S. demand for gasoline and diesel fuel assuming a yearly growth rate of 1-2 percent. This
does not account for the 60-70 percent reduced energy content of ethanol relative to petroleum
gasoline.), it is important that biofuels are evaluated and generated with the following principles and
issues in mind:
•

•

•

•

All life cycle effects must be accounted for and the best science used to calculate net GHG
emissions for each type of biofuel. In general, the most favorable lifecycle GHG emissions are for
biofuels produced from waste materials (such as waste greases, agricultural residues and trash)
and, native, non-invasive, sustainably grown and harvested herbaceous perennial energy crops
(such as switchgrass) and short rotation woody crops (such as poplar). In general, the least
favorable lifecycle GHG emissions are for biofuels produced from crops that require significant use
of fertilizer, water and fossil fuels in their production. In addition, biofuel production processes that
use energy from renewable sources result in lower contributions to lifecycle GHG emissions than
biofuel production processes that use energy from fossil fuels such as natural gas or coal.
Biofuel production can take place on existing cropland as well as on marginal lands. Direct and
indirect land use effects must be included in the assessment of lifecycle GHG emissions,
especially when land-use conversion is involved. Scientists have recently identified the land use
effects of biofuels as being an extremely significant factor in the assessment of the GHG impacts
of biofuels relative to conventional petroleum fuels. For example, a land use effect occurs when
forest is converted to agricultural land because additional land is needed to grow biofuel
feedstocks. GHG emissions that result from the clearing of the forest land and the changes to the
terrestrial sequestering rate of the land that has been converted from forest to agricultural must be
accounted for in the overall biofuel GHG emissions analysis. These land use effects were not
included in earlier lifecycle analyses. However, recent studies have concluded that they are
extremely significant and must be added to the lifecycle analysis. One study has estimated that
when land use effects for corn-based ethanol are taken into account, the lifecycle GHG emissions
go from a decrease of about 20 percent to an increase of about 100 percent relative to petroleum
fuel over a 30 year period. ("Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases
Through Emissions from Land Use Change", Timothy Searchinger, Ralph Heimlich, R.A.
Houghton, Fengxia Dong, Amani Elobeid, Jacinto Fabiosa, Simla Tokgoz, Dermot Hayes, and
Tun-Hsiand Yu, Sciencexpress (www.sciencexpress.org). February 7, 2008). The
recommendations below would address land use issues specifically and suggest how to avoid
unintended consequences which can prevent biofuels from achieving their potential.
(http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_energy/ucs-bioenergy-principles.pdf).
Establish performance-based policies that reward reductions in GHG emissions over a fuel’s full
life cycle, based on the best available information and vetted in an open and transparent process.
California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard is an excellent example of a life-cycle performance-based
fuel policy. Because the science of climate change, including indirect effects, is still evolving and
new studies will improve the understanding over time, the fuel policies should include a
mechanism to ensure that life cycle emissions metrics used for compliance can be easily updated
as the science advances.
Set realistic expectations about the scope of biomass production instead of establishing somewhat
arbitrary production mandates or pricing mechanisms. Based on current knowledge, sustainable
biomass can be obtained from waste products such as agricultural residues, forestry residues, and
municipal and construction waste. Any significant expansion beyond existing resources, however,

33

•

must be based on a sound scientific determination that the required volume of biomass can be
produced in a sustainable manner. (Perlack, R.D., et al. Biomass as feedstock for a bioenergy
and bioproducts industry: The technical feasibility of a billion-ton annual supply. TM-2005-66.
U.S.DOE).
Account for all of the sustainability and environmental impacts associated with biofuels. There are
other unintended consequences associated with many types of biofuels. These include
environmental sustainability issues associated with water use and loss of biodiversity. In addition,
if sustainable farming practices are not followed, environmental impacts from the use of chemical
fertilizers and pesticides could be significant. Using invasive plant species as feedstock for
biofuels would also have a deleterious impact on biodiversity. Finally, recently publicized
concerns over the impacts of food availability and prices have been the subject of considerable
debate.
Consider the GHG benefits of all potential uses of biomass to generate alternative energy.
Alternatives to using biomass to produce liquid transportation fuels may provide higher levels of
energy efficiency (i.e., a greater portion of the energy derived from the biomass is used for useful
purposes) and result in greater GHG reductions. For example, there may be greater GHG
reductions if biomass is used for electricity generation instead of coal or if biomass is used for
biogas production as a substitute for natural gas (biogas production is growing rapidly in Europe).
Also, the electricity or biogas can ultimately be used for transportation as larger numbers of plug-in
hybrids, pure electric vehicles and natural gas vehicles enter the fleet.
Pursue promising biofuels of the future. New technologies and further development of existing
technologies may produce biofuels in the future that overcome many of the yield constraints and
sustainability problems associated with current options. One example that may hold promise
involves the production of liquid fuels from algae. Theoretical yields of 5,000 gallons of biodiesel
per acre per year have been estimated for an operation in which algae contained in reaction
vessels is exposed to CO2 from power plant exhaust. This should be compared with a production
rate of about 300 gallons of corn ethanol a year per acre and a production rate of about 60 gallons
of biodiesel from an acre of soybeans per year (Bourne, Joel, “Green Dreams”, National
Geographic, October, 2007, pages 57-59).

In support of the NJBPU’s efforts to implement the EMP, the New Jersey Economic
Development Authority (NJEDA), in conjunction with the NJBPU, the NJDEP and the
Governor’s Office has developed the following product portfolio of grants, loans and
investments to help businesses with projects that advance the goals of the state’s Energy Master
Plan.
Clean Energy Manufacturing Fund
Financing is available through the Clean Energy Manufacturing Fund (CEMF) (www.njeda.com)
on a competitive solicitation basis. The program encourages new jobs and the growth of Class I
renewable energy manufacturers or energy-efficient manufacturers in the State while addressing
the goals of the State’s Energy Master Plan. The NJBPU is responsible for determining the
technical eligibility of all projects; the NJEDA prepares underwriting analysis and makes a
financial feasibility determination on all applications.
Grants and loans totaling up to $3.3 million per company per project are available under two
separate program components. The first piece is a traditional grant that provides up to 10 percent
of total CEMF funds ($300,000) for identifying and securing a leased or purchased site,
completing initial project facility design, and obtaining permits and regulatory approvals to
operate a facility. To receive the grant, companies must be able to provide a 50 percent cash
match of total project costs from other sources/collaborators. At closing, 20 percent of the
approved funds will be advanced for upfront seed money with the remainder to be paid after
work has been completed and invoices have been submitted.
34



The second part is a zero-interest loan up to a maximum $3 million that can be used to support
site improvements, equipment procurement and facility construction/completion. Eligible
companies must have a minimum 50 percent match of total project costs from firmly committed,
non-state-derived matching support. No more than one-half of the total project costs of the funds
approved may be advanced prior to commercial production.
To take advantage of the funding, applicant companies must be for-profit entities (including
corporate joint ventures) that are planning to manufacture eligible products in New Jersey and
are entering or expanding within the manufacturing stage of commercial development.
Preference is given to those projects that demonstrate a greater percentage of the project being
designed, manufactured, processed, assembled or made ready for commercial sale at the
company’s project facility in New Jersey.
Energy efficiency technologies refer to those technologies, equipment or systems that use
electricity or natural gas as a principal input resulting in a substantial increase in the efficient use
and/or conservation of these two fuels. Qualifying under the program are energy efficiency
equipment and technology that reduce electric or natural gas consumption such as furnaces,
boilers and air-conditioning systems with higher efficiencies than adopted New Jersey building
energy codes or federal or New Jersey appliance standards, as well as lighting systems, including
LED lights and energy monitoring and control systems. Also eligible are Class I renewable
energy, such as photovoltaic, solar, wind energy, renewably fueled fuel cells, wave tidal,
sustainably harvested biomass and methane gas from landfills.
The NJEDA also has been working closely with the DEP to support the Regional Greenhouse
Gas Initiative (RGGI). To best encourage energy efficiency measures within the commercial and
industrial sectors and encourage the use of renewable energy, the NJEDA is offering the Clean
Energy Solutions Capital Investment loan/grant program, capitalized through RGGI proceeds.
The Clean Energy Solutions Capital Investment Loan/Grant provides financial support in the
form of no-interest loans and grants to support commercial, institutional and industrial entity
end-use energy efficiency projects, combined heat and power (CHP) 62 production facilities, and
new state-of-the-art efficient electric generation facilities, including renewable energy
applications. New Jersey-based commercial, institutional or industrial entities that meet
regulatory requirements and plan to create or maintain jobs in New Jersey are eligible. Funding
may be used for real estate or equipment and there is a $1 million minimum total project cost.
Funding will be provided for up to a 10-year term with amortization for up to 20 years based on
need.
Maximum/Limits:
•

•
•

100% loan, a portion of which can become a grant based on NJEDA scoring criteria.
• Maximum grant awarded, based on scoring criteria, will be lesser of 80% of amount
requested or $2.5 million, with the remainder as loan.
• Commercial buildings with energy efficiency projects will be limited to maximum
grant amount of 20%.
Total NJEDA/RGGI funding cannot exceed $5 million per applicant.
Aggregate state funding cannot exceed 50% of project cost.

Loan/Grant, visit www.njeda.com.
The Energy Master Plan also includes two additional topic areas considered key to the success of
charting New Jersey’s electric generation and space heating future: the responsibility of State
entities and operations to lead by example, and the need for continued advocacy and analysis by
the State of New Jersey with the federal and regional authorities which shape New Jersey’s
energy paradigm. Key points of each follow:
The State Leading by Example:
•
•
•
•
•

Operate State facilities and equipment as efficiently as possible.
Pursue immediate energy conservation measures, such as investing in cost-effective energy
efficiency projects at State facilities.
Work with the State Legislature to create an energy savings improvement program.
Optimize State facility and operations energy supply portfolio to reduce GHG emissions.
Develop a State facility demand response program.

Continued Advocacy and Analysis:
•

•
•
•

New Jersey will work with PJM (the regional electric grid administrator) to modify or
replace the Reliability Pricing Model with a mechanism that focuses incentives on new
generation capacity, demand response, and energy efficiency.
New Jersey will work to help shape PJM’s planning of the electric transmission system to
better protect New Jersey’s economy and the environment.
New Jersey will continue to monitor the data, forecasts and analysis provided by the federal
Energy Information Administration to keep abreast of forecasts for future fuel supplies.
The NJBPU will continue to review annually, in a transparent, public proceeding with all
necessary expertise, the procurement of electric energy, capacity, and other electricityrelated requirements to supply Basic Generation Service.

Low Emission Vehicle Program
On November 28, 2005, New Jersey adopted a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program modeled
after California’s LEV Program. 63 New Jersey’s LEV program contains three components:
vehicle emission standards, fleetwide emission requirements, and a Zero Emission Vehicle
(ZEV) sales requirement. Specifically, this rule requires all new vehicles offered for sale in New
Jersey to be California certified for emissions beginning January 1, 2009.
Implementation of the GHG component of the New Jersey LEV program roughly doubles the
GHG reductions by 2020 relative to the GHG reductions from the current federal Corporate
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, and is therefore critical to the State’s efforts to meet
its GWRA limits. The NJDEP proceeded with the implementation of its LEV program
beginning with model year 2009.
On September 28, 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of
Transportation jointly proposed federal motor vehicle GHG emission standards and related fuel
63

38 N.J.R. 497(b), (January 17, 2006).
36



economy standards for model years 2012 through 2016. 64 Once adopted, this federal motor
vehicle control program could impact the GHG emission reductions projected for the New Jersey
LEV program. The State is in the process of evaluating the impact of the federal program on the
State’s assumptions regarding greenhouse gas reductions from new motor vehicle initiatives.
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
New Jersey is one of the 10 states participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
(RGGI), a ten-state 65 cooperative effort designed to implement a regional mandatory cap-andtrade program in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic addressing CO2 emissions from Electric
Generating Units (EGUs) (i.e., power plants). Hosting its first allowance auction on September
25, 2008, RGGI became the first mandatory market-based CO2 emissions reduction program in
the U.S. Specifically, the program caps regional power plant CO2 emissions from 2009 through
2014 and then reduces those emissions 10 percent by 2018. RGGI's phased approach means that
reductions in the CO2 cap will initially be modest, providing predictable market signals and
regulatory certainty. Electricity generators will be able to plan for and invest in lower-carbon
alternatives and avoid dramatic electricity price impacts.
The design of RGGI reduces GHG emissions while investing in energy efficiency, clean energy
technologies, and renewable energy. First, the mandatory cap on CO2 emissions from regulated
power plants ensures emission reductions over time. Second, allowances to emit CO2 are sold
via a quarterly regional auction to generate proceeds that are strategically reinvested to benefit
energy consumers and transform markets to promote energy efficiency and clean energy
technologies.
The auctioning of allowances is a particularly innovative element of RGGI design and, in New
Jersey, is expected to yield approximately $60 million annually for investment in clean energy
programs and other benefits to consumers. Such investments make New Jersey businesses more
competitive, create jobs immediately, stimulate new markets for energy efficiency, renewable
energy, and innovative low-carbon technologies, reduce the cost of cutting GHG emissions and
provide relief to ratepayers. The Global Warming Solutions Fund stipulates that 60 percent of
New Jersey RGGI proceeds are to be invested by the NJEDA in end-use energy efficiency
projects, combined heat and power facilities, renewable energy, and innovative technologies to
reduce GHG emissions (as noted in the previous discussion regarding NJEDA’s Clean Energy
Solutions Capital Investment Program); 20 percent of the proceeds are to be used by the NJBPU
to support programs to reduce electricity demand or costs to consumers in the low- and
moderate-income residential sectors; 10 percent is allocated to the NJDEP to support programs
in which local governments implement measures to reduce GHG emissions; and the remaining
10 percent is allocated to the NJDEP to support programs that enhance opportunities for
sequestration of CO2 through stewardship and restoration of the State’s forests and tidal marshes.
RGGI is composed of individual CO2 Budget Trading Programs in each of the ten participating
states. These programs are implemented through state regulations, based on a RGGI Model Rule,
and are linked through CO2 allowance reciprocity. Regulated power plants are able to use a CO2
allowance issued by any of the ten participating states to demonstrate compliance with the state
program governing their facility. RGGI also allows these facilities to employ offsets (GHG

agreeing to adopt the program. Maryland joined RGGI in mid-2007, and Massachusetts and Rhode
Island joined in January 2007.

emissions reduction or sequestration projects at sources beyond the electricity sector) to meet
their compliance obligations. Taken together, the ten individual state programs function as a
single regional compliance market for carbon emissions. New Jersey filed the adoption of its
RGGI regulations on October 10, 2008 (see the November 17, 2008 New Jersey Register). Since
December 2008, New Jersey participates in quarterly regional CO2 allowance auctions.
Estimated Economic Impacts of the Core Recommendations
The Rutgers University Center for Energy, Economic & Environmental Policy (CEEEP)
evaluated the economic impacts of these three core recommendations. Specifically, the CEEEP
first used the R/ECON(TM) model to determine the economic impacts of implementing New
Jersey's EMP initiatives, using Business-as-Usual and Alternative Scenarios under different fuel
price scenarios. As a part of the EMP modeling, RGGI was utilized as the CO2 policy for 2010
and 2015, whereas CEEEP assumed that a national cap-and-trade program would be in place in
2020 for the electric generating utility sector. This R/ECON(TM) modeling showed that the
economic effects of implementing the EMP and RGGI were negligible, even without accounting
for the benefits from environmental “externalities” from these programs.
CEEEP then used the R/ECON(TM) model to determine the additional economic effects of
implementing the New Jersey LEV program. The modeling demonstrated that the LEV
program, in conjunction with the implementation of the EMP initiatives and RGGI, would have a
negligible impact on the State's economy, even before accounting for the economic benefits of
reduced emissions. A more detailed summary of CEEEP’s analysis is included as Appendix 2 of
this report.
It is critical to stress that one serious limitation of the CEEEP analysis is that the R/ECON(TM)
model does not account for environmental “externalities”, and therefore understates the positive
economic impacts associated with emission reductions. For example, while the CEEEP model
can assess the small additional cost of buying a low emission vehicle, it does not factor in the
economic benefit that society gains from creating less pollution (i.e. improved impacts on health
care costs associated with air pollution).
It should also be noted that the core measures as described earlier involve important investments
in the New Jersey economy. For example, the Energy Master Plan envisions major expansions in
the State's clean energy facilities such as wind power and solar photovoltaic systems and major
improvements in the energy efficiency of the state's businesses, residences, and institutions. The
former will help grow the State's green economy, while the latter will make New Jersey
businesses more competitive with those in other states and countries and help reduce consumer
energy bills. Similarly, the proceeds from the auctions of CO2 allowances under RGGI are being
used to fund measures such as combined heat and power, solar photovoltaic systems, improved
forest management, and local measures to address climate change. Measures like these help will
create new jobs as well as reduce GHG emissions.
It is important to recognize that while the complete and timely implementation of these three
core initiatives form the backbone of New Jersey’s plan to meet its statewide 2020 GHG limit,
their success is built upon a foundation formed by numerous other actions to address climate
change that the State has already taken or are currently underway. In short, New Jersey is
currently in a position to be able to meet its 2020 statewide GHG limit through full
implementation of the Energy Master Plan, RGGI and its LEV program specifically because the
State has been aggressive in development of programs and policies designed to address GHG
38



emissions. For a comprehensive list of the New Jersey accomplishments and on-going
initiatives that formed this foundation, as well as a summary of the other GWRA requirements,
please see Appendix 3. In addition, it is important to note that New Jersey is not acting alone in
its efforts to combat climate change. Many other states are taking actions similar to New Jersey
to do their part. For more information on what other states are doing, see Appendix 4.
Moving Forward in Light of Action at the Federal Level
The United States has taken recent steps forward at the federal level for development of national
climate change policy. In general, these developments complement policies and programs
already underway and planned in New Jersey. The United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) granted California’s waiver request regarding greenhouse gas emissions
standards for new motor vehicles. This decision is complemented by President Obama’s
announcement on May 19, 2009 of his proposal to set new fuel economy standards for motor
vehicles, covering model years 2012-2016, and ultimately requiring an average fuel economy
standard of 35.5 mpg in 2016. The new proposed standards are projected to save 1.8 billion
barrels of oil over the life of the program with a fuel economy gain averaging more than 5
percent per year and a reduction of approximately 900 MMT of GHG emissions. This would
surpass the CAFE law passed by Congress in 2007 that required an average fuel economy of 35
mpg in 2020. As part of the federal action, from 2012 to 2016, California and states that have
adopted the California LEV program (including New Jersey) will allow automobile
manufacturers to comply with the LEV GHG standards by complying with the federal GHG
standards for the same model years. Beyond 2016, California may propose the more stringent
Pavley III GHG standards for 2016 and beyond at which point USEPA may consider proposal of
the Pavley III standards as the federal GHG standards for the same time period. While the new
federal fuel economy standard will lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
nationally, the short-term reduction (2012-16) in New Jersey will be less than what was
anticipated under New Jersey’s adherence to the California standard. Nevertheless, in the longterm and nationally, significant emission reductions are anticipated both in New Jersey and
nationally as a result of the federal action.
Additionally, on December 9, 2009, USEPA adopted its proposed endangerment finding in
response to a finding by the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), that
greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act. In its action, USEPA found
that current and projected concentrations of the mix of six key greenhouse gases—carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—in the atmosphere threaten the public
health and welfare of current and future generations. This is referred to as the “endangerment
finding.” USEPA also found that the combined emissions of CO2, CH4, N2O, and HFCs from
new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of
these key greenhouse gases, and hence to the threat of climate change. This is referred to as the
“cause or contribute finding.” The endangerment finding pursuant to the Clean Air Act does not
by itself automatically trigger regulation under the entire Act. However, it lays the foundation
for future regulatory action by USEPA subject to the provisions of the Clean Air Act.
In a separate action, USEPA adopted a rule on October 30, 2009 that requires mandatory
reporting of GHG emissions from large sources in the United States. The rule requires collection
of GHG emissions data to inform future policy decisions. Suppliers of fossil fuels or industrial
greenhouse gases, manufacturers of vehicles and engines, and facilities that emit 25,000 metric
tons or more per year of GHG emissions will be required to submit annual reports to EPA. The
39



gases covered by the rule are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and other
fluorinated gases including nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and hydrofluorinated ethers (HFE). The
most significant differences between the USEPA and the requirements for a mandatory reporting
program in the New Jersey Global Warming Response Act are: 1) the USEPA rule does not
provide states information for upstream fossil fuel suppliers; 2) the USEPA threshold of 25,000
tons/yr does not capture many facilities that have been reporting CO2 or methane to New Jersey
since 2003; and 3) the USEPA rule does not provide states information on industrial gases (i.e.
hydrofluorocarbons), from upstream manufacturers/distributors or downstream users.
Finally, on September 30, 2009, the USEPA announced a proposal designed to tailor the major
source applicability thresholds for greenhouse gas emissions under the Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. The proposal also sets a PSD
significance level for greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal would cover nearly 70 percent of
the nation’s largest stationary source greenhouse gas emitters, including power plants, refineries,
and cement production facilities, while shielding small businesses and farms from permitting
requirements. New or modified facilities with GHG emissions that trigger PSD permitting
requirements would need to apply for a revision to their operating permits to incorporate the best
available control technologies and energy efficiency measures to minimize GHG emissions.
These controls are determined on a case-by-case basis during the PSD process. The USEPA
estimates that 400 new sources and modifications would be subject to PSD review each year for
GHG emissions. Less than 100 of these would be newly subject to PSD. In total, approximately
14,000 large sources would need to obtain operating permits for GHG emissions under the
operating permits program. About 3,000 of these sources would be newly subject to CAA
operating permit requirements as a result of this action. The majority of these sources are
expected to be municipal solid waste landfills.
Clearly, these administrative actions at the federal level support the policies inherent in New
Jersey’s initiatives over the past decade. With an engaged federal partner, New Jersey needs to
assess the effective mix of state and federal action that will be most effective in addressing
climate change. Nowhere is this need more evident than in consideration of legislative proposals
currently pending in Congress.
The American Clean Energy and Security (ACES) Act of 2009 passed the U.S. House of
Representatives on June 26, 2009. Among other things, the ACES Act establishes a combined
efficiency and renewable electricity standard, develops a strategy for promoting carbon capture
and sequestration, places performance standards on new coal-fired power plants, supports state
and local adoption of advanced building codes, supports state building retrofit programs,
instructs states to submit goals for transportation-related GHG emission reductions, establishes a
cap-and-trade program covering multiple greenhouse gases and sectors, and establishes a
national climate change adaptation strategy. This expansive scope clearly calls for ongoing and
national discussions about the most effective means to meet the intent and provisions of the Act
as well as any upcoming federal climate change policies.
On November 5, 2009, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Security Act passed the Senate
Committee on Environment and Public Works. The bill, which is similar to ACES on many
counts, is currently under consideration by several other Senate committees.
In general, effective, scientifically sound, comprehensive and cost-effective Federal climate and
energy legislation needs to include the following principles:
40



•

Establishment of aggressive science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction
requirements. Current science indicates that strong near-term limits are crucial to stabilize
and reduce emissions in the next decade. Long-term emission reductions of at least 80
percent relative to current levels are required by 2025 to avoid dangerous interference with
the climate system.

•

Ensuring the economic and environmental integrity of a Federal greenhouse gas capand-trade program. There will be strong pressure to compromise by raising the emissions
cap, allowing offset project types that cannot be credibly verified or quantified, capping
allowance price, or building in a “safety valve.” Such compromises will discourage
investments in clean energy technologies over the next decade or more, increase long-term
costs by making more aggressive and accelerated emission reductions necessary in the future,
and leave the program rightly vulnerable to charges that it is increasing costs without
significant benefits.

•

Ensuring that rigorous offset quality requirements are designed to ensure that emission
offsets represent real, verifiable, permanent emission reductions. Experience with Kyoto
Protocol offset programs, the voluntary offset markets as well as New Jersey’s open market
emission trading program for ozone precursors and CO2 has shown the potential for offset
projects to fail to produce credible emission reductions. Any offset provision in federal
legislation must include only the most robust, transparent and rigorous standards to evaluate
project eligibility and outcomes.

•

Creation of systems to distribute allowances, and use revenues from the sale of
allowances, in ways that benefit energy consumers and transforms markets. Energy
consumers bear much of the cost of allowances in a cap-and-trade program, and should
benefit from the sale or distribution of those allowances. Providing direct relief from energy
costs offers some benefit; strategically investing allowance proceeds to improve customers'
energy efficiency offers greater and longer-lived benefits. Such investments make American
businesses more competitive, create jobs immediately, stimulate new markets for renewable
energy and innovative low-carbon technologies, and reduce the cost of cutting greenhouse
gas emissions.

•

Investment in an economy-wide portfolio of approaches for reducing emissions from
uncapped sectors and for enhancing natural carbon sinks. A portfolio of complementary
policies and measures can reduce emissions from transportation, land use, waste
management, the building sector, agriculture, and smaller energy generators and industrial
emitters. The country’s green infrastructure of forests, grasslands, wetlands, and agricultural
lands play a vital role in absorbing and sequestering carbon. Protecting and enhancing these
natural sinks is an effective way to reduce emissions.

•

Facilitation of the role of the states as policy innovators by preventing federal
preemption of state programs that go beyond federal minimum requirements, as well as
preventing preemption of state programs outside the scope of federal initiatives. Given
the states’ experience in designing and implementing greenhouse gas emission reduction
programs, and their long history of environmental leadership and innovation, states must
continue to have the latitude to pursue a menu of varied and innovative approaches within
their jurisdictions.
41



•

Guidance of transmission investments toward preserving reliability of energy supplies
while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Federal actions in recent years have supported
and expedited the construction of electric transmission lines that link coal-producing regions
with population centers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Those projects are likely to spur
expanded use of existing coal-fired power plants and the development of new ones,
increasing greenhouse gas emissions and perpetuating that increase for decades to come.
Development of transmission lines to link concentrated wind resources with centers of
demand hundreds of miles away poses additional risks. When winds die down, highemitting, inefficient fossil-fueled electric generation would come online to avoid disruption
of electricity supply. Renewable resources can be integrated into the grid much more
effectively and with much less risk to reliability if they are geographically dispersed. Unless
this federal direction is decisively reversed by requiring transmission planning and siting
efforts to include analysis of how transmission projects will affect CO2 emissions, the cost of
reducing greenhouse gas emissions will grow substantially.
With its experience as a leadership state in addressing climate change, New Jersey is certain
to be highly engaged in efforts at the federal level for years to come, in developing and
implementing policies that reflect the right mix of state and federal action. New Jersey’s
leadership and early action can benefit the State economically by being poised to implement
clean energy investments that will become available under federal programs.

and Philadelphia
Recommendation #22: Explore fuel-efficient vehicle incentive programs

Electric Generation
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #1: Establish standards for fossil fuel EGUs
Implementation of this recommendation would involve a NJDEP rulemaking to establish a
minimum CO2 emissions performance standard for electric generating units (EGUs)
expressed in pounds of CO2 emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. Such a
performance standard would apply to all new fossil fuel fired EGUs and reconstructed EGUs,
including coal, oil and natural gas. Such a standard would be fuel-neutral, based on efficient
combustion of natural gas. Lower-efficiency natural gas and oil fired peaking units would be
exempt from the emissions performance standard only if such units are subject to a permit
restriction on annual electricity generation. This performance standard would be technology
forcing and would be set at a level to functionally require a level of performance
commensurate with emissions of a facility with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) or
other CO2 reducing technology for coal-fired power plants. Basing a fuel-neutral standard on
the most efficient combined cycle natural gas fired EGU would require any new or
reconstructed coal EGU to achieve minimum reductions from CCS or other CO2 reducing
technology in the range of 50 to 60 percent, or better. Thus, this technology forcing aspect of
the standard would not allow new coal fired EGU's in New Jersey unless CO2 reduction
technologies are used. Such a rulemaking would also include a requirement to review best
available technology at the time of permitting to ensure that any new or reconstructed fossil
fuel fired EGU employs the best technology to reduce GHG emissions, in addition to
meeting the baseline performance standard.
Related Action(s) with Climate Benefits:
Expand use of the Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund to incentivize cleanup
of contaminated sites for renewable energy projects
Currently, the NJBPU uses the Clean Energy Fund to help defray the cost of renewable
energy systems throughout New Jersey. These dollars can be applied to siting renewable
energy systems on properly-closed landfills. The NJDEP and the NJBPU will continue to
collaborate to promote and encourage these types of projects.
An area for which existing monies are currently not available in New Jersey is for siting
renewable energy systems on contaminated sites and brownfields. Frequently, the cost to
clean up a contaminated property is greater than the value of the property itself. Therefore,
financial incentives may be necessary to return these properties to productive use. The
44



Hazardous Discharge Site Remediation Fund (HDSRF) provides grants and loans to public
and private entities and 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations for the investigation and cleanup of
contaminated sites. Through the HDSRF, public entities can obtain up to $5 million per year
and private parties up to $1 million total for this remediation work. One incentive could be
to amend N.J.S.A. 58:10B-4 through 9 and 25 to expand the use of the HDSRF to provide
grants to counties, municipalities, or their redevelopment entities for up to 75 percent of the
cost of remediating a contaminated site if the end use of that site will be a renewable energy
project.
Expand use of the Brownfields Reimbursement Fund to incentivize renewable energy
projects on brownfield sites
Using brownfields for renewable energy projects results in the beneficial reuse of otherwise
underutilized contaminated sites. One incentive could be to expand the use of the New
Jersey Brownfield Reimbursement Fund (BRF) to provide financial incentives to build
renewable energy projects on brownfield sites. The BRF, established in 1998 in conjunction
with the Brownfield and Contaminated Site Act (N.J.S.A. 58:10B-26 through 31), allows for
the reimbursement of certain taxes, up to 75 percent of the remediation costs, that are
generated from the redevelopment of a brownfield site. This fund was created to provide the
additional incentive that is needed to make these redevelopment projects financially feasible.
Many sites may not have been selected and prioritized for cleanup, if not for the financial
incentives offered through this program. This initiative would expand the taxes eligible for
reimbursement under the BRF to allow for reimbursement of the Sales and Use tax on the
purchase of materials for the construction of renewable energy projects, up to 75 percent of
the remediation costs.
Industrial
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #2: Implement requirements for non-EGU industrial sources
The statewide GHG inventory indicates that industrial operations, including petroleum, glass,
pharmaceutical, chemical, plastic, and other manufacturing activities, significantly contribute
to statewide GHG emissions. For the industrial sector, there are several types of regulatory
options (i.e. performance standards, cap-and-trade, mandatory planning) that are available
and need to be explored to determine which would be most effective in delivering reductions
consistent with the statewide GHG limits, while maximizing market mechanisms and
operational flexibility for the business community. In addition, New Jersey must consider
interest among other states in the region for development of regulatory approaches for
industrial sectors as it weighs appropriate regional regulatory actions as well as emerging
federal policy. As a result, additional dialogue is needed with the regulated community and
other stakeholders to determine the most cost-effective regulatory strategies for reducing
industrial GHG emissions.

45



Residential/Commercial
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #3: Develop and facilitate the use of State Green Building Guidelines
for all New Residential and Commercial Buildings
The State has already begun to facilitate the use of green building design systems and these
initiatives are ongoing. A continuation of current efforts would include: building capacity in
the emerging green building industry in New Jersey, developing partnerships with the private
sector, setting green building measures for which state agencies may direct voluntary
incentives, analyzing additional public policies to foster green building practices, and
identifying additional technical and educational training opportunities. In addition, the State
is working to adopt the IECC 2009 code for the residential sector and ASHRAE 90.1-2007
for the commercial sector. This is a concrete and important incremental step toward
implementing the State’s Energy Master Plan, which recommends that new residential,
commercial and industrial construction built in 2020 use 30 percent less energy.
The NJDEP, the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (NJDCA), the NJBPU and
the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Financing Agency are working in collaboration with
the Rutgers Center for Green Building to complete and release New Jersey-specific green
building guidelines by the summer of 2010. These guidelines will provide new and existing
green building performance criteria and “how to” information to be used by applicants
seeking State agency incentives for achieving green performance. The guidelines can help
State agencies to incorporate the use of these guidelines into their existing regulatory and/or
incentive-based programs to facilitate new and existing green building programs. The
guidelines can also provide a consistent tool for use by local governments and the private
sector, and can inform green building training/education programs.
To take advantage of the expertise of individuals in New Jersey who are currently leading the
way in implementing green building practices, state agencies have already begun to consult
with technical experts in the private sector. Formalizing these interactions, perhaps through
creation of a task force, can assist the State in expanding its ongoing efforts to foster green
building practices, and respond to legislative efforts to promote green building design in New
Jersey.
Recommendation #4: Develop and facilitate a State Green Building Remodeling,
Operations and Maintenance Programs for all Existing Residential and Commercial
Buildings
In conjunction with the development of the green buildings guidelines discussed above
(which will include green guidelines for both new and existing buildings), the NJDEP, the
NJDCA, the NJBPU and the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency are
working together to develop a New Jersey Green Building Remodeling, Operations and
Maintenance Program for existing residential and commercial buildings. This program could
be applied statewide by the private sector, municipalities and individual homeowners.
As with the New Jersey-specific green building guidelines for new residential and
commercial buildings discussed above, all State agencies are identifying specific actions to
incorporate the use of these guidelines into their existing regulatory and/or incentive-based
46



programs. This will build upon existing efforts such as the NJ Green Home Remodeling
Guidelines (completed November 17, 2009; see http://www.greenbuildingrutgers.us/), as
well as the NJ Clean Energy Program’s Pay for Performance Program which takes a
comprehensive, whole-building approach to saving energy in existing commercial facilities.
Specifically, these new actions can complement Pay for Performance by considering
additional strategies for reducing energy consumption such as green design (e.g.,
landscaping, building materials, green roofs), water conservation, and on-going monitoring
of building performance followed by corrective actions. This guideline targets homeowners
and the remodeling industry to increase energy efficiency, reduce carbon footprints, improve
water conservation, minimize waste and resource use, decrease stormwater runoff, improve
indoor air quality, and provide greater support for local and sustainable building materials
and services. Further, the New Jersey’s Clean Energy program subsidizes energy audits in
the public sector for municipal buildings and facilities and in the residential sector for private
homes and provides financial incentives that support the adoption of energy efficiency
measures.
Related Action(s) with Climate Benefits:
Support statewide outdoor water use limits on lawn and landscape irrigation to
minimize consumptive water losses and water waste
Water Use and Greenhouse Gases
New Jersey already faces mounting challenges that threaten assurances of an adequate water
supply in the future. These challenges are exacerbated by the prospect of a changing climate.
While water supply planning traditionally has been conducted with an eye toward historic
conditions as a reliable guide of what to expect in the future, a warming planet and changing
hydrologic cycle may increasingly frustrate efforts to plan for and ensure sustainable water supply
yields. The reality of increasing climatic variability accents the need to develop adaptive strategies
that consist of fresh and innovative approaches to managing water supplies in the new millennium.
Eliminating water waste and improving water efficiency is the most cost-effective, least disruptive,
and environmentally sound means of reducing demands on our limited water resources.
Maximizing the use of existing supplies also reduces pumping, treatment and distribution, thereby
cutting energy consumption and resulting in further reductions in GHG emissions. Responsible
use of our water resources reduces strain on the State’s aging infrastructure and extends supplies
to ensure water availability in times of need. Demand management is a key feature of the soonto-be-released New Jersey Water Supply Plan.

The soon-to-be-released New Jersey Water Supply Plan highlights the increasing
consumption of fresh water supplies as an emerging trend that threatens water supply
availability in the Garden State. The use of high-quality water sources and treated drinking
water for non-potable purposes (such as irrigation for residential and commercial landscapes
and golf courses) unnecessarily depletes water supplies reserved for essential human and
ecological needs, especially during droughts and high-demand periods. The prospect of
global warming and the potential for warmer, drier summers accentuate the need to increase
water-use efficiency, reduce water waste, and align water quality with the intended use.
The adoption of mandatory statewide watering limits focusing on excessive irrigation of
lawns and landscapes would provide the ancillary benefit of reducing energy consumption
associated with unnecessary water pumping, treatment and distribution, thereby reducing
47



GHG emissions. Such mandatory statewide lawn and landscape watering limits would need
to be set at a level that is reasonably needed to sustain turf and plants through the institution
of an efficient irrigation regimen that is supplemental to natural precipitation and ultimately
reduces water waste.
Waste Management
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #5: Provide incentives to reduce the carbon footprint of public water
supply and wastewater treatment facilities
The State is providing favorable financing from the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure
Financing Program (NJEIFP) to local government units (such as municipal utilities
authorities) to install energy efficiency and/or GHG reduction measures at Publicly Owned
Treatment Works (POTWs) and public water supply systems. To facilitate this process, the
NJEIFP is developing protocols to provide additional priority points for projects that
incorporate measures to reduce energy usage. This also involves placing increased emphasis
on compliance with N.J.A.C. 7:22-11(d)5iii(7), which requires that all wastewater, water and
stormwater projects consider opportunities to reduce the use of energy or recover energy as
part of their facilities plan/project report.
The NJDEP can also expand the practice of using anaerobic digester gases at POTWs for
energy generation. There are existing technologies for recovery of methane that is generated
from the anaerobic digestion of wastewater treatment plant sludge, and for its use as a source
of energy for various purposes, including heating and electricity to run POTW equipment. A
USEPA report shows that 3 New Jersey POTWs have existing on-site combined heat and
power (CHP) facilities that are burning anaerobic digester gas. 66 However, the full extent of
this highly desirable practice throughout the State is not known. To assess the existing use of
CHP and other practices as well as their unutilized potential, the NJDEP is conducting a
survey of POTWs with a design flow of greater than one million gallons per day to obtain
targeted information on digester gas management, the extent to which energy recovery is
utilized, and the relevant operating conditions. The NJDEP will partner with selected
POTWs to develop and refine case studies documenting energy savings, costs and costs
savings, and GHG reductions for different operating scenarios to show that the practice can
be effectively applied across a range of POTW sizes and designs.
After completion of this study, the NJDEP will develop an education and outreach program
to inform POTWs across the State about the effectiveness and benefits of digester gas energy
recovery and to promote this practice. The NJDEP will take steps to partner with groups
representing the wastewater treatment sector, along with the NJBPU in these activities.
Recommendation #6: Implement initiatives designed to support the creation of
electricity or heat from waste sources
The key to waste management is to extract the maximum practical benefits from materials
while generating the minimum amount of waste. This is why the waste management
hierarchy, outlined below, moves from most desirable to least desirable activities:

Benefits of Combined Heat and Power at Wastewater Treatment Facilities,” April 2007.

•
•

Reduce (consume less, buy less packaging)
Reuse (thrift store, refillable bottles)
Recycle (return for deposit, curb collection)
Recover (such as waste-to-energy and fuels)
Residuals (portion that goes to landfill)

Mechanisms by which the State can “recover” waste through processes that create energy in
the form of electricity or heat from waste sources include:
•

•
•

•

Working with academia to: a) further refine assessments of New Jersey’s available
biomass resources for potential energy generation, as specified in the State’s Energy
Master Plan (EMP), to ensure consistency between interdepartmental policies such as
renewable energy goals and the recycling statute; and b) complete a Life Cycle
Assessment (LCA) of bio-energy generation systems from cellulosic parts of the waste
stream that are not otherwise designated as recyclable materials by utilizing existing
conversion technologies, such as anaerobic digestion and current thermal decomposition
technologies. The LCA assessments of these energy generation systems will address
GHG reductions related to these technologies, as well as the feedstocks identified in a)
above, and will allow the State to ascertain the GHG benefits from using these
technologies and feedstocks.
Promoting environmentally-positive waste-to-energy demonstration projects to convert
the non-recycled organic fraction of the municipal solid waste stream into renewable
electricity and/or sustainable low-carbon biofuels.
Providing guidance to support in-state sustainable low-carbon biofuels production while
addressing the ongoing waste-disposal needs of New Jersey and ensuring that all NJDEP
regulations and EMP goals are met.
Evaluating the potential for sustainable cultivation and harvesting of bio-energy crops,
with a focus on non-invasive species such as switchgrass and other short-rotation woody
crops like poplar and willow, to avoid diverting prime New Jersey farmland.

Related Action(s) with Climate Benefits:
Meet and exceed existing recycling goals to move toward a goal of zero waste
production by 2050
Major changes in the way New Jersey addresses its waste must occur if we are to meet the
State’s long-term GHG limit. The first step toward making those changes would be to
achieve New Jersey’s current statutorily-required Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) recycling
rate 67 of 50 percent, which translates into an annual GHG reduction of 8.8 MMT CO2eq
(1.67 tons CO2eq reduction for every ton of MSW recycled). 68 Exceeding the 50 percent
requirement to achieve a MSW recycling rate of 70 percent by 2020 would further contribute
significantly to the reduction of statewide GHG emissions. At a 70 percent MSW recycling
rate, the GHG reduction would be approximately 12.4 MMT CO2eq annually. The State’s
ultimate goal is zero waste production by 2050, whereby all products and packaging entering

67
68

P.L. 1992, c. 167.
2006 MSW data indicate that New Jersey documented approximately 4 million tons of recycled
materials, which represented a reduction of approximately 6.7 MMT CO2eq of GHGs.
49



the MSW stream must either be fully biodegradable, refillable or reusable a minimum
number of times, and then recyclable in an economically-sustainable manner.
To support this initiative, the NJDEP is using recycling research demonstration, education
and professional training money from the fund created by the Recycling Enhancement Act to
focus on those activities that will maximize the GHG emission reductions that can be
achieved through recycling, specifically targeting those materials in the waste stream for
which increased recycling will yield the largest GHG reductions (plastics, metals, aluminum,
and organics). These activities involve increasing the scope and efficiency of collection
systems and increasing marketing opportunities for the materials collected. Initially, the
focus will be on food waste recycling efforts.
Implement methane control mechanisms at Non-New Source Performance Standard
landfills
Landfill gas is a natural by-product of the decomposition of solid waste in landfills and is
comprised primarily of CO2 and methane. Although landfill methane emissions are falling
nationally and in New Jersey, there are still many historic landfills in New Jersey that remain
uncontrolled. Of these, approximately 20 landfills have gas collection systems with active or
passive venting and no landfill gas (LFG) control mechanism in place. The NJDEP has
determined that the landfills with venting systems already installed offer the greatest
opportunity for methane control through the use of relatively low-cost technologies. To take
advantage of the opportunity for GHG controls at these landfills, the NJDEP is developing a
State of the Art (SOTA) manual for LFG emission control which establishes the threshold
criteria for installing LFG control. Additionally, the NJDEP can propose amendments to its
rules pertaining to the design standards and construction requirements for sanitary landfill
gas collection and venting systems. Such amendments would specify that gas collection
systems may also include gas destruction mechanisms in order to reduce or eliminate
methane and other GHG emissions from landfills during closure, in those cases where gas
continues to be generated and such a system is feasible.
Use of 100-year timeframe for GWP:
The global warming potential (GWP) of a greenhouse gas is a measure of its radiative efficiency (heat
absorbing ability) relative to that of carbon dioxide (CO2) after taking into account the decay rate of
each gas (the amount removed from the atmosphere over a given number of years). GWPs allow for
a comparison of impacts of emissions and reductions of different gases.
The time horizon, or time frame, to be considered in comparing a gas with CO2 is relevant. An
analogy is an assessment of the heat given off by a smoldering fire versus the heat given off by a
firecracker. If one were to look at a time period of a few seconds after the initiation of combustion of
each, the heat given off by the firecracker would look much larger relative to that given off by the fire
than if one looked at a period of several hours. This is because a firecracker gives off heat in one
burst, whereas a smoldering fire releases heat gradually over a long period. So too, a gas that has a
relatively short lifetime in the atmosphere, while it may absorb heat strongly, will do so for only a
relatively short period of time. If a short time horizon is considered, the GWP of this short-lived gas
looks larger relative to longer-lived gases than if a longer time horizon is used. On the other hand, a
gas that may absorb heat less strongly, but does so for a much longer period, will have a relatively
higher GWP if a longer time horizon is considered. GWP values for time-periods of 20 years, 100

50



years, and 500 years have been developed and published by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, 2007, Fourth Assessment Report, Working Group One, Physical Science Basis,
Chapter 2, Table 2.14, http://www.ipcc.ch).
The State has used GWPs based on a 100-year time horizon. This is consistent with other
inventory and reduction efforts throughout the world. As noted by the USEPA, (USEPA, 2008,
Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2007,
http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usgginventory.html) the parties of the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have agreed to use GWPs based upon a
100-year time horizon. This horizon represents a compromise between the long (500 year) and
short (20 year) time horizons. Choice of this time horizon lessens the possibility of
undervaluing what is arguably the most important and difficult to control greenhouse gas, CO2,
relative to the shorter-lived greenhouse gas methane, as would be the case if a 20-year horizon
was used.

Non-CO2 Highly Warming Gases
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #7: Monitor the development of other states’ actions to reduce nonCO2 highly warming gases and consider if they are appropriate to be implemented in
New Jersey
Like New Jersey, many states are now developing their GHG mitigation plans. Part of that
focus is to determine strategies to reduce and control releases of the non-CO2 highly warming
gases. For example, the California Air Resources Board is currently developing reduction
strategies in 13 different sectors and subsectors to reduce emissions of gases with high global
warming potential (GWP) from stationary and mobile sources. The NJDEP will monitor the
development of other states’ actions and will consider whether they are appropriate for
implementation in New Jersey.
Recommendation #8: Broaden the scope of building codes to address high GWP gases
In conjunction with modifications to New Jersey’s building codes to foster greater energy
efficiency, the State is developing requirements through the DCA Uniform Construction
Code rules that new building Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems be
designed to minimize or eliminate use of ozone-depleting substances and replacement
substances, including HFCs.
Recommendation #9: Add high GWP gas requirements for HVAC contractors
The following actions will help to strengthen existing programs pertaining to professional
HVAC contractors:
•

•

Establish a State Board of Examiners of Heating, Ventilating, Air Conditioning and
Refrigeration (HVACR) Contractors and require licensure through this Board in order to
work as a Master HVACR Contractor in the State. Any rules or regulations adopted by
this Board will consider proper management of chlorofluorocarbons and other
refrigerants, including high-GWP gases.
Add a continuing education requirement covering high-GWP gases to the new licensing
requirements for HVACR contractors.
51



•

Seek a legislative amendment to allow only licensed HVACR contractors or licensed
plumbers to purchase any high-GWP refrigerants.

Recommendation #10: Institute a Leak Detection and Repair program for high-GWP
gases from commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment
To complement other high-GWP gas recommendations outlined above, the NJDEP could
develop a Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) regulatory program for high-GWP gases used
in commercial and industrial refrigeration equipment that exceeds a designated threshold
size. Such a regulation would extend many of the current federal requirements for Ozone
Depleting Substances (ODSs) under Title VI of the Clean Air Act to cover
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used as replacements for ODSs but are currently not
regulated under Title VI.
Recommendation #11: Reduce HFC emissions from the do-it-yourself servicing of
motor vehicle air conditioning systems
The current automotive refrigerant HFC-134a, commonly known as R-134a, is a highly
potent GHG with a global warming impact 1,300 times greater than CO2. The GWP of the
refrigerant in a single 12-ounce container is equivalent to 1,000 lbs of CO2, or the emissions
from an automobile burning 50 gallons of gasoline. Regulating small containers that hold
between 2 ounces and 2 pounds of automotive refrigerant with a GWP greater than 150
would be consistent with the approach taken by the California Air Resources Board.
Terrestrial Sequestration
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #12: Require State-funded projects to comply with the no net loss
goal of forested area and tree replacement provisions of the “No Net Loss Act"
Currently, any State entity, such as a department, agency or office of State government or
State university or college, is subject to compensatory reforestation requirements under the
“No Net Loss Act” (N.J.S.A. 13:1L-14.2 et seq.) if it is going to deforest an area on property
it owns or maintains that is at least one-half acre in size. Extending the same requirements to
any State-funded project resulting in the same level of impact would ensure that State-funded
projects account for lost carbon storage and sequestration capacity, as well as increased GHG
emissions due to deforestation, while providing for the necessary lag time for tree growth to
meet the 2020 statewide GHG limit. Based on estimated energy consumption, the GHG
emissions of State government (excluding counties and municipalities) amount to more than
800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent annually. 69 The carbon sequestered and stored in trees
preserved through the strict implementation and expanded application of the “No Net Loss
Act” would help offset some portion of these CO2 emissions.

Recommendation #13: Establish legislation, develop policies (e.g. financing via GSPT)
or implement through existing programs (e.g., re-adoption of the stormwater rules) onsite tree preservation percentage requirements for new development consistent with
tree canopy target recommendations of American Forests (formerly the American
Forest Association)
As the most densely populated and highly urbanized state in the nation, New Jersey faces the
constant threat of development consuming its remaining open land. Nationwide, urban areas
have increased in size by about 20 percent in the last decade, while over the same period,
urban tree cover has declined by about 30 percent. 70 Existing trees in urban as well as other
areas maintain the State’s green infrastructure and associated ecosystem services, including
carbon storage and sequestration. Establishment of municipal tree canopy goals or
requirements would drive design of development or maintenance projects to consider tree
cover. American Forests recommends an average goal of 40 percent tree cover for
Northeastern cities 71 . This percentage is an average for the entire Northeast metropolitan
area. It is made up of 50 percent tree cover in suburban areas, 25 percent tree cover in urban
residential areas, and 15 percent tree cover in the central business district. 72 These tree cover
targets could be translated into on-site tree preservation requirements for each parcel of new
development through new legislation or implemented as part of existing regulations such as
the stormwater management rules. The Coastal Zone Management Rules (N.J.A.C. 7:7E5A.10 and 7:7E- B.5) already have these tree preservation/planting percentage requirements
for the coastal region. These requirements are consistent with the American Forests target
tree cover goals. It would be technically feasible to extend the application of similar
requirements statewide such that development in all areas, including those that are not
considered environmentally sensitive, are subject to tree preservation standards.
Recommendation #14: Develop Agricultural Best Management Practices to address
energy efficiency, renewable energy and the release of GHGs in agricultural operations
and structures
By purchasing food grown or produced locally, consumers reduce the number of “food
miles” needed to bring the food from farm to fork. While reducing food miles will result in
GHG reductions, the energy required to grow produce locally, especially out of season, needs
to be evaluated to ensure that there is a net benefit in terms of GHG reductions overall.
Therefore, to reduce the GHG emissions associated with agricultural production, the State
can work to develop Agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) to address energy
efficiency and the use of renewable energy in agricultural operations and structures. Such
BMPs would include criteria for the siting of new structures on land areas that have been
previously disturbed to prevent the release of GHGs associated with soil disturbance or
prevent the loss of forested areas that sequester carbon. Opportunities exist for harmonizing
these objectives with Federal partners and funds through energy and related provisions in the
2008 Farm Bill.

The State can also support research into the various ways greenhouses and other appropriate
structures can be operated in an energy-efficient manner, in order to extend the growing
season for locally grown foods without increasing carbon emissions or having any other
negative impacts on natural resources. Such efforts would need to include the study of
appropriate design parameters and siting criteria for “urban” greenhouses.
In addition to creating these new Agricultural BMPs, the State continues to support and
promote, through programs like Jersey Fresh, the purchase of in-season food grown locally,
in an energy efficient manner. The State will continue establishing linkages between New
Jersey farmers and nearby food processors to maximize energy savings and reduce the travel
distance of produce intended for food-processing operations as well as expand outreach to
consumers on the GHG benefits of locally-grown and locally-processed food.
Related Action(s) with Climate Benefits:
Explore the development of a statewide conservation restriction registry
Conservation restrictions are important components of New Jersey’s land preservation and
stewardship efforts. The term “conservation restriction” can include conservation easements,
deed restrictions and other legally-binding limitations imposed on land in order to limit
certain types of uses or development of a property while preserving in perpetuity one or more
of its natural attributes. Conservation easements are held by nonprofit or government
entities, which are responsible for ensuring their stewardship and enforcing the restrictions,
but the remainder of the underlying property interest continues to be held by private property
owners. In New Jersey, conservation restrictions can also be created by regulatory bodies, as
well as held by county and local governments, most often as a result of planning or zoning
decisions.
Although conservation restrictions are most often memorialized as part of deeds or other
documents filed with the appropriate county clerks, subsequent purchasers are often not wellinformed about their details or significance. Moreover, in New Jersey there is no centralized
source of information that can be accessed by members of the public or government officials
interested in determining either the extent of easements in a community or whether an
individual property is subject to a conservation easement. As a result, lack of monitoring,
enforcement and even knowledge of the existence of individual easements has been reported
in various parts of the country, including New Jersey 73 .
With the implementation of the RGGI carbon offset program, afforestation projects of the
type recommended in this Report will undoubtedly be proposed throughout the region. An
important planning tool for identifying potential areas of afforestation, as well as vetting
specific properties as appropriate for afforestation and not in conflict with other limitations,
would be a geospatial registry of tax parcels linked to deed restrictions already in place.
Establishment of a central registry would allow the State to establish a terrestrial carbon
sequestration baseline for New Jersey which, in turn, will help facilitate project development,
as well as enforcement.

Continue to preserve, expand and restore New Jersey's green infrastructure
The State's land and cultural assets constitute a valuable infrastructure, as much as highways
and bridges, and as such require a recurring, broad-based investment in stewardship. This
"green" infrastructure (of forests, meadows, watersheds and wildlife habitats, freshwater
wetlands and tidal marshes, working farms and agricultural landscapes) has an even more
vital role than physical infrastructure in that it provides essential ecosystem services
including climate regulation and carbon storage and sequestration.
Since 1961, New Jersey has been a leader in open space preservation, using public funding
provided by a series of voter-approved bond acts. The Garden State Preservation Trust
(GSPT) is the current open space financing authority, using several rounds of funding
approval since 1998. Since its inception, the GSPT has created momentum in conservation
by using its funds to provide the incentive for local government, regional and non-profit
agencies to raise money for preservation through local open space taxes and other means. As
a result of the combined efforts of the State, counties, municipalities and nonprofit land
conservation organizations over the last 50 years, conserved land (e.g., forests, parks, wildlife
refuges, preserved farms) totals an estimated 1.4 million acres - one third of New Jersey's dry
land mass. These lands embody a substantial amount of carbon storage. The United State
Department of Agriculture estimates that New Jersey forests alone store about 304 million
metric tons of CO2eq. 74
Wetlands provide carbon storage and sequestration services, as well as mitigate against
flooding caused by storms. A combined 1,000,000 acres of tidal and freshwater wetlands in
New Jersey necessitate continued conservation, protection and restoration. These wetlands
have considerable carbon storage potential (probably in the order of at least 60 million tons
of carbon or 220 million tons CO2eq in soil and biomass). 75 An important area for wetland
restoration in New Jersey is restoration of Atlantic White Cedar forests with 42,000 acres
recommended for restoration by a New Jersey Forest Service commissioned study 76 . Such
wooded wetlands have high growth potential and therefore significant sequestration
potential. Also promising for high carbon storage are the lesser recognized saline tidal
marshes (approximately 163,000 acres) that may contain large amounts of CO2 deep in the
ground beneath the marshes. 77 These types of wetlands are highly effective in sequestering
carbon as they release only negligible amounts of the other GHGs, methane and nitrous
oxide, compared to that released by freshwater marshes. This important attribute of the tidal

and the U.S. Climate Change Program both recommend wetlands protection and restoration
as a strategy to sequester CO2. 78
County governments, municipalities and non-profit preservation trusts have leveraged GSPT
funds to preserve acreage two or three times faster than land is being lost to development.
Continuing to preserve and expand its existing green infrastructure network by assisting local
and regional entities with open space and greenway creation through incentives, technical
support, and project coordination and facilitation, is an important element of the State’s
efforts to sequester carbon. This includes protection and restoration of natural wetlands,
including Atlantic White Cedar restoration projects as well as maintaining tidal marshes, to
avoid release of CO2 and methane in large quantities. On November 3, 2009 New Jersey
voters approved the issuance of $400 million in State bonds to continue the legacy of the
GSPT.
Work with the State Legislature to pass, and then comply with, amendments to the New
Jersey Forest Stewardship legislation to ensure private forestlands remain under forest
cover according to sustainable forestry practices
Instead of encouraging landowners to cut trees just to meet an income requirement, as under
the current woodland management program, the regulatory incentives provided under the
New Jersey Forest Stewardship legislation (Senate bill #713(SCS)) and the appropriate
carbon credit economic opportunities would induce private landowners to keep their
forestlands under continuous forest production or protection. If sustainable forestry (within
the framework of a forest stewardship plan mandated by Senate bill #713(SCS)) is practiced
to yield more significant co-benefits, such as watershed and biodiversity habitat protection,
the incentives are amplified as other ecosystem service payments come into play. Improved
management can accelerate growth rates in some situations, add trees to understocked forest
sites, extend rotations to increase standing biomass, and maintain existing carbon stocks
where forests might be cleared for other land uses. Forest products are potentially carbon
creditable, as these can be linked to a sustainable forest management certification system
specified in the legislation. Carbon benefit of full forest stocking would range from 2 to 10
tons of CO2eq per acre per year. 79 Almost a million acres of private forest lands could
potentially be involved in this program. 80
GHG Emissions, Agriculture, and the Food Systems
The food system, which includes production, processing, shipping, storage, and preparation of food,
accounts for about 10 percent of U.S. total energy consumption. In addition, agriculture is associated
with a significant portion of emissions of methane (3 percent) and nitrous oxide (4 percent), both
potent GHGs. So, at least 10 percent of the CO2eq GHG emissions that a typical U.S. resident is
directly and indirectly responsible for, (his or her “carbon footprint,”) is associated with food in some
way.

78

Accordingly, the NJ Global Warming Solutions Fund Act also includes a 10 percent RGGI allocation
for forest stewardship and tidal marshes.

Tracing the energy inputs associated with foods, and adapting the information to regions such as New
Jersey, is complicated and challenging due to data limitations and uncertainties. However, according
to several studies, about 20 percent of the energy used by the food system is used for agricultural
production, 25 percent to 30 percent is used for household storage and preparation, 10 to 15 percent
is used for transportation, and the remainder is used by processing, marketing and restaurants.

Food System: A Summary of Existing Research and Analysis, Sustainable Farming, Vol. 7, No 4, 1997
and references therein)
Within the agriculture sector, production of meats and other animal products consumes anywhere from
two to greater than ten times as much energy as the production of grains, fruits, and vegetables (Smil,
Vaclav, 1991, General Energetics, John Wiley & Sons, NY). Raising meat animals in confined feeding
operations, e.g. feedlots, is more energy-intensive than pasture-based production (Note: New Jersey
is well below the national average in proportion of agricultural production that is a confined animal feed
operation). The energy-intensive nature of meat production is reflected in relatively high GHG
emissions from the production of red meat and dairy products when compared with other foods. A
dietary shift away from such foods can in general be a more effective means of lowering an average
household’s food-related GHG footprint in favor of buying locally-grown food (Weber, Christopher and
H. Scott Matthews, 2008, Food-miles and the relative climate impacts of food choices in the United
States, Environ. Sci. Technol., 42, 3508-3513).
It is important to consider the concept of "food miles," which is the distance food travels from where it
is grown or raised to where it is purchased by the consumer or end-user. In industrialized nations like
the U.S., food miles have increased significantly in the last 50 years. (Pirog, 2005. "Energy efficiency
as an integral part of sustainable agriculture: food miles and fuel usage in food transport."
Presentation at the ACEEE Forum on Energy Efficiency in Agriculture. November 16, 2005). To cite
just one example, in California more than 485,000 truckloads of fresh fruits and vegetables travel 100
to 3,100 miles to reach their destinations (Hagen, J.W. et al, 1999. "California's produce trucking
industry: characteristics and important issues). Considering the impact of food miles on fossil fuel
consumption, developing or redeveloping a local or regional food system may help reduce fuel use
and GHG emissions from food transport. However, it may be useful to bear in mind certain limitations
when using the concept of food miles. First, higher food miles for certain foods do not always translate
into higher energy use, such as when the food items are shipped by boat, barge or train instead of
airplanes or trucks. Second, there is a need to apply life cycle analysis to agricultural products. Third,
local foods grown in greenhouses might use more energy than foods grown in open fields and
transported across the U.S. (Some of the referenced greenhouse data in the following discussion are
based on climates colder than New Jersey, and may not reflect state-of-the-art technology.)
It is likely that eating a higher portion of locally-grown, fresh or relatively unprocessed grains, bean and
vegetables, and less meat and processed foods will lower a person's food carbon footprint. Eating
greenhouse grown fruits and vegetables out-of-season is likely to have the opposite effect, because
heated greenhouse agriculture is energy-intensive. Growing vegetables in the field is estimated to
consume between 25,000 and 100,000 megajoules (MJ) of energy per hectare, which translates to an
energy input of approximately 1 or 2 MJ/kg; their refrigeration or preserving adds about 3 MJ/kg (Smil,
1991). Out-of-season greenhouse grown vegetables require considerably more energy input; in the
range of 30 MJ to 40 MJ per kilogram of vegetable (Carlsson-Kanyama, Annika and Mireille Faist,

Switzerland, downloaded 10/10/07 http://www.infra.kth.se/fms/pdf/energyuse.pdf; Barber, Andrew,

Available data indicate that heated greenhouse-based production is much more energy-intensive than
other aspects of the food system, including transportation, which makes a relatively modest
contribution to the energy footprint of most foods. Transportation’s contribution is described by Weber
and Matthews in the article referenced above. According to this study, trucks consume about 2.7
MJ/ton-km and trains consume about 0.3 MJ/ton-km. So, trucking produce from California (~4800 km)
would add about 13 MJ/kg to total for a food item, and trucking from Florida (~1600 km) would add
about 5 MJ/km. Train shipment, even from California, would add only about 1.5 MJ/km. Substituting
locally-grown out-of-season greenhouse crops for similar items imported from elsewhere in the nation
or region is unlikely to reduce the size of the energy or greenhouse gas footprint associated with food,
and may increase the size of the footprint considerably.

Implement farming and forestry practice recommendations to reduce GHG emissions
The State can implement a number of farming and forestry-related actions that will reduce
energy usage, minimize the release of GHGs from soil tillage and other agricultural
operations, and protect and promote natural carbon storage sinks. These include the
following:
•

•

•

Encouraging, where practical, minimum tillage/no tillage/conservation tillage farming:
These methods minimize energy use in plowing, harrowing and cultivating of fields,
resulting in significant energy savings. There is need to investigate options in the 2008
Farm Bill for funding these methods.
For conventional tillage methods, ensuring that farmers plant cover crops during the
winter: With the diverse cropping situations located throughout New Jersey, certain
cropping practices will still require the use of conventional tillage. Planting harvested
land with a grass or legume cover over during the winter preserves residue in the soil and
thus stores additional carbon at relatively low cost. Cropland would benefit from
cultivation of winter cover crops. Winter cover crops reduce erosion, nitrate leaching and
fertilizer use during the summer growing season, making it a relatively cost-effective
option. However, in order to sustain this type of practice, maintain healthy soils and
increase the ability of the soil to retain nutrients, the implementation of a cost share
program is essential. Through the efforts of the agricultural organizations in the State,
options will be investigated and developed to cover the costs of the cost share programs,
including the 2008 Farm Bill provisions.
Harmonizing the 2008 Farm Bill and New Jersey statewide GHG limits: Investigate
modifications to Soil and Water Conservation and Farm Bill program practices and
funding priorities to align funded practices with the State's overall GHG limits. The New
Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA) will work with appropriate State and federal
partners to target Soil and Water Conservation funds provided through the 2008 Farm
Bill to programs and practices that achieve measurable success in reducing GHGs. The
2008 Farm Bill includes, for the first time, an Energy Title and thus creates the
opportunity to integrate related GHG mitigation criteria. The NJDA will also work with
appropriate State and federal partners to target any funds provided through the 2008 Farm
Bill Energy Title and other relevant Titles toward programs and practices that achieve
reduction of GHGs. This includes work with the Natural Resources Conservation
Service to review the Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) for New Jersey with the end
view of including a conservation practice standard for agricultural farming practices that
reduce GHG emissions as well as enhance carbon sequestration. To the extent
practicable, the FOTGs developed should cover all the counties of the State. Practices
included in the FOTGs are incorporated in the Farm Conservation Plan that is required
when farmers apply for funding and other incentives under the 2008 Farm Bill.
58

•

Providing demonstration and education programs for farmers on, and encourage the use
of, methane abatement processes from livestock waste and techniques for managing
nutrients back to the farmlands from livestock waste: The agricultural industry has the
unique capability to utilize farm-generated manure to stabilize anaerobic production of
methane gas for energy. The waste streams from anaerobic methane gas production
include treated effluents that can be discharged into the environment with little or no
adverse effect while solid nutrient streams (biosolids) of nitrogen, phosphorous, and
potassium can be used as a locally produced commercial fertilizer. The development of
multiple waste-source-supply anaerobic methane gas production sites would enhance the
economy of scale, waste disposal, and nutrient management while providing alternative
energy production and sustainability of multiple industries. The NJDA will take the lead
to develop demonstration sites and oversee the education program for the agricultural
industry.
Investigating the feasibility of encouraging farmers to utilize certain fertilizer application
methods which reduce the release of nitrous oxide: Practices aimed at conserving carbon
affect emissions of other GHGs. Of critical importance is the interaction of carbon
sequestration with N2O emissions, because N2O is such a potent GHG. In certain
conditions, carbon sequestration practices, such as reduced tillage, can stimulate N2O
emissions thus offsetting part of the benefit; in other situations, carbon-conserving
practices may suppress N2O emissions, amplifying the net benefit.
Managing overabundant deer population that impact forest regeneration and
consequently forest carbon sequestration: The proliferation of deer in the state has
become a critical problem not only affecting agriculture and accelerating invasion of
exotic species but threatening the establishment of new forests as well as the capacity of
existing forests to regenerate, remain healthy, and continue to sequester carbon. Support
will be provided to on-going initiatives and the adoption of legislation to expand hunting
and further develop mechanisms to control overabundant populations of deer that would
affect forest regeneration and health and impact the success of afforestation for GHG
sequestration and emissions reduction; expand statute to include forests, to allow forest
land owners to qualify for depredation permits, in addition to cultivated agricultural crops
for areas where action can take place to reduce deer damage.

Transportation and Land Use
Today’s travel patterns, both in New Jersey and nationally, raise serious problems related to
increasing GHG emissions and other air contaminants. Too large a share of travel is done in
single-occupancy automobiles, a relatively costly and inefficient mode. Too much “travel” time
is spent by people sitting in traffic jams. Too many trips are carried out by people getting into a
car to buy a quart of milk or a newspaper because they have no shops within walking or biking
distance. Too many people are forced by limited housing options to live further and farther away
from their jobs and social connections without access to viable automobile alternatives (e.g., cost
effective and convenient mass transit), leading to long travel hours spent away from their homes
and families. Too much of our goods and products are transported via conventionally-fueled
trucks. Our vehicles – the mainstay of our travel and product transport – could be more fuel
efficient. The conventional fuels used to power our vehicles today (primarily, gasoline and
diesel fuels) are highly carbon intensive. Addressing these pivotal issues will have a direct and
tangible impact on GHG emissions.
As shown by Figure 3.1, if nothing is done to change current trends, transportation-related
petroleum usage is projected to increase from approximately 130 million barrels of gasoline and
59



diesel fuel in 2004 to approximately 160 million barrels in 2020 – an approximate increase of 30
million barrels.

applied to the base year)

Many states that have been leading efforts in the U.S. to address climate change are now
considering how to best relate statewide GHG limits to the transportation sector. 81 Like these
states, New Jersey realizes that establishing some form of clear, measurable and enforceable
GHG limits on the transportation sector would provide certainty for transportation sector GHG
reductions over time. New Jersey’s 2020 statewide GHG limit equals approximately a 20
percent reduction below estimated 2020 business-as-usual (BAU) emissions. Applying that
degree of reduction to the on-road portion of the transportation sector would translate into
holding emissions to approximately 40 MMT per year. Setting the transportation sector GHG
limit at this level would result in reductions similar to those that would be achieved by applying
the EMP goal of reducing New Jersey’s overall projected energy consumption by 20 percent by
2020 to the transportation sector (approximately 12 to 15 MMT of CO2eq).
Improving the sustainability of our transportation system, and reducing GHG emissions, will be
a long-term effort requiring many measures and steps. In general, the future vision for a more
sustainable transportation system can be guided by the following principles:
•
•

81

People will have a wide variety of attractive, sustainable travel options, including walking,
biking, ridesharing, and mass transit.
Goods and products will be transported in the most efficient and environmentally sound
manner practical.
Emissions from on-road gasoline vehicles, on-road diesel vehicles, aviation, marine vessels, and railroad
and other transportation sources totaled approximately 49 MMT tons of CO2eq in 2004. These five
subcategories of transportation combined contributed approximately 35 percent of the gross New Jersey
GHG emissions in 2004. A subset of the total transportation sector, on-road gasoline and diesel
emissions, is estimated to be approximately 46 MMT tons in 2004 and approximately 50 MMT in 2007.
60

People will be able to live and work in well-designed, compact, sustainable, walkable,
transit-friendly communities.
People will be rewarded for choosing efficient travel modes.
Technology (associated with the vehicles themselves and supporting infrastructure) will
dramatically reduce the carbon footprint of high-energy travel modes.
Market-based standards will drive innovation to produce fuel alternatives that are carbon
neutral or less carbon intensive than existing options.
Transportation financing mechanisms will support sustainable transportation by making it
more cost effective to drive highly efficient vehicles and to reduce vehicle miles traveled.
Transportation Choices 2030 New Jersey’s Long-Range Transportation Plan
In 2030 advanced technology and changes in land use have made transportation in New Jersey more
convenient and efficient than ever before, sustaining the state’s strong economy and high quality of
life. Public transportation is available to most destinations for those who don’t have cars or choose not
to drive. While congestion has not been completely eliminated from the state’s roadways, highway
travel is less frustrating and more reliable. Energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions have
been significantly reduced since 2009.
In response to the enormous increase in the amount of freight moving through and within the state, the
use of rail has been optimized, non-rush hour movements have increased, capacity along key truck
corridors has been maintained and land use supports efficient freight distribution.
Highways in New Jersey are now “smart highways” that use ultra wideband radar transponders built
into the highway that communicate with sensors, receivers, and processors installed in cars and
trucks. The resulting cooperation between the highway and vehicle is now controlling many driving
functions like steering, spacing between vehicles and speed. This technology is ensuring safety
through measures like collision avoidance and is adding to highway capacity because more vehicles
can be accommodated per lane.
Public transportation has become an even more welcome alternative to driving. The multimodal,
integrated transit network is seamless and borderless to the people who use it; travelers can move
from one system to another at convenient transportation hubs where rail, bus, ferry and local
community service options are available. Using a regional smart fare card for all travel needs,
including parking, transit, transfers and tolls, makes all travel easier for everyone.
Taking public transit to work and school, to shop, to attend to daily needs and to visit with friends and
family takes less time than it did in 2009. New passenger rail tunnels under the Hudson River have
made travel between New Jersey and New York City faster and more direct and have enabled new
services and increases in service throughout the rail system. Buses can move at the speed limit on
heavily traveled corridors at all times, and light rail is available to many in areas where growth policies
have led to concentrated, transit-friendly developments.
Given a wealth of travel options and changes in land development patterns, New Jersey’s citizens
make fewer and shorter trips by car. A greater awareness of the implications of how they travel has
led many to eliminate some trips through measures like compressed work weeks and
teleconferencing, and to replace some car trips by walking and bicycling. Travel is particularly
improved for people who have chosen to live in the numerous locations throughout the state where
housing, schools and businesses are clustered together. These centers, created by local ordinances,
make providing and maintaining infrastructure more cost effective. They also support transit, shorten
or eliminate many auto trips and preserve precious open space. Neighborhood stores like cleaners,
delis, and pharmacies are nearby, within a short and safe walk or bicycle trip.
New technologies and dependable, adequate funding sources for capital, operating and maintenance
needs ensure the transportation system remains safe and in a state of good repair.

61



Efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector have largely focused on increasing
the efficiency of vehicles themselves (e.g., continued implementation of the State’s LEV
program) and reducing the carbon intensity of fuels (e.g., regional implementation of a Low
Carbon Fuel Standard). However, in order to meet both the 2020 and 2050 limit, New Jersey
needs to also turn its attention to other aspects of the transportation sector, namely stabilizing the
annual growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and expanding opportunities for New Jerseyeans
to enjoy a high standard of living that is less automobile-dependent. New Jersey’s efforts to
aggressively develop and implement transportation and land use policies and initiatives to
support attainment of the State’s 2020 statewide GHG limits and set New Jersey on the path to
attaining the 2050 statewide GHG limits need to focus on the following seven areas:
1. FACILITATE WIDESPREAD USE OF LOW AND ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES
Encouraging the purchase and use of low and zero emission vehicles, while simultaneously
ensuring that New Jersey has an infrastructure that enables widespread use of these vehicles,
will help ensure ubiquitous and rapid deployment of new vehicle technologies and business
models in New Jersey. The deployment of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) 82 , as well as some
of the other low carbon fuel alternatives technologies, includes the need for both direct
infrastructure (related to fueling and servicing the vehicles themselves) and support
infrastructure (related to fuel generation and distribution). Many potential combinations of
technologies and business models are possible in this emerging field. State policy should
seek to enable the widest possible array of potential combinations, while at the same time not
creating an advantage for any single technology or business model. Specifically, New Jersey
recommends the following for this area:
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #15: Determine needs for implementing infrastructure alternatives
to conventional motor vehicle fuels (i.e., gasoline and diesel) in New Jersey
In order to meet the 2020 statewide GHG limit, New Jersey’s portfolio of actions will need to
include changes to the nature of vehicles we drive and the fuels used to power those vehicles.
Other recommendations in this report address ways in which New Jersey will provide
incentives for the purchase of cleaner and more efficient vehicles and establish standards for
low carbon fuels in the transportation sector. In addition to these efforts, it is critical that the
State consider what is needed from an infrastructure perspective to support a new generation
of clean vehicles. Such consideration needs to address regulatory updates (e.g.,
modifications to building codes and standards to allow for plug-in devices), legislation, and
funding (e.g., securing federal grant monies), as well as other technical considerations. To
begin this process, the State could convene a multi-disciplinary task force to examine these
issues and to develop a plan outlining the actions necessary to ensure infrastructure to
support alternatively-fueled vehicles 83 , consistent with standards established under a Low
Carbon Fuel Standard. Such a task force would benefit from membership including both
public and private sector participants, including, but not limited to, representatives from all
relevant State agencies, as well as representatives from conventional and alternative-fueled
automotive manufacturers, auto retailers and public utilities.
82

83

ZEV technologies generally include electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, provided that fuel
supplies are created using non-polluting sources and technologies.

For the purposes of this report, alternative fuels include CNG, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, electricity and sustainablyderived biofuels.
62



Recommendation #16: Implement transportation-related initiatives and demonstration
projects
In order to meet the State’s long term GHG limit, major structural changes need to occur to
the New Jersey’s transportation infrastructure to support alternative vehicles and fuels and to
promote alternative transportation modes. New Jersey is committed to being a national
leader by transforming its transportation infrastructure to one that not only supports, but that
also promotes, the use of alternative fuels including electrification for cars and compressed
natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and/or hydrogen for fleets. This commitment
necessitates immediate identification of resources and strategies to begin implementation of
this transformation today.
The first steps toward implementing the necessary structural changes is determining which
will work in New Jersey, and generating support for these new ideas with the public. The
most productive way to do this is through demonstration projects. These projects will give
the State the opportunity to determine the feasibility and acceptability of various structural
changes, before committing significant State resources. In addition, these demonstration
projects will provide an opportunity for the NJBPU to assess the expected infiltration of
alternatively-fueled vehicles to the overall fleet, and the implication of that growing
percentage on non-liquid fuel and electricity needs of the State. Finally, the data from these
demonstrations will support the work of the multi-disciplinary task force discussed in the
previous recommendation.
As part of this recommendation, the following projects are identified as being ripe for shortterm implementation:
Supporting the introduction of electric vehicles – Given that several major automobile
manufacturers plan to introduce electric vehicles into the marketplace over the next several
years (the 2010 to 2012 model years), the State can work in partnership with utilities,
communities and the private sector to undertake initiatives that provide infrastructure that
accelerates the introduction and use of those vehicles in New Jersey. As part of these
initiatives, an evaluation of the use of “smart charging” strategies, such as the use of smart
meters and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technologies, could also help provide valuable information
to the NJBPU and the State’s electric utilities. This recommendation may be coordinated
with the New Jersey Transit’s "Green Corridors" Program, which includes the development
of infrastructure for plug-in electric hybrid vehicles at such locations as commuter park-andride lots.
Demonstrating various alternative transportation fuels for urban fleet use - Urban fleet
vehicles traditionally run on diesel fuel, a high-carbon fuel with attendant criteria pollutant
emissions, such as particulate matter. The State can develop a partnership with in-state lowcarbon fuel producers to use sustainable biofuels produced from energy crops or food wastebased feedstock, compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas technology utilizing landfill
gas, and renewable hydrogen for fleet use, to reduce GHG and criteria pollutant emissions in
New Jersey's densely populated urban centers. Urban delivery vehicles, waste hauling
vehicles, and locomotives will be specifically targeted for fuel switching in this
demonstration project.

63



“Green” the State-owned fleet - The State of New Jersey has a fleet of over 14,000 vehicles
that support State operations. Gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles represent 23 percent of the
State government's total energy consumption in British Thermal Unit (BTU) value. The
State Director of Energy Savings has outlined a comprehensive strategy for reducing fleet
petroleum consumption and GHG emissions by 25 percent by 2020. This strategy includes:
1) reducing fleet size by retiring the older and inefficient vehicles; 2) increasing use of
higher-efficiency vehicles, including hybrids; 3) right-sizing vehicle replacements to
purchase the most fuel-efficient vehicles for the intended use; 4) increasing use of alternative
fuels such as sustainably-derived biodiesel; 5) establishing a green driving policy to require
fuel-efficient vehicle operation and maintenance; and 6) deploying new fuel monitoring
technologies that will track vehicle fuel consumption, miles traveled and efficiency. One
approach could be to establish a policy directive and strategy to achieve a mile per gallon
average fuel efficiency standard for new state car purchases by 2016. Such a policy could
raise efficiency standards for vehicles on state contract and establish requirements for state
agency vehicle purchases.
2. REQUIRE INCREASING QUANTITIES OF LOW-CARBON FUELS
New Jersey is working with 10 other states in the region through the Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), as well as with the State of California, to
develop a regional approach to establish a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS). A LCFS is
intended to reduce the carbon-intensity of transportation fuels through a performance-based
standard that optimizes cost-effectiveness, but does not mandate any specific fuel or
technology. Under a LCFS, fuel providers would be required to track the carbon intensity of
their transportation fuel products and meet, on average, a standard for GHG emissions which
declines over time. The carbon intensity for each fuel type is measured on a CO2eq per unit
of energy basis and is a measure of all of the factors that affect GHG emissions, including
lifecycle GHG emissions from the production and use of the fuel (including land use and
agricultural elements) and the efficiencies of different vehicle engine types. For example,
carbon intensity values account for the higher efficiency of the electric engine versus the
internal combustion engine. The LCFS would require an overall reduction of carbon
intensity over time. California is targeting a 10 percent reduction in carbon intensity by
2020, and estimates that reductions of 60-70 percent will be needed to meet their 2050 GHG
reduction goal. 84 The LCFS would be complemented by a credit-trading program in which
fuel providers may meet the standard in the most cost-effective manner. The credit trading
system would be open to any provider of fuel used for transportation purposes, including
electric utilities that provide electricity for use in plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles.
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #17: Develop and implement a Low Carbon Fuel Standard through a
multi-state effort
The NJDEP continues to be active in the regional effort to develop and implement a LCFS
and will assess regulatory approaches for implementing such a standard in New Jersey.

3. TRANSITION TO LOW-CARBON METHODS OF GOODS MOVEMENT
To increase understanding of the goods movement issues, constraints, and opportunities
facing the State now and in the future, the New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) has completed the first Comprehensive Statewide Freight Plan. This plan:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Described the goods movement transportation network in New Jersey from a physical,
operational, economic, and citizen's perspective.
Produced a synthesis of previous work and outreach highlighting issues, trends,
challenges and opportunities in goods movement in New Jersey.
Identified, evaluated and recommended alternative options and policies that address
constraints by mode.
Increased public understanding of goods movement and logistics issues.
Developed better tools and performance measures to evaluate freight issues and options.
Strengthened partnerships and coordination with sister transportation agencies, other
government organizations, private industry and the public.

Investigate opportunities for rail shuttle operations
The State will continue to investigate opportunities in New Jersey for rail shuttle
operations, which would move freight by rail rather than by truck. Rail shuttle projects
would use short-line railroads to move freight from Port Newark/Port Elizabeth to inland
freight centers, where it could be processed through value-added operations, re-sorted,
and sent out via truck or long-haul rail. Moving goods by rail rather than truck would
reduce GHG emissions as well as traffic congestion, air and noise pollution, safety
impacts associated with increased truck traffic, and infrastructure wear and tear. The
current Class I (large freight) railroad business model does not lend itself well to smallscale movements or movements less than 300 miles. Short-line railroads, however, are
suitable for filling this niche.

•

Investigate the development of a New Jersey-based Marine Highway Program
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the U.S. Maritime Administration, and
others are considering a new generation of waterborne commerce as an alternative to
truck and rail movements for some container movements. Containers could potentially
be moved from New Jersey facilities in the Port of New York and New Jersey by barge
or special vessels to Raritan Center, Camden, Paulsboro or Salem for example, reducing
land traffic and potentially reducing vehicle emissions. Future developments could
include port-to-port movements along the Eastern seaboard.
Congestion in our transportation system costs Americans an estimated $200 billion every
year, 4.2 billion hours in traffic, and 2.9 billion gallons of fuel. There are, on average,
currently 10,500 trucks per day per mile on the Interstate Highway System. 85 By 2035,

this is projected to more than double 86 . On the other hand, America’s Marine Highway
system is currently underutilized. The Marine Highway Program is designed to integrate
coastal and inland waterways into the nation’s surface transportation system, reducing
congestion, improving air quality, and decreasing our dependence on foreign oil 87 . New
Jersey is participating with the I-95 Corridor Coalition to study the utilization of the East
Coast Marine Highway to reduce truck VMT growth on the I 95 Corridor.
The environmental implications of expanding the Marine Highway Program have not
been well studied. The U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration
(MARAD) Interim Final Rule on America’s Marine Highway Program (October 31,
2008) provided no environmental assessment and failed to quantify potential impacts on
air pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act. Further consideration of a New Jerseybased Marine Highway Program will rest in part on results of pending environmental
assessments and MARAD’s final determination on the Interim Final Rule. Taking into
consideration any future final determination by MARAD on the Interim Final Rule, the
NJDOT will conduct a study to investigate the feasibility of developing a New Jerseybased Marine Highway Program and will issue a report and recommendations, including
estimates of GHG emission reductions.
Climate Change and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey provides essential transportation services that
support the region’s economy, but also result in the emissions of GHGs. Total emissions associated
with the Port Authority, including the operations of its tenants and patrons, amounted to nearly 5.9
million metric tons of CO2eq in 2007. Of those emissions, approximately 300,000 metric tons
stemmed from the Port Authority’s own energy consumption. The remaining 5.6 MMT were generated
by the airplanes, vehicles and ships that use the Port Authority’s facilities.
The Port Authority recognizes the threat of climate change to the region. To deal with this threat, the
Port Authority is implementing a comprehensive sustainability policy that calls for mitigation, carbon
neutrality, and the development of adaptive strategies. Specifically, the Port Authority is committed to
reducing GHG emissions from its facility activities by 80 percent from 2006 levels by 2050. The Port
Authority is also working toward its near-term goal of becoming “carbon neutral” on an annual basis,
with respect to emissions under its direct control, by 2010. In collaboration with other regional
stakeholders, the Port Authority is developing strategies that reduce the risk posed by climate change
to its facilities, its operations and the region.
For the Port Authority, investment in mass transit and a cleaner system of goods movement represent
the most effective ways to fight climate change. The Port Authority’s commitment to reducing GHG
emissions is reflected in its 10-year, $29.5-billion capital plan. That capital plan includes the PATH
System modernization and capacity enhancements, the ARC passenger rail tunnel, the expansion of
the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and Express Rail. All of these projects will take cars and trucks off
the road.
In addition to these capital investments, the Port Authority is developing programs that promote
sustainability among its patrons and tenants. Already, drivers of fuel-efficient vehicles may take
advantage of the new Green Pass Discount Plan, which offers a toll discount at the Port Authority’s
river crossings. The Port Authority is also concerned about flight delays and the resulting GHG
emissions. The Port Authority’s Flight Delay Task Force, an effort among public and private
stakeholders, is working on ways in which airplanes can navigate more efficiently at the airports.

And improving on-time performance. The Port Authority is also a strong supporter of the Federal
Aviation Administration’s Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), which represents the
most effective way to reduce GHG emissions from air travel. The Port Authority is seeking federal
funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and other sources for portrelated projects that will help reduce GHG emissions as well as other air pollutants.
In addition, the Port Authority is undertaking an aggressive plan to reduce its own emissions through
energy efficiency and renewable energy projects. New light-emitting diodes, which require less energy
than conventional lighting, are replacing the existing fixtures at the Holland Tunnel and the George
Washington Bridge. The first geothermal energy project at an airport is underway at John F. Kennedy
International Airport. Hybrid diesel-electric shuttle buses are operating at the airports. The Port
Authority’s vehicle fleet is on pace to reduce GHG emissions by more than 10 percent over the next 3
years through the use of clean vehicles and biodiesel.

4. MAINTAIN GOOD STATE OF REPAIR IN ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE AND
OPERATIONS WHILE MITIGATING GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS

Meeting New Jersey’s statewide GHG limits will require the State to ensure that its aging
transportation infrastructure is maintained through the principles of smart growth and “fix it
first”. Additionally, the State must address congestion, factoring consideration of GHG
impacts into funding and design of transportation projects, educating the public in ways that
they can lower their transportation-related “carbon footprint,” and ensuring that projects that
enhance and expand transit options are a high priority for investment. Most recently, these
approaches are reflected in the State’s capital budget for transportation as well as in the
State’s list of projects that will be funded using federal stimulus dollars under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The following additional efforts would complement those
already underway:
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #18: Establish a carbon footprint standard for transportation
projects
In order for New Jersey to achieve its long term GHG limits, transportation investments need
to give consideration to being consistent with the statewide GHG limits. Some states,
Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) and regional planning entities are researching
different ways to consider carbon impacts of transportation activities through development of
methodologies by which transportation capital program scenarios can be compared for their
carbon footprint impacts. A system needs to be developed to calculate the “carbon footprint”
of projects to help decision-makers determine whether best design practices are being
incorporated and whether GHG emission limits are being attained. Using the carbon
footprint metric, planners and regulators can ascertain whether projects are consistent with
local, state and/or regional GHG and VMT reduction limits, as well as to guide funding
decisions.
Clearly, any efforts to consider carbon footprint of transportation activities must include an
agreed upon process that accounts for transportation agencies’ need to meet basic system
preservation, safety and mobility goals, such as System Preservation or Infrastructure
Preservation projects (e.g., resurfacing, bridge replacement). Additionally, development of
any method to consider carbon footprint of transportation activities will require an analysis of
costs and benefits, as well as a lifecycle assessment approach, to ensure that desired results
67



(i.e. long term net GHG emission reductions) are, in fact, met. Consideration should be
given to the extent to which existing policy tools, such as analysis under Executive Order
215, may serve as an effective vehicle for disclosing and mitigating CO2 impacts of
transportation projects. The NJDOT is working cooperatively with NJDEP, Rutgers
University and other relevant state agencies to examine possible methodologies to effectively
consider carbon footprint impacts of transportation projects using a lifecycle assessment.
This project is also studying approaches to state policies that would effectively implement
consideration of “carbon footprint” impact in transportation projects and planning.

New Jersey Turnpike Authority “Green Corridor” Program
In January of 2009, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority (NJTA) adopted, as part of its overall
2009 Strategic and Capital Improvement Plan, a “Green Corridor” program consisting of
policies and projects designed to facilitate meeting the GWRA’s goal of reducing GHGs.
Specifically, the NJTA’s “Green Corridor” program encompasses the following actions:
•

•
•
•
•
•

•
•

Undertake an energy needs analysis for the entire Turnpike and Parkway system with a
specific goal of identifying opportunities for renewable and other clean energy programs,
and with a commitment to implement solar and/or wind power as part of new
construction activities;
Work with the NJDOT and the NJDEP to explore the creation of “clean energy” fueling
stations for vehicles alongside our traditional gas and diesel, including electric plug-in
charging stations, compressed natural gas and other alternative fuels;
Establish a “Clean and Green” policy for new construction activities that will require
green building design techniques and sustainable design elements;
Establish a policy requiring the retrofit and reconstruction of established service area
facilities to “clean and green” standards;
Continue to maximize the use of EZ Pass and electronic toll collection to further reduce
fuel consumption and GHG emissions;
Require that energy efficiency be considered when replacing existing light fixtures or
installing new lighting fixtures. This will include the potential for the installation of
compact fluorescent or LED roadway luminaries if their lighting characteristics are
determined to meet the Authority’s lighting criteria to ensure the safety of motorists;
To the maximum extent practicable, have existing barren NJTA properties planted and
forested to not only help offset GHG emissions in the State, but also to offset the heat
island effects of new pavement; and,
Commit to a vehicle maintenance wastewater reclamation system, which allows the
recycling of wastewater. A pilot program is currently underway at the Clark
Maintenance Yard.

The NJTA has created an executive-level committee “Green Corridor Team” to shepherd this
effort.
•

Expand Emergency Service Patrols
The use of Emergency Service Patrols (ESP) in high-traffic corridors for the purpose of
incident management has been shown to reduce non-recurring congestion. The ESP’s
ability to help reduce congestion is accomplished by methods that range from calling the
68



police and towing services, helping to divert traffic around an accident, and pushing a
stalled vehicle from a traffic lane to a shoulder to perform emergency repairs. Incident
Management Teams respond quickly to traffic incidents and disabled vehicles, hastening
the resumption of regular traffic flow through the site. ESP on the 395 miles of roadway
currently patrolled will be expanded from 80 hours per week to 100 hours per week. This
will increase the service from a weekday service to a weekday/weekend service.
This highly-visible and successful program has assisted nearly 90,000 customers in the
past year and has a benefit-to-cost ratio of 19 to 1. The benefit-to-cost ratio is developed
by calculating the time savings of motorists not stuck in traffic and dividing it by the
actual program costs. For example, for every minute a lane is closed due to roadway
debris or an accident, four minutes of delay results. ESP has historically responded to the
majority of incidents in less than 10 minutes. Prior to ESP, the average for removal was
30 minutes. This 20 minute savings results in 80 minutes of delay avoided per incident.
With the user cost-per-vehicle averaging approximately $12 per hour, a single ESP
response to an incident on I-80 can save the motoring public approximately $115,000 (4
lanes x 1800 vehicle/hr./lane x $12/hr. x 1.333hrs). The resulting idling reductions will
generate an annual fuel cost saving to consumers of approximately $400,000 based on a
$2.50 per gallon fuel price.
•

Expand signal synchronization
Signal synchronization/optimization is an application that coordinates the timing of
traffic signals to minimize delay, reduce congestion, and improve safety along hightraffic areas. While these improvements can range in cost from approximately $3,000 per
retiming to $150,000 for complete unit replacement, synchronization and optimization
represents a unique and comparatively simple opportunity to reduce fuel consumption,
and consequently reduce GHG emissions.

•

Achieve reduction in diesel vehicle idling
Idling consumes fuel while moving no product, reduces engine life, requires additional
engine maintenance, and pollutes the air. New Jersey will continue its efforts to reduce
diesel vehicle idling through 1) encouraging the expanded use of truck anti-idling
strategies, such as auxiliary power and truck stop electrification; 2) increased
enforcement, including non-road vehicles; and 3) implementation of idling reduction
technologies and policies for locomotives and marine vessels.

Three specific projects that will have GHG benefits are:
Expanded use of truck anti-idling strategies. Many long haul truck drivers idle their
trucks to heat or cool their cab during the federally-required 10 hours rest period for every 11
hours spent on the road. As a result, heavy-duty diesel trucks idle approximately 28,000
hours per day in New Jersey. The State will encourage the expanded use of anti-idling
strategies such as use of Truck Stop Electrification (TSE) and on-board Auxiliary Power
Unites (APUs). TSE allows vehicles to hook up to units that provide heat, air-conditioning
and other amenities. The NJDEP and its partners have funded the installation of 254
electrified spaces to date, with an additional 75 spaces planned along the New Jersey
Turnpike. These spaces will save over a million gallons of fuel annually. As of May 1,
2008, vehicles were no longer allowed to idle in parking spaces that are equipped with
69



electrification technology. On-board APUs are installed on the truck and provide heat and
air conditioning. Approximately 50 percent of trucks currently use APUs, which reduce fuel
use (as compared to idling) by as much as 90 percent and are saving 2 million gallons of fuel
each year in the state. APU use continues to grow as diesel fuel prices rise.
Increased enforcement. New Jersey will continue its efforts to reduce idling through
increased enforcement of its anti-idling regulations, including its recently adopted rule
amendments N.J.A.C. 7:27-14.3(b)6 that include a provision to sunset the exemption for
idling trucks while using sleeper berths, effective May, 2010. In addition, over the next few
years, the NJDEP will expand enforcement from its current focus on on-road diesel vehicles
to include a focus on idling of non-road vehicles, particularly construction vehicles.
Implementation of idling reduction technologies and policies for locomotives and
marine vessels. For locomotives, technologies are available to automatically shut down
engines and maintain operating temperatures. Marine vessels can reduce idling by
connecting to shore-side electrical power, which requires modifications to the vessel and
provision of electrical power to the docks. New Jersey will continue to investigate the use of
such strategies, from a technical and policy perspective, and seek ways to implement them on
a more widespread basis.
5. REDUCE THE GROWTH IN VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED
The transportation sector makes up approximately 35 percent of New Jersey’s gross GHG
emissions; the passenger automobile contributes the vast majority of those transportation
sector emissions. Because there is a direct correlation between sprawling land development
patterns and personal vehicle use, as measured by vehicle miles traveled (VMT), the critical
role that land use policies play in achieving the statewide GHG limits cannot be underscored
enough. It will be difficult for New Jersey to meet its statewide GHG limits without a
fundamental shift in the State’s historic development patterns.
A recent report by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
(AASHTO) observes that there are many factors that can affect the growth rate of VMT.
AASHTO’s Primer on Transportation and Climate Change 88 states that, “while
technological change is essential to reducing GHG emissions, there is also a role for
strategies that help to limit the growth in travel demand.” Going forward, even a seemingly
small difference in VMT growth rates - e.g., the difference between 1.5 percent and 2.0
percent annual growth - can make an enormous difference in the total amount of VMT on the
roads in 2030 or 2050.
Energy use and carbon emissions can be reduced through smart land use and transportation
policies. Mixed land use and higher densities can shorten distances between origins and
destinations, which allow alternative forms of transportation and reduce automobile
dependence, as well as provide the necessary population density to support public transit.
The Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission undertook a regional growth scenario
planning exercise to better understand how different development patterns affect land use,
transportation, the environment and economic development. The three growth scenarios
88

Primer on Transportation and Climate Change, American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO), April 2008. See
http://downloads.transportation.org/ClimateChange.pdf
70



examined included trend, sprawl and recentralization. The resulting report, Making the Land
Use Connection 89 , describes how recentralization (locating most population and employment
growth in core cities and developed communities) offers the best solutions for a sustainable
future. This scenario best prepares the region for combating global climate change and
energy volatility. It improves quality of life for the region’s residents by offering more
mobility choices, while preserving open space and reducing household expenses.
The Urban Land Institute (ULI) projects that nationally, two-thirds of development expected
to be on the ground in 2050 is not yet built, offering great promise for affecting change in
this sector. While that estimate is likely to be lower in a highly-developed state like New
Jersey, it is still clear that reversing the State’s sprawling land use patterns is a significant
part of the solution to meeting New Jersey’s statewide GHG limits. The ULI points to
sustainable land use patterns as having the potential to reduce driving from 20 to 40 percent
and that people living in compact urban neighborhoods where cars are not the only
transportation option drive a third fewer miles than those in automobile-oriented suburbs.
The good news is that a recent land development study by Rutgers and Rowan Universities 90
confirms that sound state and regional planning policies, such as the Pinelands
Comprehensive Management Plan, are effective in targeting development towards existing
areas of infrastructure.
At the state level, New Jersey’s objective is to develop consistent and coordinated state,
regional and local land use strategies and to incorporate New Jersey’s statewide GHG limits
into the transportation sector. By developing preferred growth strategies that integrate smart
growth objectives, state, local and regional land use planning can be the vehicle that ensures
that land use and transportation planning is aligned with the statewide GHG limits. By
incorporating attainment of other important public policy objectives (including affordable
housing, economic growth and natural resource protection) the alignment of land use and
transportation planning with the statewide GHG limits can serve to provide a unified
foundation for sound growth management in New Jersey. Additionally, these efforts provide
opportunities for the state, regional planning entities, Metropolitan Planning Organizations
and local governments to consider specific strategies for adapting to climate change impacts
as part of their on-going planning.
In light of New Jersey municipalities’ strong home-rule authority, it is necessary to build
capacity at the local level that leads to incorporation of GHG considerations into land use
planning and decision-making. Many of New Jersey’s municipalities are leading the way
with plans and programs to reduce GHGs through energy efficiency, sustainable design and
planning, and innovative programs. Recognizing this leadership at New Jersey’s local level,
10 percent of RGGI auction proceeds are being made available by NJDEP to local
governments through a grant program. The Local Government GHG Reduction Grant
Program will be a funding source for municipalities striving to develop and implement both
conventional and innovative smart growth policies that will reduce VMT and increase other
mobility options.

Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #19: Employ efforts for effectively implementing the SDRP
The State Development and Redevelopment Plan (SDRP), if implemented effectively can be
a powerful tool to guide more sustainable land use policies, and in doing so can result in
significant greenhouse gas emission reductions in the transportation sector.
The purpose of the SDRP is to “coordinate planning activities and establish statewide
planning objectives in the following areas: land use, housing, economic development,
transportation, natural resources conservation, agriculture, farmland retention, recreation,
urban and suburban redevelopment, historic preservation, public facilities and services and
intergovernmental coordination.” (N.J.S.A. 52:18A-200(d))
To achieve its purpose, the SDRP is expected to receive “input from state, county and
municipal entities concerning their land use, environmental capital and economic
development plans, including to the extent practicable any state plans concerning natural
resources or infrastructure elements” (N.J.S.A.52:18A-200 ( c)). The goals and objectives of
the SDRP are generally consistent with the GHG-reduction land use and transportation
recommendations of this report, in that both the SDRP and this report propose a land use
vision that encourages the development and redevelopment of centers and the creation of
more compact, walkable and livable communities, while reducing development in areas
outside of centers or more compact communities. In addition, the modification to earlier
versions of the SDRP that is currently underway includes a new goal related to GHG
emission reductions consistent with the Global Warming Response Act.
The SDRP is not intended to be regulatory document. Rather, it is intended to inform public
investment, government spending and regulatory programs and tax policy decision-making.
The SDRP can serve to facilitate the coordination and integration of practices, policies, plans
and programs within State government’s executive branch; provide a forum through which
conflicts may be reconciled and increased accountability may be established; recognize and
provide enhanced public benefit that is unlikely to be achieved through strict adherence to
individual regulatory programs alone; and to provide a guide for land use decision-making by
local government jurisdictions.
To realize the full potential of the SDRP when it operates in these capacities:
•

•

The SDRP and its State Plan Policy Map must be kept current. Therefore, the process by
which they remain up-to-date should be improved. For example, significant and farreaching State government changes are currently underway with respect to the
preparation of wastewater management plans, fair-share housing plans, and long-term
transportation plans. The SDRP should be taking these changes into account in routine
and predictable ways. Current limitations should be acknowledged and addressed and a
process created to ensure consistency among the multiple State departments and agencies,
their practices, policies, plans and programs.
The SDRP requires an action-oriented implementation plan that describes the steps
needed to ensure improved coordination and integration so that activities along with roles
and responsibilities across multiple State departments and agencies as well as local
jurisdictions are well-defined, transparent and more clearly understood. State departments
72



•

and agencies can employ the SDRP as a guide to inform their respective practices,
policies, plans, and programs. State departments and agencies can be required to review
their existing practices, policies, plans and programs and make appropriate modifications
within the scope of their respective authorities to implement the SDRP as the sustainable
growth plan for the State of New Jersey. For example, as a result of its Permit Efficiency
Task Force’s deliberation, NJDEP is considering how to create a rapid turnaround path
for “green projects” in sustainable growth locations and plan-endorsed town centers.
The SDRP is a guidance document that requires the strengthening of existing incentives
and creation of new incentives to encourage its implementation. These incentives are
especially important to encourage counties and municipalities to implement the SDRP.
State departments and agencies can employ their authority with respect to both resource
allocation and regulatory decision-making to strengthen and create these incentives to
support the coordination, integration and alignment of county and municipal practices,
policies, plans and programs with the vision and goals of the SDRP.

Recommendation #20: Undertake cooperative efforts with the State’s Metropolitan
Planning Organizations to assist them in incorporating GHG reduction targets into
their plans and programs
Federal funds for transportation projects are funneled through the regional Metropolitan
Planning Organizations (MPOs) which work with the NJDOT, NJ Transit and local and
county governments to prioritize transportation projects. These efforts offer great promise to
integrate recommendations discussed in this report that pertain to integrating the statewide
GHG limits into statewide transportation and land use planning. To the greatest extent
possible, the State, MPOs, regional planning entities and local governments must work
together to ensure that all regional transportation planning and investments are consistent
with progress toward the statewide 2050 GHG limit.
State agencies will continue to work cooperatively with the three MPOs to integrate New
Jersey’s statewide GHG limits into their plans and programs while maintaining consistency
with their core mission of preserving the transportation system and maintaining mobility in
the most environmentally sound manner possible. Additionally, NJDOT and the MPOs will
determine how to best ensure that transportation infrastructure investment plans (e.g., New
Jersey Long Range Transportation Plan, MPO Regional Transportation Plans, NJDEP and
New Jersey Transit Capital Program, MPO Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs),
etc.) support attainment of statewide GHG limits.
Working in partnership with the MPOs, local governments and stakeholders, New Jersey
could use a portion of RGGI auction proceeds to undertake pilot programs with counties and
MPOs to integrate the statewide GHG limits into regional transportation planning. Such pilot
programs could build on the county-level wastewater, transportation, and other planning
initiatives now underway by offering targeted county grants to prepare strategic Sustainable
Energy/GHG Reduction Plan elements as part of updated county master plans that will (a)
meet targets for reduced VMT; (b) promote compact, sustainable growth in areas with
infrastructure (and near transit where available); (c) reduce sprawl development; and (d)
identify sustainable solutions for other high priority planning goals such as affordable
housing and creation of job centers.

Related Action(s) with Climate Benefits:
•

The State will take actions to promote Transit-Oriented Development
Concentrations of high-quality, mixed-used development and business centers within
walking distance of transit stations encourage transit use and residential and employment
alternatives to sprawl development. Through state agency mechanisms such as model
code ordinances, Plan Endorsement, and Water Quality Management Planning, New
Jersey can promote higher density and Transit-Oriented Development (TOD), as well as
encourage infill, compact and mixed use development (including clustering) that
incorporates pedestrian and bicycle-friendly design. New Jersey Transit is seeking to
partner with at least five communities each year along its existing bus and rail system
where it has a station, terminal or major bus stop, to expand TOD planning efforts.

•

Working in partnership with state agencies and local governments, explore changes
to the Municipal Land Use Law that are designed to incorporate the statewide GHG
limits into local government master planning
There are a variety of ways in which the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL) and other
related land use laws could be amended to attain consistency with the statewide GHG
limits. Such statutory changes could include:
•
•

•
•
•
•

•

Establishment of mandates and/or incentives for municipalities that incorporate
provisions into master plan elements that are consistent with the statewide GHG
limits;
Development of standards and incentives for municipalities to incorporate provisions
in their local planning that fosters centralization of employment centers in
relationship to mass transit; compact development in areas appropriate for growth and
that discourage sprawling development patterns; and, walkable, mixed-use
development;
Ability for municipalities to charge development fees for use in offsetting VMT and
the loss of carbon sequestration associated with new development;
Availability of state legal support for local governments that are challenged for
incorporating the statewide GHG limits into their planning;
Simplification of New Jersey’s Transfer of Development Rights authorities in order
to assist municipalities in directing development in more concentrated ways that
avoid sprawl and maximize open space; and,
Establishment of programs to allow local governments to earn points for additional
state dollars through the implementation of sustainable land use planning (similar to
the Massachusetts CommCap Program).

Ensure that the Residential Site Improvement Standards are consistent with the
GHG limits
Specific areas to evaluate to ensure that the statewide GHG limits and VMT reduction
targets are tied into project design could include decreasing the required number of
parking spaces associated with development and promotion of parking demand
management strategies as well as encouraging infill and denser development.

The NJDEP and other state agencies are continuing to provide in-kind resources to
support the New Jersey State League of Municipalities’ Sustainable Jersey program
The NJ State League of Municipalities (NJSLOM) through collaboration with the
NJDEP, NJBPU, Rutgers University and the Municipal Land Use Center at The College
of New Jersey has created “Sustainable Jersey” program to encourage leadership in
sustainable practices at the local level. With start-up monies from the Dodge Foundation
and additional resources, the collaborative program establishes specific actions that NJ
municipalities must successfully implement in order to receive designation as a “green
community” by the NJSLOM. The primary purposes of the Sustainable Jersey Program
are to 1) establish clear performance standards and actions for communities striving to be
considered green; 2) provide guidelines and tools to assist in implementation; and, 3)
create public and private incentives to encourage and facilitate greening action.
Sustainable Jersey addresses issues such as climate change, air and water pollution,
biodiversity, land use, water conservation, equity, buying local, local economies, and
sustainable agriculture. A set of required and voluntary actions for Year 1 were
developed by the convening partners with significant input from a group of involved
mayors and other municipal officials, and efforts to develop a set of required and
voluntary actions for Year 2 are currently underway. The partners’ intent in developing
these required and voluntary actions is to ensure that the Sustainable Jersey Program
complements and supports the strategies being developed to achieve New Jersey’s
statewide GHG limits and the local government program using proceeds from the RGGI
auction.

The NJDOT commits to use and promote a “Complete Streets” policy to guide
sound planning, engineering, operating and maintenance practices for all
roadway projects by all transportation agencies in New Jersey
“Complete Streets” accommodate all modes of transportation, including walking and
bicycling, resulting in reduced VMT and GHG reductions. Specifically, the NJDOT
is ensuring that:
Planning, design, operation and maintenance of all road projects will result in a
Complete Streets policy appropriate to local context and needs.
The Complete Streets policy is promulgated through design standards in the New
Jersey Roadway Design Manual, the Smart Transportation Guidebook and similar
publications.
The Complete Streets policy applies to both new and retrofit projects, including
design, planning, maintenance, and operations, for the entire right of way. All streets
are different and user needs will be balanced.
Complete Streets performance standards with measurable outcomes are established.
The NJDOT will update the State Highway Access Management Code to
encourage smart growth
The NJDOT commits to advancing all feasible revisions to the State Highway Access
Management Code, and will evaluate proposals such as: creating a new “Main
Street” classification; permitting developers to take advantage of a “multimodal
transit credit” where appropriate; simplifying the process for creating and maintaining
Access Management Plans; and revising the future vision for the state highway.

This assistance will be administered through mechanisms such as New Jersey Future
in Transportation (NJFIT), Mobility & Community Form, and the Transit Village
Initiative Program to review new corridors for integrating transportation and land use
planning as well as continue to transit-oriented development. Specifically, this action
includes the following efforts:
The NJDOT will develop and implement the next phase of its “New Jersey Future in
Transportation” transportation and land use corridor planning initiative - The “Future
in Transportation” (NJFIT) label is used to integrate transportation and land use
planning at the corridor level. NJFIT also provides information to municipalities on
development of Transit Villages and the use of people-centered community forms,
both of which encourage greater use of non-auto dependent transportation. The
NJDOT will re-commit to its NJFIT program by reviewing new corridors for smart
growth project consideration.
The NJDOT will continue to promote and assist communities with implementation of
the Mobility and Community Form program – Mobility and Community Form
planning looks to create better connections between the local system and the design
of community facilities, buildings and open space. Benefits include economic vitality,
pedestrian and bicycle access and land use patterns that support public transit,
improve quality of life and foster a sustainable environment.
The NJDOT will look for opportunities to enhance its current Transit Village
Initiative Program – These enhancements will encourage transit-oriented residential
and commercial/retail development in areas proximate to (within ½ mile of) existing
rail stations, major bus stops and ferry terminals. The primary objectives of this
program are to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality by increasing transit
ridership. To date, 19 communities have been designated transit villages and
additional communities will be enrolled in 2009. The Transit Village Incentive
Program is voluntary and provides only modest incentives to encourage transitoriented development. However, the program can be used as a means to help local
governments reform land use policies in station areas and to focus state investment
programs to encourage the development of new housing at transit-supportive
densities. To date, the Transit Village Initiative Program has concentrated primarily
on residential development around transit stations/stops, thereby encouraging the
creation of "transit village communities" for commuters. However, a separate but
related effort has begun to encourage business development, capital investment and
employment at Urban Transit Hub locations – projects within one-half mile of New
Jersey Transit, PATCO or Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) rail stations in nine
urban municipalities. Tax credits for capital investments made where at least 250
people work can spur urban redevelopment, attract jobs and increase transit as a
modal choice. Urban Transit Hub locations include areas such as Newark’s Central
Business District (CBD), Jersey City, Elizabeth, Hoboken, New Brunswick, Trenton
and Camden.

6. ENHANCE LOW GHG COMMUTING PROGRAMS AND DOUBLE TRANSIT

RIDERSHIP BY 2050
To complement New Jersey’s aggressive efforts to reduce VMT, the State must make
increasing transit and green commuting programs a cornerstone of its efforts to achieve
the statewide GHG limits. In particular, New Jersey is committed to continue its
investment in transit and to maximize ridership over the next ten years, and by
implementing current and future capital programs, plans to more than double its transit
ridership by 2050.

Climate Change and New Jersey Transit
An essential consideration in evaluating New Jersey Transit's (NJT) carbon footprint is the amount of
carbon that is "avoided" because of reduced emissions and congestion relief that occurs when
individuals choose to use mass transit instead of driving. NJT's carbon footprint, when measured
using a transit industry proposed methodology, is the net of carbon emissions from total energy
consumption from all NJT functions - bus, rail and light rail operations, stations, maintenance facilities
and non-revenue vehicles - and the carbon avoided by NJT riders' use of transit, which results in
avoided auto trips and reduced highway congestion. A July 2008 report evaluates, enumerates and
represents NJT's role as a "key resource in reducing the larger regional CO2 output from the
transportation sector." ("A Comprehensive Assessment of NJ Transit's Carbon Footprint," by Science
Applications International Corporation.)
As the use of public transportation in New Jersey continues to increase, so will NJT's energy
consumption and carbon emissions. After applying the transit industry's proposed methodology,
however, there is an actual and measurable clean air benefit to New Jersey that results from an
increased reliance on public transportation. NJT is currently participating in the nationwide effort to
quantify the amount that transit use serves as an "offset" to GHG emissions, based on vehicle miles
traveled, congestion mitigation, and land use effects.
NJT has experienced unprecedented growth in service and ridership since 2000. The increased
growth forecast for the years 2007-2010, and the consequent increased fuel and energy used, will
result in an increase in actual GHG emissions for NJT each year in this period.
•

NJT's CO2 emissions from the operational component increased 26 percent between 2000
and 2006, or a 3.7 percent annual rate of growth. Much of this growth comes from an
increase in service that resulted in growth in revenue miles and passenger miles.

•

NJT's facility energy usage and CO2 emissions have been stable from 2000-2006 in spite of
an increase in the number of new facilities during this period. This stability is the result of an
aggressive energy management plan instituted in 1996 that implemented a number of energy
conservation measures and alternate fuel non-revenue vehicle purchases aimed at reducing
energy consumption.

It is important to note that moving towards greater reliance on transit requires a companion
commitment to increase investment in, and ensure a reliable, steady source of operational funds for
transit so that both the capacity and day to day operations remain sufficient to carry passengers as
they choose the alternative to driving alone.

With one of the most extensive transit infrastructures in the nation, New Jersey is ideally
poised to capture the rising wave of demand for housing near transit and simultaneously
rebuild its older communities. NJ Transit operates eight commuter rail lines serving 149
stations; three light rail lines serving 60 stations; and a statewide network of 242 bus
routes. New Jersey is also served by two separate transit agencies—PATH and
PATCO—that provide commuter rail service between Northern Jersey and Manhattan
77



and Southern New Jersey and Philadelphia, respectively. At 10.4 percent, New Jersey is
third, trailing only the District of Columbia and New York, in the percentage of residents
who use public transportation to commute to work. 91 Over the last 24 fiscal years (19832008), New Jersey has made major investments to connect previously independent
private rail lines to create a cohesive network of rail services, build strategic light rail
services, and increase frequency and reliability of all bus and rail location to major
metropolitan job centers. These investments have resulted in a 64 percent increase in
total ridership over that time period (159 million passenger trips to 260 million). Rail
ridership has doubled since 1985, and is up 138 percent compared to 25 years ago (32
million to 76 million). Thanks to the extensive transit network, and the fact that 75
percent of New Jersey’s population is within a half mile of a rail station or bus line, New
Jersey residents have the opportunity to limit their single occupancy vehicle use.
There is a direct link between development density and transit. However, density alone
will not act as the impetus for a shift to transit. Other transit friendly land use changes
will be required to affect the demand for transit such that there is a continued shift from
“drivers to riders” in New Jersey. For example, the abundance of low cost or free
parking across the State is inefficient and impacts the demand for transit services. The
current practice of under-pricing parking in many areas of the State increases automobiledependency and reduces mobility alternatives. Parking management demand strategies
that address more efficient use of existing parking, variable demand, and reduction of
demand could reduce the amount of land needed for parking and the negative impacts of
parking on transit ridership. NJ Transit estimates that by implementing its existing
Capital and State of Good Repair programs, a net of more than 1 MMT of CO2 would be
avoided.
However, NJ Transit lacks the level of funding necessary to cover the operating costs of
the existing system or to expand the system to accommodate the growth in ridership
necessary to meet New Jersey’s GHG limits. NJ Transit often utilizes funds from its
capital budget to keep vehicles and infrastructure in working condition. In order to reach
transit ridership targets set to achieve long-term GHG emission reductions, a stable
source of funding for NJ Transit operations will be necessary.
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #21: The State will work in partnership with local and regional entities to
assess infrastructure capacity of the 113 municipalities that will benefit from the ARC 92
tunnel as well as the municipalities that are served by, and feed, the Port Authority Transit
Corporation (PATCO) rail and bus lines, and whose residents commute to Atlantic City,
Camden and Philadelphia
These two assessments will complement the investment in transit, including the ARC tunnel
and PATCO additions, by focusing state infrastructure investments around transit hubs on
bus and rail lines feeding into the tunnel. These assessments will consider identifying transit

hubs with the greatest potential and needs. Working in conjunction with multiple state
agencies and local governments, these assessments will consider infrastructure needs
(including water, wastewater, stormwater, utilities, roadways, commuter parking, shuttle
feeders, stations, residential site improvement standards, etc.) and, among other things, will
inform local master planning and state prioritization of future spending for those localities
benefiting from these transit upgrades.
Related Action(s) with Climate Co-Benefits:
• Doubling Transit Ridership by 2050
Doubling of transit ridership by 2050 will require coordinated actions now, including
building more infrastructure and increasing services of all transit options in New Jersey,
from local services such as van pools, express bus and bus rapid transit 93 , to commuter
rail, light rail and ferry. However, meeting this goal will provide more New Jerseyeans
with a choice to take transit instead of driving, especially if new residential, retail and job
sites and activity centers are located close to transit services. To advance this goal, New
Jersey Transit commits $41 billion dollars in its current 20-year capital program (2030)
to:
1) Maintain the existing transit system in a state of good repair;
2) Construct the Access to Region’s Core (ARC) Mass Transit rail tunnel;
3) Complete other committed capital projects which have the potential to grow
ridershipover time; and,
4) Partner with other agencies to develop appropriate pricing policies to affect demand
for transit.
Estimates of the amount of vehicle trips reduced by funding NJ Transit’s transit system
state of good repair and implementing the capital program reach 165.6 million annually
by 2020.
•

The NJDOT and New Jersey Transit will continue to work with their
Transportation Management Association partners to further support existing
commuter option programs, and encourage the implementation of new commuter
option programs designed to encourage people to use their vehicles less
Voluntary commuter option program examples include incentives for low-carbon
commuting options; carpool incentive programs, parking cash-out programs where
parking fees are charged; location-efficient mortgages to facilitate home buying in nonautomobile dependent areas; special parking fees and tags in transit lots (stations and
park and rides) for scooters and motorcycles; telecommuting, flexible work hours and
alternative work weeks; commute alternative subsidies (TransitChek, Commuter
Tax$ave), tax incentives and value pricing; and incentives to encourage employees to
utilize trip reduction programs (such as emergency rides home, preferential parking for
carpoolers/vanpoolers, bike lockers and showers and financial incentives).

93

Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) combines the quality of rail transit and the flexibility of buses. It can operate
on exclusive transitways, HOV lanes, expressways, or ordinary streets. A BRT system combines
intelligent transportation systems technology, priority for transit, rapid and convenient fare collection,
and integration with land use policy in order to substantially upgrade bus system performance. As part
of this Green Corridors effort, the State is committed to establish BRT route networks in Newark,
Elizabeth, Paterson, Hackensack, New Brunswick, Camden and Trenton.
79



Specifically, the NJDOT is building on its existing program through efforts that will:
•

•
•

•

Increase financial and other incentives to Transport Management Associations (TMAs) to
create and promote commute option programs and to employees to use alternatives to
driving alone to work.
Expand the use of marketing techniques aimed directly at commuters to increase the
effectiveness of commute option outreach efforts.
Increase coordination related to travel demand management planning and promotion.
Coordination efforts would include municipal, county and regional economic
development agencies; Metropolitan Planning Organizations, business associations;
chambers of commerce; elected and appointed officials; and TMAs.
Encourage the use of travel demand management strategies as part of the local land
development process. This can be done through ordinance revisions that require transitfriendly design and the provision for bicycle and pedestrian facilities and amenities as
part of the site development process.
The State has also launched a “Green Commuting” initiative for State employees that
promotes existing alternatives to solo driving and incorporates alternatives line those
cited above.
The NJDOT’s ongoing efforts would benefit from a detailed assessment of the extent to
which gains in GHG emission reductions can be achieved through voluntary commuter
option programs, as well as the extent to which New Jersey may need to consider
mandatory commuter options programs and the relative cost and effectiveness of
reducing GHG emissions for mandatory options.

•

New Jersey Transit’s “Green Corridors” Initiative
New Jersey Transit’s “Green Corridors” program is a subset of its overall capital
program, discussed in more detail above in the recommendation entitled “Doubling
Transit Ridership”. Taking a multi-modal approach and focusing on key corridors
statewide with significant transit ridership (e.g. Routes 1, 9, 3/46, and Newark), the
“Green Corridors” program builds on high transit ridership corridors and invests in
improved bus service and facilities from express bus to full Bus Rapid Transit (BRT)
services to increase the frequency, speed and comfort of transit trips. Coordinating with
the NJ Turnpike Authority, the NJDOT, the NJDEP and the NJBPU on the development
of the infrastructure for electric vehicles (see Recommendation entitle “TransportationRelated Demonstration Projects), NJ Transit can coordinate service and frequencies that
attract customers to key multi-modal transportation hubs. Using new customer-friendly
technologies and locating transportation hubs where there are intersecting bus routes will
result in better customer access, as well as more frequent, comfortable and reliable bus
service. Statewide, transportation hubs would operate at 3 different levels, from the
community/neighborhood hub, to area-wide hub, to the major or regional transportation
hub – each with increasing frequencies and levels of service. Local, paratransit and
shuttle services feed the ‘backbone’ of express bus and BRT service, requiring
coordination with the NJDOT, the TMAs and local county transit services. With
supportive land use (from transit friendly planning to transit oriented development,
development of key transportation hubs within communities near to the “green
corridors”) and renewable energy facilities (from electric plug-ins, and solar photovoltaic
80



power to real-time information on arrival and departure of local and regional
transportation services) a network of interconnected services improves mobility and
reduces single occupant vehicle trips.
7. DEVELOP PRICE-BASED INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE LOWER GHG
EMISSIONS
Recent studies investigating policies to reduce CO2 emissions have concluded that strategies
which employ pricing as an incentive can have a powerful impact. 94, 95 Pricing strategies can
be used to influence vehicle purchase decisions toward the purchase of cleaner vehicles,
driver behavior toward lower emissions, and decisions on whether or when to drive by
including more of the full costs of driving as a per-trip out of pocket cost to motorist, rather
than as a hidden cost or a fixed cost of owning a vehicle.
Climate-Specific Recommendation(s):
Recommendation #22: Develop fuel-efficient vehicle incentive programs
Significant spikes in gas prices have an impact on consumer preferences for vehicles,
resulting in people turning in their SUVs for more compact, fuel-efficient vehicles which
produce fewer emissions and, in some cases, hybrid models. However, not only does the
State need to provide incentives for efficient vehicle consumer choices, it also needs to
establish policies that continue to drive the market in this direction in a way that is long-term
and consistent. In general, such policies would be designed to transform the vehicle market
towards the purchase of clean vehicles by creating financial incentives to purchase clean
vehicles. These deliberations will benefit from stakeholder input to ensure that any
incentives developed result in the desired impact of incenting consumers to purchase fuel
efficient vehicles. Like other states, New Jersey will benefit from identifying programs, such
as feebates and sales tax exemptions, designed to encourage the purchase of more fuelefficient vehicles. A mix of incentives could result in a revenue-neutral set of policies that
would complement the New Jersey LEV program. In particular, a feebate program (in which
purchasers of more fuel-efficient vehicles receive a rebate while purchasers of inefficient
“gas guzzlers” pay a fee) appears to be a promising and manageable policy for New Jersey to
implement. Under such a program, fees paid by purchasers of high-emitting vehicles fund
rebates for buyers of low-emitting vehicles.
In addition to feebates, these programs could include: modifications to existing tolls, fees,
and surcharges, such as the State’s existing surcharge on new luxury and fuel-inefficient
vehicles and offering discounts on toll roads (such as the NJ Turnpike for hybrids or other
types of fuel-efficient vehicles); pursuing additional federal funding for programs that
encourage the retirement of older, less fuel-efficient vehicles; new surcharges, such as those
on the purchase of inefficient vehicles, and exploring creating incentives to increase ZEV
market demand, such as expanding the current ZEVs sales tax exemption.

•

Assess feasibility of HOT Lanes
To complement other existing policies, New Jersey can assess the feasibility of a value
pricing strategy called high occupancy toll (HOT) lanes, and of congestion pricing
strategies generally. HOT lanes allow those who drive alone (also known as "single
occupant vehicles" or SOVs) to use the HOT lanes if they pay a toll bypassing congestion
in other lanes. High occupancy vehicles (HOV) containing two or more occupants may
ride in a HOT lane for free. A HOT lane may use an existing lane or may require a lane
to be added to the roadway.

•

Continue to Evaluate Usage Based Auto Insurance
Usage based auto insurance, sometimes called Pay-As-You-Drive or PAYD insurance, is
an innovative insurance product that provides incentives to consumers to adopt safer and
more environmentally responsible driving behaviors. A recent Brookings Institution
study 96 concluded that if all drivers paid for insurance based on miles driven, overall
driving would drop 8 percent in the nation and 13.5 percent in New Jersey. This same
study found that usage based insurance would reduce total carbon emissions by about 2
percent. It is unclear, however, how many drivers would be willing to opt for this form
of insurance coverage, how many insurers would be willing or able to adapt their systems
to provide such coverage, or how successful such a program might be from an insurance
business perspective over the long term.
Efforts underway at the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (NJDOBI) are
seeking to evaluate the impact of usage based insurance products on VMT, traffic
congestion and fuel-wasting aggressive driving behaviors in New Jersey, thereby
reducing overall fuel consumption and GHG emissions.
The initial evaluation will include information relating to an existing PAYD product
offered by an insurance company to its New Jersey policyholders since August, 2008 as
part of a pilot program. This company made this insurance available to its New Jersey
customers if they install in their cars wireless devices that tell the insurer how many miles
they drive, what time they're out on the road, and how often and how fast they accelerate
and decelerate. The company is offering substantial rate discounts for their best drivers
in this voluntary program, while potentially imposing moderate premium increases for
those who engage in discouraged driving behaviors.

Overall Environmental and Economic Analyses
The State engaged the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) and Rutgers University Center for
Energy, Economic & Environmental Policy (CEEEP) to assess the GHG emissions reduction
potential and economic impacts of the supporting recommendations and related actions discussed
in this report. These analyses focused on a subset of the supporting recommendations and
related actions that were sufficiently well-developed to be quantifiable.

CCS used a variety of techniques to estimate the GHG emissions reduction potential of the
quantifiable supporting recommendations and related actions. Those techniques are discussed in

* Rather than analyzing individual supporting recommendations and/or related actions for the Transportation and
Land Use Sector, the Centers instead looked more broadly at six of the seven overarching areas identified in the this
chapter as critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from this sector. Appendix 5 outlines which specific
supporting recommendations and related actions were bundled into these area analyses.
** As discussed below, the costs and benefits of these related actions are not included in the summary of CCS’s
economic results presented in this chapter; they are however presented in Appendices 5-7.

Beyond the three core measures already accounted for in Chapter 2 and quantified in Appendix
1, Table 3.2 shows that the largest additional GHG emissions reduction potential lies in the
transportation sector, followed by the waste management and building sectors. In evaluating the
relatively low GHG emissions reduction potential of terrestrial sequestration, it is important to
keep in mind that the measures in that sector are important for many reasons besides GHG
emissions reduction, e.g., preservation of critically important natural capital. In addition, the

97

The supporting recommendation to establish a minimum CO2 emissions performance standard for
electric generating units (EGUs) is not included in the summaries of results either here or in Appendix 5
to avoid double counting of emission reductions, as this measure is considered a complementary policy
mechanism to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) cap-and-trade program, a core
recommendation.
83



terrestrial sequestration measures require longer lead times and will be important in the State’s
efforts to meet its statewide 2050 GHG limit.
The results in Table 3.2 show that beyond the 38 MMTCO2eq of GHG emission reductions
expected for 2020 from the core measures, an estimated additional 26 MMTCO2eq of reductions
are expected in 2020 from the quantified supporting recommendations and related actions, for a
total of 64 MMTCO2eq of GHG emission reductions in 2020. As noted in Chapter 1, the
difference between the Business-as-Usual projection of 154 MMTCO2eq for 2020 and the 2020
limit of 123 MMTCO2eq is the amount of reduction needed by 2020. The reduction of 31
MMTCO2eq needed by 2020 will be achieved by the core measures if implemented fully and on
time. Therefore, the supporting recommendations and related actions would provide an important
start towards achievement of the 2050 limit.
Economic Analyses
To address stakeholder comments that the NJDEP should consider economic impacts, the State
engaged CCS and CEEEP to perform several different types of economic analyses in an attempt
to present a full picture of economic impacts. The full CCS analysis report is attached to this
report as Appendix 5. The full CEEEP analysis report is attached to this report as Appendices 6
(microeconomic analysis) and 7 (macroeconomic analysis). The supporting recommendations
and related actions that were included in the economic analyses are indicated in Table 3.2.
The types of economic analysis conducted by the Centers are as follows:
•

•

•

CCS analyzed the direct costs and cost savings of the subset of supporting recommendations
and related actions. As part of this analysis, CCS also calculated the cost-effectiveness of
those recommendations and actions. Cost-effectiveness is defined as the total cost per metric
ton of GHG emissions avoided.
CEEEP analyzed certain co-benefits of the subset of supporting recommendations and related
actions. When combined, the CCS and CEEEP results make possible a limited benefit-cost
analysis in which the benefits are compared to the costs to determine which is larger.
CEEEP also analyzed the impacts of the subset of supporting recommendations and related
actions on the State’s economy as a whole (i.e., a macroeconomic analysis) using a 300equation model of the State’s economy.

All of these analyses focused on the period from 2009 to 2020. To ensure accurate comparisons,
the results from the individual years were “discounted” to 2009 using a 3% annual discount rate;
this procedure, which is almost universally used in analyses of this kind, is explained in greater
detail in Appendix 5.
As noted above, because of limits on resources, CEEEP’s analysis only considered certain cobenefits, namely preservation of natural capital (which includes, for example, natural assets that
provide goods such as fish and timber or ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration),
avoidance of the negative economic impact or cost of GHG emissions, and the monetary value of
reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as estimated from the avoided
cost of allowance fees. Other co-benefits, e.g., the public health benefits from reduced pollution,
were not considered. For this reason, the results presented below are more conservative than
those that a more complete analysis would show. In this context, “more conservative” means that
the true benefits are higher than those shown below.
Combined Economic Results of the Supporting Recommendations

Table 3.3 summarizes the combined cost and benefit results from the CCS and CEEEP analyses
of the supporting recommendations 98 aggregated by sector. The measure-specific costeffectiveness results are presented in Appendix 5.

Figures do not include the EGU measure discussed above.

As Table 3.3 shows, the combined sector totals for the supporting recommendations analyzed by
CCS and CEEEP, when considered in isolation, have benefits that exceed their costs. This is
especially true in the case of the transportation and land use sector, where cost savings are
expected from a reduction in vehicle miles traveled. Other benefits from the supporting
recommendations include: energy savings that are expected to result from employing better
building codes or waste management practices; savings on avoided costs of refrigerants no
longer lost due to leak detection and repair for gases with high global warming potential; and
fuel cost savings due to no-till agriculture or from the use of alternatively fueled vehicles. In
total, the cost-benefit analysis shows an expected $6.2 billion in net benefits from the supporting
recommendations, a finding which indicates that the benefits of these recommendations exceed
their costs.
Macroeconomic Analysis and Results
As noted, the above summary deals with each sector of the supporting recommendations.
CEEEP also analyzed the combined impacts on the New Jersey economy of the supporting
recommendations and related actions taken together, using the Rutgers Economic Advisory
Service R/ECON™ econometric model (see Appendix 7 for details). To provide a view of how
all the recommendations in this report will impact New Jersey’s economy, CEEEP analyzed the
macroeconomic impact of the supporting recommendations and related actions in light of the
predicted economy for New Jersey in 2020 (i.e., the 2020 economic baseline) and the 2020 core
measures’ macroeconomic analysis discussed in Chapter 2. These analyses are summarized in
Table 3.4.

As Table 3.4 shows, the core and supporting recommendations and related actions taken as a
whole are projected to result in a slight gain in total employment and slight decreases in personal
income and Gross State Product (GSP) in 2020. The decreases in personal income and GSP
result from the fact that the analysis assumes higher prices for zero-emission and low-emission
vehicles and energy efficient homes; those assumptions are projected to lead to lower new
vehicle registrations and residential building permits and consequently lower retail sales. It
should be noted that these results do not reflect the environmental co-benefits described above
such as preservation of natural capital or reduction of SO2 and NOx costs.
For several reasons, the projections summarized in Table 3.4 are probably on the conservative
side. First, the costs of the measures analyzed tend to be incurred as up-front investments, while
the resulting benefits accrue over a period of years. For example, planting trees to sequester
carbon or putting infrastructure in place to reduce VMT are actions that have high initial costs,
but will incrementally reduce the impact of GHG emissions, preventing even more expense in
the future. Therefore, delays that would increase impacts to forests such as forest loss or damage
or property loss from flooding result in even greater costs to respond to these losses in the future.
Second, since the analysis uses a 2020 time horizon, benefits occurring in later years are not
counted. Third, while costs can usually be estimated in monetary terms, some benefits such as
quality of life and species preservation are difficult or impossible to quantify and hence cannot
be included in an analysis of this type, including some environmental benefits.
To reach the 2020 GHG limit, the State will need to undertake a suite of policy measures, some
of which are more cost-effective than others. The State is pursuing what are expected to be the
most cost-effective measures first, namely the three core recommendations. The macroeconomic
impacts of the core measures are negligible. The supporting recommendations and related
actions described in this chapter are somewhat more expensive; but even with these more
expensive measures, the overall net economic impact of the full suite of policy measures would
still be negligible. Considering the major stakes New Jersey has in mitigation of climate change,
the projected economic effects can be seen as a cost-effective insurance policy and as an
investment in maintaining New Jersey’s economic vitality and quality of life.

Chapter 4: Adaptation
Despite our best efforts to mitigate climate change in New Jersey, the State must develop a
comprehensive plan to adapt to current and future changes in climate. CO2 and other GHGs are
known to remain in the atmosphere for decades, and even up to centuries, from the time they are
emitted into the atmosphere. 99 Even if all emissions were stopped immediately, there would be a
lag between mitigation of emissions and cessation of warming. Thus, New Jersey is expected to
face many public health, ecological and economic impacts with specific consequences noted by
the Northeast Climate Impacts Assessment 100 .
Predictions are that in coming years, sustained higher temperatures during the summer months
will make our citizens especially vulnerable to heat-related illness. Warmer temperatures and
increases in short-term droughts are expected to have impacts on agriculture and water supply
availability. Warmer temperatures will lead to more intense rain events which, coupled with
rising seas, will leave our coastal and riparian areas especially vulnerable to flooding, with
additional repercussions for water supply. Sea level rise will impact coastal communities and
coastal habitats. Non-climate stresses, such as dense population, high impervious cover, high
nutrient loading, and high flooding potential, or a combination of these factors, will exacerbate
vulnerability to climate change. 101 These are just some examples of the long-term impacts we
expect concurrent with our efforts to mitigate GHG emissions.
Thus, a comprehensive adaptation policy must be developed as a key component of any longterm climate change action plan. Addressing these issues today just makes sense; they are
complicated and require thoughtful approaches. It is hard to predict precisely which of the losses
to New Jersey might be irreversible, yet, we must acknowledge that some may be permanent.
Still, we cannot, as some say, "wait it out.” While climate change might cause irreparable losses
in some areas, it may also create economic opportunities in others. For example, spending to
construct and/or adapt buildings and homes for storm resilience may be a good investment for
property owners in terms of personal safety and financial exposure, while providing a positive
outcome for communities in terms of reduced emergency services and preservation of a
neighborhood. Similarly, water conservation measures for protection against more intense
droughts in the long-term can certainly result in benefits for mitigation of droughts in the shortterm.
Comprehensive adaptation planning for climate change is beginning to take hold in various
regions around the United States and the world. 102, 103 , 104 , 105 Adaptation planning at all levels of

government is key to minimizing the public health, environmental and economic damage that is
expected to increase in the coming years.
Approaches to adaptation planning and priority setting involve systematical and identification of
key sectors, planning areas, vulnerabilities, exposure, and the adaptive capacity of each sector, as
well as consideration of the probability of an event or impact 106 . In addition to this risk
assessment, a key aspect of this planning process is inclusion at the outset of a broad regional
coalition of representatives from all levels of government, the private sector, academia, and nongovernmental organizations who must be prepared to develop mechanisms to respond to climate
change issues "on the ground.”
The State proposes to engage experts from academia, government, non-governmental
organizations, and the business community in developing policy recommendations on the most
pressing adaptation policies New Jersey should adopt to significantly reduce the State's risks
from climate change impacts. There will be issues unique to all ecosystems and regions
throughout the State. These actions will need to be customized to specific regions, and
eventually tailored to municipalities throughout New Jersey. By bringing together various
constituencies to develop a statewide climate change adaptation plan, New Jersey can be
proactive in fostering adaptive capacity of the built, natural and human systems statewide to
respond to climate change. Table 4.1 gives examples of sector-based adaptation issues that New
Jersey faces with respect to climate change that could be considered through a systematic
planning process. Clearly, these issues are wide-ranging; timely commencement of an
adaptation planning process is needed to complement the mitigation actions set forth in this plan.

Chapter 5: Public Outreach and Education
Meeting the statewide GHG limits established by the GWRA and implementing the
recommendations set forth in this report will require the participation, collaboration and
cooperation of a broad spectrum of State agencies, private businesses, organizations and public
officials, as well as the citizens of New Jersey. The crucial role that a well-conceived public
outreach and education program will play in the successful implementation of the efforts laid out
in this report was emphasized at every one of the State’s six stakeholder sessions held in January
2009 to discuss the draft recommendations. The participants in these stakeholder sessions were
critical of the lack of a strong overarching communications plan to complement the more
technical recommendations in the report, and encouraged the State to include a plan to foster a
broad awareness of climate change issues (including co-benefits, such as clean air and public
health) in the final report.
Efforts to educate the public about climate change would focus on four areas:
•

•

Increase the general public’s overall awareness of climate change, its potential
environmental, social, economic and political impacts on the State of New Jersey, the need to
reduce the emissions of the GHGs which lead to climate change, and the specific actions they
can take to help the State achieve its statewide GHG limits. The aim of this goal is to
evaluate, design and deliver education/information to New Jersey’s general public using the
most cost-effective means practical, including mass media if feasible. Increasing the public’s
awareness of the impact and problems associated with climate change and engaging them in
actions to reduce GHG emissions in their personal and professional lives is critical to the
State’s ability to meet the GWRA statewide GHG limits. Given current resource constraints,
the State can focus its efforts on identified opportunities for reaching large audiences that are
cost effective, including increased use of websites (e.g., the State’s Global Warming
Website), blogs, social networking tools (e.g., facebook, myspace, etc.), wikis, etc. The State
can also explore partnership opportunities with state agencies and other organizations
(including the green schools and green jobs networks in New Jersey) that can help deliver
climate change messages.
Educate specific target audiences critical to the successful implementation of the GHG
mitigation actions in this report (e.g., direct communication with regulated communities
regarding pending rulemaking initiatives). Within the context of an overall outreach effort
some outreach activities need to be specifically shaped to the needs and potential of target
audiences. The State can work with these sectors in developing appropriate messages and
can solicit their assistance in sharing messages and information with their memberships or
associates. These target audiences include:
•
•
•
•

Policy makers and administrators (includes legislators, executive office, and State and
local government agencies)
Community leaders (includes businesses, institutions, municipalities, and universities and
colleges)
Community-based organizations (includes nonprofit advocacy and education
organizations, faith based organizations, foundations)
Transportation management associations and planning organizations

Ensure that climate change is addressed in New Jersey’s revised 2009 Core Curriculum
Content Standards and that climate change curriculum and instructional resources are made
available and are promoted to New Jersey schools and youth-oriented educational efforts.
The goal of this component of the outreach and education plan is to engage the natural
curiosity and enthusiasm of young people by raising their level of understanding of climate
change so that they can act individually and collectively in their schools and communities to
help reduce the GHG emissions. New Jersey’s schools, colleges and universities, as well as
non-formal education institutions, constitute a pre-existing structure for educating New
Jersey’s youth.

While this component of the outreach and education plan would address the educational needs of
students in both formal and non-formal instructional settings (including K through 12 and higher
education, youth and scout groups, museums, science and nature centers, home schoolers, and
education organizations), the primary aim would be to ensure the inclusion of climate change
content in the State’s revised 2009 core curriculum content standards. The promotion and
availability of support resources for formal and non-formal education needs, such as curriculum
supplements and teaching aides, professional development opportunities and specialized
expertise, and technology and community-based program models, are needed to aide the delivery
of climate change content and activities to New Jersey youth.
•

Begin to develop a complementary plan that focuses on communicating the need for
adaptation strategies in New Jersey. Carbon dioxide and other GHGs persist in the
atmosphere for decades, and even up to centuries, from the time they are emitted. For this
reason, even dramatic emission reductions cannot prevent the warming effects of the GHGs
already in the atmosphere. Today’s emissions will have future public health, ecological and
economic impacts in New Jersey. Therefore, it is necessary to develop mechanisms to cope
with the affects of climate change. As with the State’s mitigation efforts, a key to the success
of that adaptation policy will be a comprehensive outreach and education plan that dovetails
with, and enhances, the other education efforts outlined in this chapter. To do this, the State
would need to determine how best to communicate risk and health impacts, ecological
impacts, economic impacts and adaptation strategies. These communication strategies would
be developed in parallel with the development of the State’s adaptation policy itself, and
would build upon the outreach and education materials developed to meet the other goals in
this chapter.

The remainder of this chapter outlines the rationale for each of these four goals and the State’s
next steps in terms of implementing a comprehensive climate change outreach and education
plan. It also identifies the outreach and education actions currently underway in New Jersey.

93



Next Steps:
The following steps could provide a solid foundation for a comprehensive outreach and
education plan:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Begin to inventory reputable information sources and materials (both general and scientific)
in an effort to create a clearinghouse of climate change information and education resources
(possibly through the State’s Global Warming Website at
http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/). This clearinghouse would list groups and agencies
engaged in activities related to climate change, as well as websites, current publications on
climate change, and contact information for organizations which address global climate
change.
Work to enhance the State’s Global Warming Website so that it is more comprehensive and
in line with the coordination efforts outlined as mitigation actions in this report.
Work to develop or enhance existing outreach materials (flyers, pamphlets, etc.) on climate
change and its impacts on New Jersey, as well as the actions that can be taken either
individually or collectively to reduce GHG emissions.
Continue educational and information exchange forums (meetings, public hearings, seminars,
discussions, workshops, etc.) with target audiences, particularly those impacted by the
mitigation actions outlined in this report.
Identify additional target audiences, including community-based organization and trade
associations that would enhance the State’s climate change outreach efforts.
Coordinate the outreach and education actions of the various state and local agencies and
organizations involved in implementing the mitigation actions in this report.
Identify existing resources and programs to implement climate change education measures.
Identify additional needs and supplemental sources of funding for climate change education
measures.
Evaluate communication outlets, including mass media and other less traditional modes (e.g.,
State and outside organization newsletters, fairs and other events, etc.) to assess the best,
most cost-effective methods for communicating with both general and targeted audiences.
Coordinate with the New Jersey Department of Education to align climate change education
resources with New Jersey revised Core Curriculum Content Standards and related
implementation tools and resources.
At universities and colleges, encourage research on global climate change and its solutions.
Integrate climate change into existing and new education competitions, such as science fairs
and higher education competitions.
Explore the potential for the use of new media (social networking sites, blogs, wikis, etc.) as
outreach tools.
Explore leveraging opportunities for mass media communications, where feasible.

Chapter 6: Beyond the 2020 Recommendations and Related Actions: Setting
the Stage for 2050 and Implementation in the Coming Months
While achieving the statewide 2020 GHG limit will require a firm commitment across the public
and private sectors, the State is confident and certain that the means to do so are clear and
doable. The essential steps are prompt action and an ongoing dedication to results. However,
the 2020 limit is an interim milestone intended to stabilize emissions. The 2050 limit – reduce
emissions to a level 80 percent below 2006 emission levels (approximately 26 MMT CO2eq) –
presents the more critical goal because it represents the emission level necessary to avoid the
worse potential effects from climate change. 108 The 2020 actions will provide a foundation for
reaching the 2050 limit. Bolder and more far-reaching actions will clearly be required to actually
attain it.
Toward a New Paradigm
In a seminal work, Researchers at Princeton University have put forth a position that the
challenge of achieving critical GHG emission reductions in the long term requires a paradigm
shift in three broad categories: 109 energy efficiency and conservation; renewable electricity and
fuels; and creation of natural carbon sinks. A fourth category, reduced reliance on cars, it is
considered to be an aspect of efficiency and conservation in the Princeton paper; however, it is
discussed separately in this chapter because the policies associated with it are inherently different
than those policies associated with energy efficiency and conservation.
The requisite policies associated with such a paradigm shift will:
•
•
•
•

Extend many of the 2020 actions more deeply and broadly across the public, private,
residential and business sectors;
Compel us to think more closely about our choices and use of energy;
Insist that we re-examine how we value greenfields and open space to ensure that their total
worth is fully characterized; and,
Prompt us to assess market signals to ensure that inherent incentives exist for carbon-neutral
options in all sectors of the economy.

In other words, citizens of New Jersey will have to govern, work and live much differently than
we do now, with an emphasis on smarter and greater efficiency. The policies, practices,
behaviors, and technologies that brought us to the current problems will obviously not lead to
their solutions.

108

It is understood that New Jersey’s independent achievement of the 2050 limit will not preclude local
climate change impacts; New Jersey recognizes its obligation to be part of the necessary global
response if impacts are to be avoided.

Market Transformation and the Green Economy
New Jersey’s long-term shift in the ways we produce and use energy, from electricity to
transportation fuels, will bring other far-reaching and society-strengthening benefits, including
bolstering our economy through the creation of markets for energy efficiency and clean energy
technologies, spurring technical innovation and “green” jobs growth, and reducing the cost of
energy by becoming more efficient and increasingly meeting our energy needs through in-state
generation. Economically-driven market transformation policies include stricter building,
appliance and auto efficiency standards, rebates and/or pricing mechanisms for efficient vehicles
and low-GHG fuels, financial incentives for the manufacture of energy efficient products and
demand side management programs which create incentives for consumers’ choice of “climate
friendly” products and services. The sooner the transition to a “green” economy begins, the
greater the benefits to the economy and the climate.
In the long term, New Jersey, as well as the rest of the nation, must consider the extent to which
its economy provides inherent incentives for climate friendly markets. A recent General
Accountability Office (GAO) panel survey of economists found that all surveyed agree that
establishing a price on GHG emissions using a market-based mechanism should be considered as
a GHG policy 110 . Market-based mechanisms refer to all mechanisms (voluntary or mandatory)
that affect demand for or supply of energy and/or carbon emissions, either through prices,
regulation or information. Also referred to as "price mechanisms", market-based mechanisms
include taxes, subsidies and green pricing.
Investing in energy efficiency, green collar jobs, and new climate-neutral technologies is not just
a way to reduce GHG emissions, but also a means to develop a robust and climate-friendly
economy at both the Federal and State level. For example, anticipated State investment in New
Jersey energy infrastructure as a result of the Energy Master Plan is estimated to result in the
creation of 20,000 jobs between now and 2020. 111 These jobs will consist of operations and
maintenance jobs, and construction jobs directly related to the State’s energy infrastructure.
Science, Research and Innovation
Achieving New Jersey’s statewide 2050 GHG limit also brings the potential payoff from
research and development. New Jersey recognizes that as the State moves forward in
confronting climate change there will continue to be important long-term research needs for our
region related to emissions sources, electricity storage, models, measurement methods,
mitigation practices, alternative technologies and adaptation strategies. Assessment of carbon
capture and storage technologies, which are intended to capture carbon from large point sources
(such as fossil fuel burning power plants) and store it in deep geological formations, is an
important research area that shows promise for GHG mitigation. To that end, the State will join
the U.S. Department of Energy's Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership and will
perform an initial assessment of New Jersey’s potential for storing CO2 in geologic and
terrestrial reservoirs. Other critical research and development issues that will need to be

addressed include alternative energy projects such as pilot projects to harness wave and tidal
energy in the New Jersey coastal region, and biofuels research and demonstration projects. All
energy-related research will need to quantify the net energy and carbon balance of the overall
process, and identify any significant non-energy-related impacts. Research is needed regarding
adaptation to a changing climate, such as impacts to coastal communities and agricultural
industries.
Key Indicators
The following represents an initial set of long-term indicators for tracking New Jersey’s progress
toward meeting its statewide 2050 GHG limit:
•

•
•

•
•
•

•

The use of renewable energy sources in the State’s energy portfolio will continue to increase
aggressively until majority of sources of electricity generation in New Jersey come from
carbon neutral sources.
All new buildings constructed after 2030 will have a net zero energy consumption through a
combination of energy efficiency requirements and renewable energy sources.
The current level of terrestrial carbon sequestration will increase by 1.53 million metric tons
(MMT) CO2 annually by 2020 and by 3.14 MMTCO2 per year by 2050. This will raise the
sequestration capacity from 7 MMTCO2 to at least 8.53 MMTCO2 annually by 2020 and to
at least 11.67 MMTCO2 annually by 2050. This will result from both an (a) expansion of the
green infrastructure 112 and the implementation of the other supplemental terrestrial carbon
sequestration measures 113 recommended in this report, and (b) investment 114 on at least half
of the approximately 700,000 acres of state lands that are being incorporated in the forest
and tidal marsh stewardship and restoration program under the Global Warming Solutions
Fund (GWSF) law. Moreover, New Jersey will further increase its terrestrial sequestration
in 2050 (by an additional 2.39 MMTCO2 annually) through new natural sink enhancement
measures on forest lands thereby raising the total target capacity to 14.06 MMTCO2
annually.
VMT growth between now and 2020 will be limited to a rate of no more than 1 percent per
year, and will stabilize thereafter.
All vehicular VMT in New Jersey will be “green” VMT within the next 15 years. 115
By 2050, ninety percent of development in New Jersey will occur in areas already served by
public infrastructure, and 99 percent of that development will be in the form of
redevelopment.

Policies for a New Paradigm
Key Policy Area 1: Energy Efficiency and Conservation
and
Key Policy Area 2: Renewable Energy and Fuels
The New Jersey EMP, released in October of 2008, lays out aggressive actions for the State to
take between now and 2020 and serves as a blueprint for New Jersey’s attainment of the 2020
statewide GHG limit. New Jersey needs to build on the foundation of these EMP actions as it
looks beyond 2020 to achieve its 2050 GHG limit.
The future of energy in New Jersey can be viewed through two lenses: generation and
consumption. While we can only speculate about our energy generation and consumption post2020, the policies laid out in the EMP give us direction as to what types of technologies and
energy sources to expect over the next 40 years, as well as what our energy demands might look
like. Specifically, the EMP 116 states that the anticipated 2020 electricity usage and the sources of
that electricity will be:
•
•

44 percent nuclear;
30 percent conventional fossil fuel and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) (using fossil fuel);
and,
26 percent renewables (13 percent wind, 10 percent biopower and waste incineration and 3
percent solar).

•

In 2020, almost 90 percent of space heating and other heating needs will still be met with fossil
fuels. We can then work from this anticipated point to project a range of possibilities for 2050.
In the energy consumption and generation scenarios presented in Table 6.1 below, it is clear that
New Jersey must strive to stabilize its energy consumption in order meet its demand through
renewable and non-carbon based energy sources. The EMP prioritizes energy efficiency
initiatives for both the residential and commercial/industrial sectors. Recommendations included
in this report, such as developing green guidelines for all new and existing construction to meet
State green guidelines, are designed to support the EMP’s energy efficiency goals, and will go a
long way towards reducing the State’s overall energy demand. Ultimately, the State must move
towards the indicator established in this report, where all new buildings constructed in the State
after 2030 will have a net zero energy consumption. By reducing their energy demands as much
as possible, and supplementing energy generation through the addition of on-site renewable
116

sources (e.g., solar power), such buildings will no longer need to pull additional power from the
State’s energy grid and will be self-sustaining from an energy standpoint.
It is likely that such further gains in energy efficiency and conservation are possible. The EMP
calls for a 20 percent reduction in energy consumption below what would otherwise be
consumed under a business-as-usual scenario by 2020. This translates to a rate of reduction in
energy consumption of approximately two percent per year. If progress at a similar rate could be
maintained until 2050, dramatic reductions in energy use could result that could eliminate the
need for the growth in generation sources as substantial as that depicted in Tables 6.1 and 6.2.
On the generation side, the potential sources of electricity generation by 2050 include renewables
(wind, biopower, solar and new and emerging technologies, such as small hydro and ocean
power), CHP, nuclear, and fossil fuel with carbon capture and sequestration or use. In order to
determine what mix of these sources would be needed to meet our 2050 energy consumption
needs, the NJBPU, with input from the NJDEP, developed a range of 2050 energy consumption
projections. Table 6.1 shows the various 2050 energy consumption scenarios considered, as well
as an assessment of how those energy demands might be met. 117 Table 6.2 shows how the State
predicts it could meet those various 2050 energy consumption scenarios compared to how the
State’s overall energy demands are currently met, and also depicts the 2020 scenario expected to
result from implementation of the EMP. Both tables project that for 2050 the State can meet its
energy needs through a mix of renewable and carbon-neutral energy sources.

* Values from 2020 and 250 have been rounded to nearest 100 GWh.
An insignificant amount of the imported electricity in 2004 was generated by renewable sources.

Based on the commitments in the EMP, the State expects that that renewable and biopower
generation could produce approximately 106,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity 118 :
enough to meet both the low and high ends of the 2050 non-transportation electricity
consumption range, as well as the low end of the transportation sector consumption range. This
highlights the enormous potential that renewable energy has to address the statewide 2050 GHG
limit, making the EMP’s push for increasing these renewables even more critical for the 2050
timeframe. For those scenarios where additional energy generation beyond renewable and
biopower sources would be needed, the possible sources would include converting the CHP
facilities to use hydrogen that is generated from non-carbon emitting sources, such as nuclear
power or fossil fuel (coal or natural gas) with carbon capture and sequestration.

118

Currently, there is not a convenient and economical way to store electricity generated by renewable or
conventional energy sources. This estimate assumes that current electricity storage issues have been
resolved and that some energy loss would occur through that process.
100



Table 6.2 projects aggressive goals for renewable electricity sources, including wind and solar.
For example, providing 74,700 GWh of electricity from wind power by 2050 would call for the
construction of approximately 25,000 megawatts (MW) of wind capacity by then. This
represents 5000 wind turbines of 5 MW each, which would have to be installed at a rate of at
least two per week between now and 2050. Should such dramatic growth in renewable sources
not occur, other sources, including nuclear power, must be considered if energy use grows as
projected between 2020 and 2050.
The State is confident that a combination of a variety of additional sources would produce
enough additional capacity to meet the State’s 2050 electricity, transportation and heating needs,
even under the high usage scenario. Continued progress in energy efficiency and conservation
would mean that economic growth could continue without consumption reaching the high usage
scenario.
This conceptual assessment gives perspective on what the generation-related Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Energy indicators established above might show in the future. Meeting all of
these scenarios relies heavily on an ever increasing supply of renewable energy sources, and the
elimination of our State’s reliance on carbon-based energy sources that do not have the ability to
sequester that carbon safely and efficiently.
Meeting the State’s electricity needs with renewable, biopower, nuclear or carbon neutral fossil
fuel generation, electrifying the transportation system from these same sources along with a
portion of the heating needs could eliminate most of the current GHG emissions from the
electricity generation, residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors. If this were
done, and if most of the industrial process energy needs now provided by fossil fuel combustion
were converted to electric power, if emissions of halogenated gases were reduced to de minimus
levels, if emissions from natural gas transmission and distribution systems were essentially
eliminated, if carbon sequestered by forests was held steady or increased, and if landfill
emissions were to continue their long-term decline, the State’s GHG emissions could be held to
below 26 MMTCO2eq in 2050, allowing the State to meet the reduction goal of 80 percent below
2006 emissions.
Key Policy Area 3: Creation, Maintenance and Enhancement of Natural Sinks
As noted previously, terrestrial sequestration of CO2 is estimated to offset 5 percent of New
Jersey's gross GHG emissions (approximately 7 MMT of CO2e from New Jersey's atmosphere).
The challenge is to create, maintain and enhance a sustainable network of natural sinks within
the state's terrestrial domain. This presumes halting the statewide loss of forest land and
maintaining New Jersey's wetland resources. Knowing that development continues, a suite of
additional measures including land preservation, specific reforestation activities and sustainable
forestry and farming practices, all of which have the potential to alter carbon sequestration
processes, are recommended to meet the statewide 2020 limit. As noted, the actions to be taken
in the medium-term seek to establish a stable base for sustained carbon sequestration in the longterm. This will be supplemented by innovative efforts to increase biomass and soil carbon
densities given the limited availability of land. The use of forest residues and woodwastes for
high value durable and long-lived products that also store carbon will also be explored.

101



Increasing the terrestrial carbon sequestration capacity to 14.06 MMT CO2 annually through an
increase in biomass and soil carbon uptake is a target the State strives to achieve by 2050, not
only because of the sequestering capacity of terrestrial resources that helps to offset the
emissions of GHG sources, but also because it avoids releasing GHGs by preventing the
destruction of our terrestrial resources (estimated to be 1.1 MMT of CO2e based on annual land
clearing data for New Jersey). Some examples of measures that could be implemented
additionally to help the State attain its 2050 terrestrial sequestration target are:
GHG Reduction and Carbon Sequestration Potential of Agriculture
Agriculture is an energy-intensive sector of the economy. Energy is interlinked with all aspects of
agriculture, both directly as diesel fuel, electricity, and propane, and indirectly in energy-intensive
products such as fertilizer, other agricultural chemicals, and animal feed.
The large on-farm energy users include tillage, transportation, irrigation, inorganic fertilizers, petroleum
based pesticides, plastics and grain drying. There are a number important ways that the agricultural
sector and farming community can take to reduce both direct and indirect energy use. Fossil fuel
energy can be conserved on-farm by following certain practices such as:
- Reducing tillage operations
- Reducing trips to field
- Reducing fertilizer, pesticide and plastic inputs
- Conservative grain drying
- Irrigation use efficiency
- Recycling
- Substituting renewable energy for fossil fuels
These practices are already being applied to a certain extent and agriculture has already made
significant strides to mitigate GHGs (e.g., in programs supported by the USDA Natural Resource
Conservation Service). Efforts in this area can be increased considerably.
Many of these practices also conserve soil and water. Saving energy and water include measures
that reduce runoff, reduce chemical inputs, and reduce crop water requirement. Saving energy and
reducing crop fertilizer requirements involve use of crop rotations, cover crops, residue management
and manure management (Aschmann, S. 2005. Energy Savings through Cropping Systems. A Look
at the NRCS Energy Estimator. Presentation at the ACEEE Forum on Energy Efficiency in
Agriculture. November 2005).
Minimizing direct energy use and minimizing losses of soil, water, and farm chemicals (embodied
energy) are main thrusts of on-farm management for energy efficiency. Another key element of onfarm energy is photosynthetic energy that is the basis of agricultural/cropping processes. The aim
here would be optimizing photosynthetic energy for greater farm productivity and capturing carbon
through improved crop and soil management and related innovative technologies. Thus, agriculture
also has significant potential for enhancing the natural process of carbon sequestration [USDA 2004.
U.S. Agriculture and Forestry Greenhouse Gas Inventory: 1990-2001. Global Change Program Office,
Office of the Chief Economist, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Technical Bulletin No. 1907. March
2004]).
Creating carbon offsets in agriculture can be viable provided the projects are verified as meeting
appropriate criteria or standards (See General Accounting Office. 2008. CARBON OFFSETS The
U.S. Voluntary Market Is Growing, but Quality Assurance Poses Challenges for Market Participants).
The potential for creating carbon offsets in agriculture is most significant in three areas: a) increasing

102



the use of continuous conservation tillage; b) reducing the cultivation of organic soils; and c)
converting marginal cropland to permanent grassland or forest (Sampson, R. Neil. 2004. Potential for
Agricultural and Forestry Carbon Sequestration in the RGGI Region). Conversion from conventional
tillage to continuous conservation tillage is estimated to sequester carbon at rates equivalent to
around 0.1 tonne of carbon (tC) per acre per year or about 0.3 to 0.4 tonne of CO2 equivalent (see
USDA. 2004 above) to about 0.2 tC per acre per year or about 0.7 to 0.8 tCO2e per acre per year (Lal
et al. 1998. The Potential of U.S. Cropland to Sequester Carbon and Mitigate the Greenhouse Effect.
Chelsea, MI: Sleeping Bear Press)). The opportunity exists to encourage land use change that
significantly increases carbon sequestration, such as the conversion of cropland to permanent grass
or the conversion of cropland to forest. However, the primary competition for this land is development
so there needs to be significant incentives for landowners to convert land from agricultural use to
conservation or forest use instead of taking the high prices offered by developers. Natural Resource
Conservation Service (NRCS) incentive programs to retire marginal lands to grasslands are examples
of how to address this need.
Another aspect of agriculture that has GHG implications is livestock production. Livestock waste
currently contributes about 8 percent of human-related methane emissions in the country (USEPA.
2006. U.S. Emissions Inventory 2006: Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks:
1990 - 2004). In 2005, it was estimated that waste from just the nation's 9 million dairy cattle released
approximately 25 million metric tons (in CO2 equivalent) of methane (International Dairy Foods
Association [IDFA] webpage. 2007. Anaerobic digestion captures methane emissions from confined
animal waste. An average anaerobic digester that processes livestock manure waste can capture
methane and generate up to 2,900 megawatt-hours of electricity thereby potentially displacing
approximately 4,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent annually (Environmental Law and Policy Center.
2007. Measuring the Potential GHG Savings of the Farm Bill's Energy Title Programs). New Jersey
has a small livestock industry, particularly dairy, for which a centralized anaerobic digester system (for
animal waste disposal, energy production, and GHG reductions) might be considered. Potential
digester opportunities also exist for waste generated in the State’s equine industry.

Sustaining management of forestlands (private and public, beyond those that are
incorporated into the state lands program) to improve biomass carbon density, while
preserving important ecological co-benefits. By relying on conservation-based forest
management, which uses natural forest management or sustainable forest management
practices, including restocking of understocked areas/sites and forest stand improvement, and
depends on a combined management regime (active and passive forest management), the
State could increase forest growth and help accelerate storage of carbon, while continuing to
generate other important co-benefits.
Experiment with new roadside vegetation management strategies to improve air quality and
carbon sequestration. The NJDOT could work with the NJDEP to scope out a research
project to identify roadside plant materials and soils that have low maintenance costs
(mowing and landscape maintenance), ensure safety (clear zones and sight distances), and are
environmentally sound (mindful of wetlands, wildlife habitat, native plant species, etc.), but
that also provide improved air pollutant filtering and carbon sequestration.
Explore the viability of urban carbon sinks including development of a New Jersey Green
City or vacant land stabilization program. The State could explore the creation of a vacant
land stabilization program that would partner with municipalities to green and stabilize
vacant land and create urban/suburban forests and/or increase terrestrial carbon sequestration.
This could be modeled, in part, after a Pennsylvania Horticultural Society Program, whereby
community groups maintain the properties.

103

•

Research the potential for restoration of degraded soils to improve soil carbon density and
enhancement of marginal farmland into permanent terrestrial carbon sequestration. The
State could invest in research and demonstration projects to explore the conversion of
marginal farmland to permanent terrestrial carbon sequestration, including conversion for
grassland habitat for wildlife and/or conversion for growth of native, non-invasive species
such as switchgrass or other second generation biofuel stock as well use of biochar materials
for soil stabilization and fertilization. Depending on the type of vegetation to be introduced,
degraded soils of such farmland (soil groups D and E as identified by the State Farmland
Evaluation Advisory Committee) could be improved with measurable gains in soil carbon.
Reduce conversion of woodlands to agricultural uses on Soil Groups D and E. Rather than
losing mature woodlands to cultivated crops and other agricultural uses, the State could
implement one or more of the following options:
• Prevent land use conversions through the purchase of conservation easements requiring
land to stay in forest use.
• Use agro-forestry practices which combine agriculture and forestry technologies to create
more integrated, diverse, productive, profitable, healthy and sustainable land-use systems.
• Encourage property owners to participate in the NJDEP's Forest Stewardship Program.
• Prevent mature forest loss through legislative and/or regulatory reform.

Carbon storage is the absolute amount of carbon held within a carbon reservoir at a specified time (a
reservoir is a system capable of accumulating and releasing carbon, such as forest biomass).
Sequestration, on the other hand, is the uptake of carbon or the process of increasing the carbon
content of a carbon reservoir and is measured as a rate, i.e., mass per unit time (e.g., tons carbon per
year). Internationally, the measurement of terrestrial storage and sequestration is an emerging field.
The NJDEP is working with academic partners to quantify more accurately the sequestration capacity
of New Jersey forests (Lathrop, R. et. al. 2008. Assessing the Potential for New Jersey Forests to
Sequester Carbon and Contribute to Greenhouse Gas Emissions Avoidance. This is a research
project being conducted by Rutgers University in collaboration with the New Jersey Forest
Service/NJDEP). Additionally, other work is underway in New Jersey to better understand carbon
storage and sequestration. New Jersey is home to the USDA Silas Little Experimental Forest, one of
140 sites on five continents participating in FLUXNET, to quantify spatial and temporal variation in
carbon storage in plants and soils, and exchanges of carbon, water, and energy in major vegetation
types across a range of disturbance histories in the Americas. The carbon sequestration potential of
agriculture is discussed in the sidebar entitled “Energy/GHG Saving and Carbon Sequestration
Potential of Agriculture”. Data regarding the storage and sequestration potential of other vegetative
cover types is being synthesized by NJDEP. In the meantime, this report relies on preliminary
estimates from the New Jersey GHG Inventory and Reference Case Projections 1990-2020 (Technical
Appendix H of the Draft Inventory describes the estimation procedure for forestry and land-use. See
http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/pdf/20080219inventory.pdf).
Changes in carbon stocks and net GHG emissions over time can be estimated using some
combination of direct measurements, activity data (e.g., amount of forest products harvested; area of
forests/plantations), and models based on accepted principles of statistical analysis, forest inventory,
remote sensing techniques, flux measurements, soil sampling, and ecological surveys. Methods for
measuring non-CO2 GHG emissions are less well developed. It is important for emerging methods of
measuring terrestrial storage and sequestration to consider net GHG emissions results since some
activities designed to enhance CO2 storage may increase emissions of other highly warming gases
such as use of fertilizer to enhance tree growth (possible N2O emissions); wetland restoration

104



(possible increase in CH4 emissions); use of nitrogen fixing trees (possible increase in N2O
emissions); and use of biomass (wood and crops) as energy feedstock to offset CO2 emissions from
fossil fuels (possible increase in N2O emissions). As an evolving area, measurement of terrestrial
carbon sequestration includes different methods that entail assumptions and some level of uncertainty,
which need to be recognized.

In addition to these examples, there is a significant challenge in understanding the uncertainties
that are associated with vegetative resources. In particular, these include accounting for impacts
from unforeseen circumstances such as drought, fire or pest outbreaks that could have a profound
effect upon terrestrial vegetative resources as well as impacts to wetland resources from rising
sea level or coastal erosion from severe storms. The State recognizes it needs to establish
standards and indicators for long-term and more detailed terrestrial carbon sequestration
(vegetative biomass, soil, and long-lived wood-based products) accounting which includes
measurement and monitoring and ultimately allow for risk management to address the
uncertainties that vegetative systems face. Approaches can be land-cover based, programelement based, or carbon-cycle based.
Key Policy Area 4: Reduced Reliance on Cars
Comments received from stakeholders on the draft version of this report called for earlier action
on policies associated with integrating the statewide GHG limits into land use and transportation
planning. As a result, much of the discussion on land use and transportation planning from the
2050 section of the draft report has been moved to the 2020 supporting recommendations
outlined in Chapter 3. However, those 2020 supporting recommendations are clearly just the
beginning as New Jersey considers how to best undergo the long-term paradigm shift that will
result in land use patterns which will reduce reliance on cars to help achieve the statewide 2050
limit.
The transportation sector in New Jersey was responsible for about 35 percent of the State’s gross
GHG emissions in 2004, and approximately 30 percent of the total energy consumed in the State.
Transportation is not only the largest sector of New Jersey’s GHG emissions; it is also the fastest
growing sector. Figures 6.1 and 6.2 show the portion of petroleum consumed by New Jersey’s
transportation sector. 119

119

The transportation energy use and per capita data used to generate Figures 6.1 and 6.2 (as well as
Figure 6.3) are based on the total energy used by the transportation sector as reported by the
USDOE/EIA. New Jersey’s GHG inventory estimates for the transportation, presented in Chapter 2 of
this report, rely on a somewhat lower total energy use that does not include all of the jet fuel used in New
Jersey’s airports or the fuels used by the marine shipping sector. This lower total was used because
NJDEP recognizes that much of the use of these fuels is a result of national and international travel and
commerce, and is not under the direct control of New Jersey.

To date, the State’s ever-increasing consumption of energy from this sector has been attributed to
both: 1) the annual increase in the number of miles driven each year by New Jersey motorists
(known as vehicle miles traveled or VMT) since 1990 120 ; and 2) the fact that fuel efficiency
gains from cars over time have been negated by the increased use of light trucks (e.g., sport
utility vehicles). 121
In 2004, almost 73 billion vehicle miles 122 were traveled on the State's more than 38,000 miles of
roads 123 , ranking New Jersey 12th in the nation in terms of total vehicle miles traveled. Over
time, the rate of VMT increases in New Jersey has outpaced the rate of population growth. As
shown in Figure 6.4, VMT increased in New Jersey between 1992-2007 at approximately 1.7
percent per year 124 . Figure 6.5 shows a steady increase in VMT per person in the State, until
2007. The Urban Land Institute (ULI) reports that, since 1980, the number of miles Americans
drive has grown three times faster than population, and almost twice as fast as vehicle
registrations. According to ULI, sprawling development patterns are a key factor in that rate of

growth. 125 This pattern can be seen in New Jersey, where, between 1975 and 2005, the State’s
population increased by 20 percent while VMT increased by 50 percent. 126
Even though total VMT in New Jersey from 2007 to 2008 declined by approximately 3 percent,
it is likely that this decrease is related in part, to a 26 percent increase in gasoline prices during
the same period. If historic trends hold true, VMT declines associated with spikes in gasoline
prices will be reversed once gasoline prices drop.

The ULI warns that if sprawling development continues to fuel growth in driving, the projected
48 percent increase nationally in the total miles driven between 2005 and 2030 will overwhelm
expected gains from vehicle efficiency and low-carbon fuels. A 2008 study done by researchers
at Rowan University and Rutgers University 127 describes the changes to New Jersey’s landscape
between 1986 and 2002. The patterns in land development revealed that between 1986 and
1995, approximately 15,540 acres per year of farmland, forests and wetland were lost to
development. This pattern held for the period from 1995 to 2002, in which the annual net loss of
farmland, forests and wetlands was 15,676 acres.128 Additionally, as illustrated in Figure 6.6
below, over 600,000 acres of land were developed in New Jersey during the 29-year period from
1972 to 2001. This represents an increase of about 68 percent in the amount of developed land
in the State. 129 During this same period, population grew by only about 16 percent.

In a series of case studies illustrating how land use choices affect GHG emissions, a Rutgers
University professor posits that “while debates over global GHG emissions caps, national carbon
taxes, appliance and vehicle efficiency standards, and innovation policy play out, local planners
can get to work on their part of the program.” 130
Recent data appear to indicate that the current downturn in the economy has slowed the national
mobility rate to historically low levels. 131 However, there are no data to suggest that New
Jersey’s sprawling land use patterns of the past two decades are permanently reversing. Rather
than seeing a sustained reversal of growth to cities and towns, it would appear that the current
economic climate is making relocation an economically unfeasible option. Urban residents are
appearing to “stay put” rather than relocate to sprawling new developments. Additionally, while
New Jersey’s cities, towns and boroughs are starting to catch up to the statewide growth rate, that
indicator does not translate to the end of a long-term trend of sprawling land use patterns. New
Jersey’s fastest growing townships over the past eight years - Woolwich, Upper Freehold,
Mansfield, Lopatcong, and Barnegat - all continued to outpace the statewide growth rate
between 2007 and 2008, in some cases significantly so. 132 First-place Woolwich's 2007-08
population growth rate was more than 8 times the state rate. Using land use/land cover data from

2002 133 to estimate each municipality's build-out percentage, New Jersey Future found that of
the 20 fastest-growing municipalities in New Jersey over the 2007-08 time period, 16 of them
were more than 50 percent built-out, and 11 of them were more than 80 percent built-out. This is
a change from earlier this decade; for the period 2000-2008 only 6 municipalities are among the
top 20 fastest-growing (at least 50 percent built-out), and none of them being 80 percent built-out
or more. 134
While possibly less than in years past, that trend is still steady and is still dependent on
consuming a proportionally larger share of undeveloped land as compared to compact and
transit-oriented development. Overall the long-term statewide trend continues to point to a
strong signal in New Jersey that sprawl is still a sustained land use pattern in the Garden State
not only in terms of stretching out to locations with little or no existing infrastructure as well as
in terms of being contrary to compact development in cities, towns and villages. A recent
Lincoln Land Institute 135 study on the effectiveness of state's smart growth efforts supports this
finding: "The population density in 2000 of New Jersey’s newly urbanized territory (the land
developed between 1990 and 2000) lagged all the other states except Indiana. This stands in
marked contrast to the density of the state’s already urbanized territory, which in 1990 was the
highest of all eight states in the study. The inescapable conclusion: While the Garden State starts
with certain historical advantages in terms of compact development, new suburban development
here has looked a lot like — and maybe even less dense than — new suburban development
elsewhere."
Equally as important, in terms of climate change, to the number of vehicle miles accumulated in
the State is the number of individuals in each vehicle. Private automobiles remain the most
commonly used mode of travel for people living in the United States, and this is true for New
Jersey residents as well. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, most New Jersey
workers (71.8 percent) drive alone to work. 136 While this rate is lower than that of most U.S.
workers, including those workers living in Pennsylvania and Connecticut, it is higher than that of
workers living in New York State. Slightly over 10 percent of New Jersey workers take public
transportation to work, while 9.2 percent carpool, 3.2 percent walk to work and 3.3 percent work
at home. 137
New Jersey operates one of the largest public transit agencies in the country, providing regional
rail service, light rail service (Hudson-Bergen, River Line, and Newark Light Rail lines), and bus
service throughout the State. Other providers operating transit service in New Jersey include the
Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the Port Authority Transit Corporation of
Pennsylvania. While this system is impressive, its focus on the central core of the State from
New York to Philadelphia leaves room for improvement. This is evident from statistics from the

2000 Census, which show that while 70.6 percent of New Jerseyeans working in Manhattan took
public transportation to work, as did 24 percent of those who worked in Philadelphia, only 5
percent of people who worked in New Jersey used transit to get to work. 138 These data are
complemented by recent research from New Jersey Future which indicates that “in 1980, two out
of three employed New Jersey residents (65.3 percent) drove to work alone; by 2000, it was three
out of four (75.1 percent).” 139 The same New Jersey Future report indicates that the number of
New Jerseyeans carpooling to work decreased from 18.6 percent in 1980 to 10.9 percent in
2000. 140
In summary, New Jerseyeans consume significant amounts of higher carbon intensity petroleum,
due to their reliance on cars as their preferred mode of transportation. Reliance on higher carbon
intensity fuels, cars and distance to daily activities need to be directly addressed in order for the
State to reach its statewide 2050 GHG limit. There is a need for a public discussion on largerterm transportation and land use policies that will contribute to attainment of the 2050 statewide
GHG limit.
Independent Research Panel
The State recognizes the need to make the paradigm shift to transforming its economy as a
fundamental lever to achieving the 2050 limits, having identified four key policies to focus on as
most essential to achieve the 2050 limits. The Global Warming Response Act directs the NJDEP
in cooperation with other State agencies to “prepare a report [by 2010] recommending the
measures necessary to reduce GHG emissions to achieve the 2050 limit.” Development of
recommendations to achieve the 2050 limit can greatly benefit from specific expertise and
informed judgment. Recognizing such, the Global Warming Response Act also provides for
creation of an Independent Research Panel (IRP) to evaluate the recommendations and provide
an assessment of the ecological, economic and social impacts that may result. The panel can
play an important role in guiding the State towards development of specific actions to achieve
the State’s long-term GHG limits in ways that promote economic prosperity and improve quality
of life for New Jerseyeans. To that end, the deliberations of the IRP can address the four key
policy areas identified herein from both a macro-perspective while also addressing issues on a
micro-scale. Among other things that can be considered, the IRP can:
•
•
•
•
•

Provide recommendations to the State for meeting the initial set of long-term indicators;
Explore policy options for pricing mechanisms that incentivize development of climatefriendly markets;
Establish emissions targets for the transportation sector;
Assist in assessing uncertainty in vegetative systems with respect to terrestrial sequestration
measurement; and
Provide recommendations regarding how to best take advantage of the voluntary offset
market in New Jersey while providing for discrete, rigorous and verifiable standards that will
ensure real GHG reductions while providing consumer protection for offset purchases.

Next Steps
This report lays out a significant public policy agenda that affects many sectors of New Jersey’s
economy. The path ahead for New Jersey to achieve its statewide greenhouse gas limits is
challenging. Delay is not an option. It is this generation – not the next – that is already
beginning to face pressing and economically devastating effects of climate change, with the
Northeast expected to be particularly affected. With continued action, the benefits to
transforming the state’s economy to one based on energy efficiency, conservation and clean
technologies are significant.
Moving forward demands leadership, consensus building, vision and persistence. In general, this
report provides a template reflecting significant stakeholder input and unique collaboration
among many state agencies. In essence, this report serves as a blueprint for the State to move
forward in key areas including regulation, education, stakeholder engagement, research and clean
energy market development. Additionally, the State has yet to tap the voluntary offset market
which, if addressed through discrete, rigorous and verifiable standards and protocols, offers
promise for emission reductions and investment in clean technologies. Issuance of this report is
an important step in New Jersey’s path to attainment of its statewide limits, and its release is
certain to engender important dialogue in moving forward. The Global Warming Response Act
contemplated a collaborative process for New Jersey moving forward in the form of an
Independent Research Panel (IRP) which is intended to engender an informed dialogue to assist
the State in attaining its 2020 and 2050 limits. With continued dialogue and leadership, New
Jersey can fulfill the promise of sustainable development with a strong economy and a clean
environment for this generation and generations to come.

Appendix 1

Anticipated Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions Expected by 2020 from the
Core Recommendations



As discussed in Chapter 2 of the State’s final Global Warming Response Act Recommendation
Report (hereafter referred to as the main report) three core recommendations, if fully successful
and fully implemented on schedule, would enable the State to meet the statutory 2020 limit.
1. Much of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction necessary to meet the statewide
2020 GHG limit is expected to be accomplished through the implementation of New
Jersey’s Energy Master Plan (EMP). The chief goals of the EMP are to reduce projected
energy use by 20 percent by 2020 and meet 22.5 percent of the State's electric needs with
renewable energy sources by 2020. Based on the data and analysis in the EMP, this can
be achieved with a combination of energy efficiency, conservation, and renewable energy
resources.
2. New Jersey has implemented a cap-and-trade program developed through the
Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic States’ Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) that
imposes a cap on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by electricity producers in the region.
Specifically, RGGI caps regional power plant emissions at approximately current levels
from 2009 through 2014 and then reduces those emissions 10 percent by 2018.
3. The State has adopted a Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) Program modeled after the
California program. This program requires automakers to reduce fleetwide GHG
emissions from the vehicles they sell in New Jersey 30 percent by 2016.
These 3 measures are listed and briefly described, and their approximate expected emission
reductions are quantified, in Table A1.1. Note that these estimates are preliminary, and are
subject to revision based on additional input. The total reduction, if all reductions shown in the
table are fully successful and fully implemented on schedule, is approximately 38 million metric
tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) below the estimated business-as-usual
emission of 154 MMT CO2eq. This reduction would result in statewide emissions of 116 MMT
CO2eq by 2020, which would allow the State to meet its Statewide 2020 limit of 123 MMT
CO2eq, (the estimated 1990 emission levels).
Additional reductions could be achieved by extending energy efficiency measures and
implementing the other measures outlined in Chapter 3 of the main report. Long-term emission
reductions sufficient to meet the 2050 limit, which is 80 percent below the 2006 GHG emissions
level, will require more far-reaching measures. 1

1

The estimated reductions in this Appendix are based on the State’s first GHG inventory, which analyzed
2004 emissions. The state has completed the GHG inventory estimates for 2005, 2006 and 2007. Data
show that differences between the 2004 and 2007 totals are not significant enough to warrant
recalculation of the reduction estimates in this Appendix. The inventory reports are available at
http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/.

Discussion

RGGI

RGGI caps carbon dioxide emissions from electricity producers in the
region. Reductions attributable to RGGI are difficult to quantify at a
statewide level because the RGGI limits are regional. For the purpose
of estimating anticipated reductions by 2020, the emissions from NJ
facilities covered by RGGI are considered to be equal to NJ's share of
the total emission reductions attributable to RGGI.
The EMP relies on many approaches to reduce energy use and to
expand the State’s renewable generation capacity. Measures include a
Renewable Portfolio Standard (already in place), additional use of
biofuels, and a variety of efficiency measures for existing and new
buildings. Renewable energy sources are expected to generate over
18,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) of NJ’s electricity by 2020, including
over 2000 GWh from solar, over 6,700 GWh from biomass, and over
9,500 GWh from wind. This electricity is projected to come from
growth in all renewable sectors, including development of offshore
wind to a total of 3,000 megawatts capacity. It is assumed for this
analysis that GHG emissions from wind and solar are essentially zero,
and that emissions from biomass sources are equal to those from the
combustion of biodiesel. A number of efforts are expected to result in
increased energy efficiency. One effort is the expansion of capacity of
on-site generation, which is expected to be based largely on combined
heat and power units. On-site generation is expected to produce over
12,000 GWh per year of electricity by 2020. In addition to supplying
electricity, combined heat and power units translate waste heat to
useable thermal energy, which can displace fossil fuels. The EMP
projects that, because of expanded renewable capacity and energy
efficiency measures, the State will be a net exporter of electricity by
2020. Exported electricity has been factored into the total emissions
quantity as a negative number, and would theoretically be balanced by
additional emissions representing imported electricity into another
state's inventory. The interrelationship of RGGI limits and projected
exported electricity cannot be estimated with precision without
knowing the state to which that electricity is exported, which is
uncertain at this time.

This reduction could be further increased if the following are taken into account: (a) reductions due to
additional terrestrial sequestration (estimated at about 270,000 metric tons CO2 annually) resulting from
investment of RGGI auction proceeds on strategic management of state lands for forest and tidal marsh
stewardship and restoration; (b) GHG reductions from energy efficiency, renewable energy and combined
heat and power projects in the commercial, institutional, and industrial sectors, also funded by RGGI
through the Economic Development Authority; and (c) GHG emissions reduction, avoided emissions, and
carbon sequestration from local government grant projects likewise supported by RGGI proceeds
(through the NJDEP) as directed by the Global Warming Solutions Fund law (N.J.S.A. 26:2C-50 et.seq.).

LEV

The State implemented the New Jersey Low Emission Vehicle Program
in 2009. This program, modeled after the California Low Emission
Vehicle Program, requires automakers to reduce fleet-wide greenhouse
gas emissions from the vehicles they sell in NJ 30 percent by 2016.
Assuming that 1) VMT growth in the State will be in the range of 1
percent per year until 2020, and 2) NJ residents continue to acquire new
vehicles at the current pace, overall GHGs emissions from the motor
vehicle fleet are expected to be reduced by approximately 22 percent
below what they otherwise would be by 2020.

As discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 of the main report, a federal motor vehicle control program was
jointly proposed by the USEPA and the U.S. Department of Transportation on September 28, 2009. This
federal rulemaking, if adopted, will be different than the State’s Low Emission Vehicle Program. The
State is in the process of evaluating the impact of the federal program on the State’s assumptions
regarding greenhouse gas reductions from new motor vehicle initiatives.

Re:

Low Emission Vehicle Model Results

New Jersey is implementing California’s Low Emission Vehicle II (LEV)
standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars and light duty
vehicles. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection solicited the
Center for Energy, Economic & Environmental Policy and Rutgers Economic
Advisory Service to assess the economic impacts of the LEV standards, similar to
California’s, in New Jersey.
R/ECON Model
R/ECON™ is an econometric model comprised of over 300 equations, based on
historical data for New Jersey and the United States, which are solved
simultaneously. The historical data covers the period from 1970 to 2006, with
some updated through 2007. The following sectors are included in the model:
¾ Employment and gross state product for 40 industries;
¾ Wage rates and price deflators for major industries;
¾ Consumer price index;
¾ Personal income and its components;
¾ Population, labor force and unemployment;
¾ Housing permits, construction contracts, and housing prices and sales;
¾ Energy prices and usage;
¾ Motor vehicle registrations and stocks;
¾ State tax revenues by type of tax, and current and capital expenditures.
The heart of the model is a set of equations modeling employment, wages, and
prices by industry. In general, employment in an industry depends on demand for
that industry’s output and the state’s wages and prices relative to the nation’s.
Demand can be represented by a variety of variables including (but not limited to)
New Jersey personal income, population, sectoral output, or U.S. employment in

1



the sector. The data for the U.S. comes from Global Insight, Inc., a national leader
in economic forecasting.
R/ECON Model and the New Jersey Energy Master Plan
R/ECON™ was used to model the macroeconomic effects of New Jersey’s
Energy Master Plan (EMP) initiatives, using Business as Usual and Alternative
Scenarios under different fuel price scenarios. As a part of the EMP modeling, the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative was utilized as the carbon dioxide policy for
2010 and 2015 and a national carbon dioxide policy was used for 2020.
R/ECON™ does not account for environmental externalities and therefore
understates the positive economic impacts of emission reductions. As
demonstrated by the R/ECON™ simulations, the economic effects of the EMP
were negligible when the environmental benefits of the Energy Master Plan were
not accounted for.
R/ECON Model and Low Emission Vehicles
The effects of implementing California LEV standards were also modeled using
R/ECON™. Building on the previous EMP work, the assumptions and inputs
used for the EMP Business as Usual and Alternative Scenarios were used as a
baseline for the LEV simulations. Additional LEV-specific input data were used
in conjunction with EMP data.
The model inputs were calculated using the incremental costs of passenger cars
and light duty vehicles from NESCAUM’s Northeast State GHG Emission
Reduction Potential from Adoption of the California Motor Vehicle GHG
Standards. 1 California’s LEV greenhouse gas emissions standards for carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons leakage from air
conditioning systems result in an increase in the cost of passenger cars and light
duty vehicles. For modeling purposes, it was assumed that the LEV standards
would be implemented in New Jersey on January 1, 2010.
Models
Four R/ECON™ simulations were run to determine the effects of California’s
Low Emission Vehicle greenhouse gas standards in New Jersey.
1. The Business as Usual Scenario (BAU);
2. The Business as Usual Scenario with the Low Emission Vehicle policy
adders;
3. The EMP Scenario;
4. The EMP Scenario with the Low Emission Vehicle policy adders.

R/ECON™ Results
Based on a comparison of the EMP and the EMP with LEV model results in 2020,
an LEV standard would have minimal impact on the economy before accounting
for the economic benefits of lower environmental emissions. A few of the impacts
include:
¾ New light duty truck and van registrations will decrease by 0.4%;
¾ Retail sales will decrease 1.6%;
¾ Gross State Product will decrease 0.3%;
¾ Vehicle miles traveled will decrease by 0.02%.

Appendix 3
New Jersey Accomplishments and Ongoing Efforts with Respect to
Greenhouse Gas Legislation, Regulations, Policies and Programs



Through enactment of Executive Order 54, the Global Warming Response Act (GWRA), and the
Global Warming Solutions Fund Act (GWSF), the State has the direction and the vital tools
necessary for addressing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in and from New Jersey. In addition
to moving forward with its core 2020 recommendations (implementation of the Energy Master
Plan (EMP), Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV)
program), the various State government agencies have made commitments and achievements to
reduce New Jersey’s impact on global warming, and are currently working to implement still
more actions. This appendix highlights the State’s GHG accomplishments to date, and gives the
status of those in progress.
I.

Establishing GHG Reduction Goals

The overarching GHG reduction goals for New Jersey were first established by Executive Order
54, and then expanded through the GWRA.
Executive Order 54
On February 13, 2007, Executive Order 54 was issued. The Executive Order, recognizing the
devastating economic and environmental impact that global warming, if unchecked, could have
on New Jersey, set ambitious goals for GHG reductions in New Jersey. Specifically, Executive
Order 54 sets statewide limits to reduce GHG emissions designed to stabilize New Jersey’s GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and reduce statewide GHG emissions 80 percent below 2006
levels by 2050. In addition to establishing statewide GHG reduction limits, Executive Order 54
directs the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to develop a statewide
inventory of GHG emissions and to evaluate policies to achieve the Statewide 2020 and 2050
emissions reduction limits.
Global Warming Response Act
On July 6, 2007, the GWRA put into law the statewide GHG limits established by Executive
Order 54. In addition, the GWRA requires, among other things, that:
1. The NJDEP will establish an inventory of the current and 2006 Statewide GHG
emissions, and an inventory of the 1990 level of Statewide GHG emissions. The NJDEP
has completed this task. This initial inventory, as well as the updated inventory for 2005,
2006 and 2007, released November 9, 2009, can be found at
http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/index.shtml.
2. The NJDEP will adopt rules establishing a GHG emissions monitoring and reporting
program for statewide GHG emissions. Specifically, these rules would require the
identification of all significant sources of GHG emissions in the State (including but not
limited to fossil fuel usage, electrical generation, and gas public utilities), and the
monitoring and reporting of emissions from those sources and changes in emissions over
time from those sources. These rules will allow the State to monitor its progress toward
meeting the Statewide 2020 and 2050 GHG limits. See Section IV below for information
on the status of this rulemaking.

1



3. The NJDEP, in consultation with the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (NJBPU), the
New Jersey Department of Agriculture (NJDA), the New Jersey Department of
Transportation (NJDOT), and the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs
(NJDCA), will prepare a report outlining specific recommendations for legislative and
regulatory action needed to achieve the 2020 GHG limit. The State’s final GWRA
Recommendation Report satisfies this GWRA requirement. Subsequently, the NJDEP, in
cooperation with any other affected State agencies, will prepare a second report outlining
specific recommendations for legislative and regulatory action needed to achieve the
2050 GHG limit.
4. The EMP, required by N.J.S.A. 52:27F-14, will include a list of recommended policies and
measures to reduce the GHG emissions from the production, processing, distribution,
transmission, storage, or use of energy that will contribute to achieving the 2020 GHG
limit. On October 22, 2008, the NJBPU released the final EMP, which can be found at
http://nj.gov/emp/.
5. The NJDEP, by no later than January 1, 2009, and biennially thereafter, will prepare a
report on the status of its GHG emissions monitoring and reporting program, the current
level of GHG emissions in the State and the progress made toward compliance with the
2020 and 2050 GHG limits. The report will also include updated and comparative
inventories of statewide GHG emissions. NJDEP has completed this task. The report,
entitled “New Jersey Statewide Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Update: 2005,
2006, and 2007 Estimates,” can be found at http://www.nj.gov/globalwarming/.
6. The NJDEP, by no later than January 1, 2015, will evaluate the ecological, economic, and
environmental factors and the technological capability affecting the attainment or
maintenance of the 2020 and 2050 GHG limits.
7. The NJDEP will designate an independent research panel consisting of economists,
business managers, nonprofit environmental organization representatives, public officials,
and scientists from academia, industry and the government, to review its
recommendations and evaluations. This research panel will complete its review within
12 months of the date of transmittal of the NJDEP’s GWRA Recommendation Report to
the Governor and State legislature, and will prepare and transmit its own report
evaluating the ecological, economic and social impact of the proposed recommendations.
8. The NJBPU is authorized to develop an Emissions Portfolio Standard (EPS) to address
pollution coming from out-of-state sources of electricity and an Energy Efficiency
Portfolio Standard (EEPS) to specify energy efficiency requirements in existing building
stock that utilities would have to achieve.

II.

Global Warming Solutions Fund Act

On January 13, 2008, the Global Warming Solutions Fund Act (GWSF) was enacted. The
GWSF legislation authorizes the auction of allowances under RGGI, a ten-state mandatory
carbon dioxide (CO2) cap and trade program for electric generating units above 25 megawatts.
The legislation establishes, through the Department of the Treasury, a special, non-lapsing fund
known as the Global Warming Solutions Fund. The GWSF dedicates to consumer benefit
purposes up to 100 percent of the revenues derived from the auction or other sale of allowances
pursuant to RGGI, and stipulates that these monies be delegated to State agencies as follows:
•

•

•

Sixty percent of the proceeds to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority
(NJEDA) to support end use energy efficiency, renewable energy, and combined heat
and power (CHP) production and to develop innovative carbon abatement
technologies to focus on reaching the 2020 GHG limit;
Twenty percent of the proceeds to the NJBPU to fund programs to reduce electricity
demand or cost to low and moderate income customers. The focus for these proceeds
would be on urban areas, including an effort to address urban heat island effects;
Twenty percent of the proceeds to NJDEP, with half of that allocation dedicated to
support programs designed to promote local government efforts to reduce GHG
emissions and the remaining half dedicated to investments in forestry and tidal marsh
protection to maximize carbon sequestration.

The GWSF further directs the NJDEP, in consultation with the NJBPU and the NJEDA, to adopt
guidelines and a priority ranking system for allocation of the funds, and sets forth evaluation
criteria that need to be included in those guidelines and the priority ranking system. See Section
IV below for information about the status of this rulemaking.
The GWSF also provides that all electric public utility and gas public utility investment in
energy efficiency and conservations programs or Class 1 renewable energy programs 1 may be
eligible for rate treatment approved by the NJBPU, including a return on equity, or other
incentives or rate mechanism that decouple utility revenue from sales of electricity and gas.
Finally, the GWSF directs the NJBPU to undertake an EPS or other measure to mitigate the
impact from “leakage” (increased imports from non-RGGI states) and authorizes the NJBPU to
develop an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard. Electric and gas utilities have begun
submitting plans for utility investment in energy efficiency and conservation programs, and
Class 1 renewable energy programs to the Board of Public Utilities for approval. The NJBPU
has convened a series of stakeholder meetings to discuss methods for mitigating potential
“leakage” impacts related to RGGI implementation. The RGGI-participating states funded a
study of leakage mitigation measures. The final report, issued in 2008, recommends an
expansion of energy efficiency initiatives in the RGGI states as a primary means of addressing
the impact of leakage. The report, “Potential Emissions Leakage and the Regional Greenhouse
Gas Initiative (RGGI),” is available at http://www.rggi.org/docs/20080331leakage.pdf.
1

"Class 1” renewable energy is defined as electricity derived from solar energy, wind energy, wave or
tidal action, geothermal energy, landfill gas, anaerobic digestion, fuel cells using renewable fuels and,
with written permission of the NJDEP, certain forms of sustainable biomass.

New Jersey Accomplishments

This section provides an overview of New Jersey’s accomplishments to date to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
Renewable Portfolio Standard
A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) ensures that a minimum amount of renewable energy is
included in the portfolio of electricity resources serving a state. By increasing that required
amount over time, the RPS can put the electricity industry on a path toward increasing
sustainability. In New Jersey, pursuant to the provisions of the Electric Discount and Energy
Competition Act (P.L. 1999, c. 23), each electric power supplier or basic generation service
provider serving retail customers in the State is required to include in its power portfolio
electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The State’s original RPS directive has
been modified several times since 1999. Prior to the changes made in 2006, New Jersey's RPS
required electricity suppliers to acquire 6.5 percent renewable energy.
In April 2006, the NJBPU adopted rules which expanded the State’s RPS by extending the
existing goals out to 2020 and increasing the required amount of renewable energy, with a
separate requirement for solar energy. Specifically, under these regulations, 22.5 percent of New
Jersey’s electricity must come from renewable sources by 2020, with a requirement that 2.12
percent of the renewable sources requirement be from solar energy. This “solar set aside” is
forecast to require between 1,400 and 1,500 megawatts (MW) of new solar generation capacity,
the Nation’s largest solar commitment relative to population and electricity use. These rules will
increase the use of renewable resources, thereby providing greater fuel diversity for New Jersey
while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions, diminishing price volatility, strengthening the
economy, and improving public health and our environment.
CO2 as a Pollutant
In November 2005, New Jersey adopted a regulation under the authority of New Jersey’s Air
Pollution Control Act to classify CO2 as an air contaminant. The adoption was published in the
New Jersey Register on November 21, 2005. This rule enabled the State to implement its
responsibilities under RGGI and to enact additional rules to reduce CO2 emissions from other
sectors as necessary. Prior to this, in 2003 New Jersey added CO2 and methane to its emission
statement program reporting requirements. The emission statement program requires the annual
reporting of emissions of 50 air contaminants from approximately 600 of the largest stationary
sources of air pollution in New Jersey.
International Carbon Action Partnership
On October 29, 2007, New Jersey joined the other members of the RGGI, and the members of
the Western Climate Initiative, as well as European Union member states, the European
Commission, New Zealand and Norway (the latter two both joining on behalf of their own
emissions trading programs) in forming the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP).
ICAP is an international forum in which governments and public authorities adopting mandatory

4



GHG emission cap and trade systems, like RGGI, can share experiences and best practices on the
design of these emissions trading schemes. This cooperation will ensure that the programs are
compatible and are able to work together as the foundation for a global carbon market. Such a
market will boost demand for low carbon products and services, promote innovation, and allow
cost effective reductions, which ultimately will allow ambitious global reductions in global
warming emissions.
New Jersey's Clean Energy Program
In 2003, the NJBPU established the Office of Clean Energy to administer New Jersey's Clean
Energy Program (NJCEP). The NJCEP is a ratepayer-funded program which promotes increased
energy efficiency and the use of clean, renewable sources of energy, including solar, wind,
geothermal, and sustainable biomass, by offering financial incentives, and provides assistance
services for residential, commercial, and municipal customers. Also in 2003, representatives
from government, business, environmental, and public advocacy organizations helped the
NJBPU establish a Clean Energy Council to engage stakeholders in the NJCEP's development
and provide input to the NJBPU regarding the design, budgets, objectives, goals, administration,
and evaluation of the NJCEP. Today, NJCEP is recognized as a national model for programs
that spur market development and adoption of clean, renewable energy technologies; manage
programs to encourage energy efficiency; and assist low-income consumers. The NJCEP offers
the following programs that make clean energy technologies affordable and accessible to
residential customers, businesses, schools and local governments:
•

Residential Energy Efficiency & Assistance Programs: A suite of programs designed to
assist homeowners to improve residential energy efficiency, including: energy audits and
efficiency improvement recommendations; incentives for energy-efficient construction in
Smart Growth Areas; consumer education about the federal ENERGY STAR® program; aid
to income-eligible households; and rebates for energy efficient heating and cooling
equipment.

•

Commercial Clean Energy Programs: A series of programs to support businesses, schools
and governments, including:
o The New Jersey SmartStart Buildings Program, which enables energy efficiency
upgrades for new and existing buildings;
o Incentives to increase industrial energy efficiency by utilizing the waste heat
generated by manufacturing processes; and,
o Financing programs, including incentives and low-interest loans to small businesses,
schools and local governments.

•

Renewable Energy Programs: Several assistance and incentive programs designed to
increase the use of renewable energy technologies in New Jersey, including:
o a rebate program to reduce up-front purchase and installation costs for solar, small
wind and sustainable biomass (e.g., plants-to-energy) systems;
o support to owners and sellers of Solar Renewable Energy Certificates, a marketable
commodity;

5



o

the CleanPower Choice Program, which enables voluntary purchases of green energy
through local electric utilities;
o renewable energy project grants and financing for larger projects as well as grants for
commercializing new technologies in partnership with the NJEDA; and
o technical and financial assistance for clean energy businesses.

The Table below summarizes the annual and projected lifetime emission reductions that
result from the installation of energy efficiency and renewable energy measures installed in
2008, and projected cumulative emission reductions from measures installed from 2001 2008.

b

Other Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Programs:
•

NJDEP Regulations Supporting Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency: The
NJDEP’s rules require that major new sources of air pollution complete an evaluation of
alternatives for non-attainment criteria pollutants, including oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and
fine particles emitted by fossil fuel fired plants and heaters. Pursuant to NJAC7:2718.3(c)(2), alternative sizes, production processes (including pollution prevention measures)
and environmental control techniques must be evaluated, demonstrating that the benefits of
the project significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as result of the
location and operation of such equipment. This is particularly relevant in the evaluation of
new coal-fired power plants.

6



In 2007, New Jersey adopted NOx rules to allocate NOx allowances in response to the Ozone
Transport Commission NOx Memorandum of Understanding and subsequent federal NOx
State Implementation Plan Call to allow its emission trading program to promote energy
efficiency. Specifically, these output-based allocations are based on energy produced, rather
than being input-based allocations based on fuel burned. This program also has a set aside
allocation for energy efficiency and renewable projects.
•

New Jersey Cool Cities Initiative: As a result of research conducted by the NJDEP and the
USEPA on urban heat island effects in Camden and Newark, New Jersey launched its Cool
Cities Initiative in 2003. This program is designed to “green” New Jersey’s larger cities by
planting trees to create cooler, more comfortable urban environments, reduce air pollution,
reduce the demand for electricity, and improve urban quality of life. The total Cool Cities
funding from the NJCEP (including the NJBPU/NJDEP current 2009 Memorandum of
Agreement funding commitment) to date is $16,850,000, resulting in the planting of over
36,000 trees. The program has or will work in 54 communities directly, and has worked with
another 50 communities in 2006/2007 through the Statewide Cool Cities Grant program.
The Cool Cites Initiative has provided the NJBPU with data concerning the conservation of
energy through the tree planting effort. In addition, communities have provided positive
feedback to the State regarding the Cool Cities partnerships. In fact, many communities have
established a Community Forestry Management plan to not only manage the Cool Cities
trees but the entire urban forest within their municipalities.

•

State Government Action to Promote Energy Efficiency: On April 22, 2006 Executive
Order #11 was enacted. This Executive Order was designed to promote energy efficiency,
energy conservation, renewable energy, and the purchase by State government of recycled
products, energy efficient products, renewable energy products, low toxicity products and
alternatives to products that contain persistent bioaccumulative toxics. Executive Order #11
also created the post of Director of Energy Savings within the New Jersey Department of
Treasury to oversee these new State government energy initiatives.

•

New Jersey Green Homes Office: The NJDCA Green Homes Office works to increase the
use of innovative green design and building technologies, raise building standards and create
a consumer demand for efficient, healthy and environmentally responsible high-performance
homes. This Office’s primary focus is on energy efficiency.

Status of GHG-Related Rulemakings

Reporting Rule
As discussed above, the GWRA requires the NJDEP to adopt GHG monitoring and reporting
rules. The NJDEP held a stakeholder meeting on May 13, 2008 to outline approaches to this
rulemaking and obtain stakeholder input. On January 20, 2009, the NJDEP proposed a rule 2
requiring: (1) reporting of releases by stationary sources of GHG other than CO2 above a
threshold of 2,500 tons per year; (2) reporting of fossil fuel use by manufacturers and distributors
of fossil fuel, including prime suppliers, gas public utilities, and natural gas pipeline operators;
and (3) reporting of storage quantities of GHG other than CO2 and methane above threshold
quantities. These proposed reporting requirements will be implemented through existing
reporting mechanisms, with releases by stationary sources implemented through the Emission
Statement program and reporting of fossil fuel use and quantities of GHG stored implemented
through New Jersey’s Worker and Community Right to Know program. A hearing on this rule
proposal was held on March 3, 2009, and the comment period ended on March 21, 2009.
On April 10, 2009, the USEPA proposed rules establishing a federal mandatory GHG reporting
program. 3 The NJDEP provided comments on the proposal urging the USEPA to coordinate
with state GHG reporting requirements to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of future
reporting. The final EPA rule appeared in the Federal Register on October 30, 2009. 4 NJDEP
reviewed the final rule and has determined that it does not cover all of the requirements of the
State monitoring and reporting program mandated by the GWRA. NJDEP is currently planning
to adopt the State’s rules to fill the gaps in reporting and to meet the State’s requirements.
Priority Ranking Rule
As discussed above, the GWSF law requires the NJDEP, in consultation with the NJBPU and the
NJEDA, to adopt guidelines and a priority ranking system to assist in annual allocation of funds
to eligible projects or programs using GWSF monies, and sets forth evaluation criteria that must
be included in those guidelines and the priority ranking system. Specifically, these guidelines
and priority ranking system should include, but need not be limited to, an evaluation of each
eligible project or program as to its predicted ability to:
• result in a net reduction in GHG emissions in the State or in GHG emissions from
electricity produced out of the State but consumed in the State or net sequestration of
carbon;
• result in significant reductions in GHGs relative to the cost of the project or program
and the reduction of impacts on ratepayers attributable to the implementation of the
GWSF, and the ability of the project or program to significantly contribute to
achievement of the State’s 2020 and 2050 GHG limits established pursuant to the
GWRA, relative to the cost of the project or program;
• reduce energy use;

provide co-benefits to the State, including but not limited to creating job
opportunities, reducing other air pollutants, reducing costs to electricity and natural
gas consumers, improving local electric system reliability, and contributing to
regional initiatives to reduce emissions; and
be directly responsive to the recommendations submitted by the NJDEP to the
Legislature as part of this report.

On February 17, 2009, the NJDEP proposed rules 5 to meet this requirement. A public hearing
on this rule proposal was held on March 23, 2009, and the public comment period closed on
April 18, 2009. The rule is expected to be published in the New Jersey Register on December
21, 2009.
In addition to its leadership role in efforts to reduce GHG emissions regionally through RGGI,
New Jersey continues to be very active in advocating for national and international efforts to
reduce GHGs. For example, New Jersey has participated upon request in Congressional hearings
and in national meetings regarding state and local perspectives on climate change.
In addition:
•

On October 29, 2007, New Jersey became a founding member of the International Carbon
Action Partnership (ICAP). For more information on ICAP, refer to Section III above; and
New Jersey is a member of The Climate Registry (TCR), and sits on the organization’s Board
of Directors. TCR is a voluntary greenhouse gas reporting platform that allows organizations
in North America to report their entity-wide greenhouse gas emissions. NJDEP participates
in TCR’s Protocol Committee, and played a leadership role in the development of the TCR
General Reporting Protocol for organizational greenhouse gas reporting. More information
is available at http://www.theclimateregistry.org.

Appendix 4

Activities in Other States



Given the enormity of the climate change problem, many states have recognized that each region
within a country must do its part to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions if we are to avert
the most devastating impacts from global warming, and have begun to take action.
State initiatives serve as models for subsequent federal action, similar to what has already
happened with other environmental regulations, where a significant number of federal
environmental laws and programs have been based on state models. State actions can have a
significant impact on emissions, because many individual states emit relatively high levels of
GHGs. Texas, for example, emits more GHGs than France, while California’s emissions exceed
those of Brazil. New Jersey accounts for approximately 0.5 percent of the global GHG
emissions, and 2 percent of the U.S. GHG emissions. 1 State actions are also important because
states have primary or substantial jurisdiction over many areas, such as agriculture,
transportation, building codes and land use, which are critical to addressing climate change. By
taking a proactive approach to climate change planning, states are finding that they can not only
lower their GHG emissions, but they can also secure their energy supply and reliability while
reducing energy costs, protecting their air quality and public health, stimulating economic
development, and reducing traffic congestion.
State actions include:

Development of a baseline GHG inventory;
Development of projections that estimate future emissions based on expected population,
economic growth and other factors;
Development of emission reporting and tracking systems to provide more accurate
emissions data to enhance inventories and projections;
Identification of areas in which emissions could be reduced, and development of GHG
emission reduction goals and targets;
Development of registries and brokering programs for tracking and exchanging emission
offsets;
Development of GHG action plans;
Implementation of GHG reduction measures (e.g., cap-and-trade programs, programs to
promote and require renewable energy and energy efficiency, low emission vehicle
programs, etc.); and
Development of State Climate Adaptation Plan.

The USEPA has developed a website which shows those states that have completed, or are
working on, a state climate action plan, as well as a searchable database of state policy
recommendations by sector contained. These tools can be found at
http://epa.gov/climatechange/wycd/stateandlocalgov/index.html.
In October of 2006, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change released a report entitled
“Climate Change 101: State Action” An update to that report, “Learning From State Action on
Climate Change” was released by the Pew Center in December 2007, highlighting state efforts as

While New Jersey makes up about 3 percent of the U.S. population, it emits less GHG emissions per
capita than the U.S. average, in part because of little heavy industry and a large contribution to its energy
generation from nuclear power.

they responded to the challenges of implementing solutions to climate change. Both of the Pew
Center’s reports can be found at
http://www.pewclimate.org/policy_center/policy_reports_and_analysis/state . The Pew Center
also tracks state actions on climate change at http://www.pewclimate.org/states-regions.
A comprehensive list of state climate actions has been compiled by the National Association of
Clean Air Agencies and is available at http://www.4cleanair.org/.
Finally, the New America Foundation has created the State Climate Policy Tracker, an online
tool to allow state-by-state tracking of hundreds of carbon and energy saving measures now
being implemented across the country. A seven-column matrix captures the climate actions
taking place across six economic sectors, and reports on the progress of each measure, its cost or
cost-saving potential, and the estimated reduction in carbon emissions expected on an annual
basis. This tool can be found at http://www.newamerica.net/programs/climate.

Chapter 1
Introduction and Overview
Introduction
New Jersey’s Global Warming Response Act (GWRA) requires the state to reduce greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 (about a 24% reduction below estimated 2020
business-as-usual (BAU) emissions on a gross emissions, consumption basis). The Act also sets
a long-term goal for New Jersey to further reduce statewide emissions to 80% below 2006 levels
by 2050. 1 The State of New Jersey has adopted several core recommendations needed for the
State to meet its 2020 statewide GHG emission limit. The State also has underway a number of
additional “related actions” which together with the core recommendations will help ensure early
emission reductions to set the state on a path toward achieving its long-term goal. However, the
state recognizes the need to identify and adopt additional measures to provide further assurance
that it will achieve its 2020 goal and to keep the state on course to meet its 2050 goal. Thus, New
Jersey has identified several “supporting recommendations” that, if fully implemented, will
provide assurance that the State will achieve its 2020 limit on its way to meeting its 2050 limit.
This report presents the results of an assessment of the GHG emission reductions and costs or
cost savings associated with supporting recommendations and additional related actions
identified by New Jersey on the basis of data availability. The supporting recommendations were
analyzed incrementally to the core recommendations and related actions adopted by New Jersey
for the following sectors:
• Residential and Commercial Energy Use (i.e., Green Buildings [GB]);
• Waste Management;
• Industrial Sector – Highly Global Warming Gases;
• Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration (TS) by Forestry and Agriculture;
• Transportation and Land Use (TLU); and
• Electricity generation.
For the electricity generation sector, the recommendation to establish a minimum carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions performance standard was analyzed but not included in the overall results
because it is considered a potential implementation mechanism for securing emission reductions
under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The remainder of this chapter provides a
summary of the analytical results for each of the supporting recommendations and related actions
and describes the overall analytical framework for the analysis. Chapters 2 through 7 of this
report provide details on the analytical design parameters, data sources, methods, assumptions,
and results for the recommendations and actions analyzed for each sector; for completeness,
actions with GHG reduction potential but without incremental costs were included in the detailed
economic analyses as though they were being implemented solely to achieve GHG reductions;

1

Taking initiative on a statewide level, Governor Jon S. Corzine signed the Global Warming Response Act
(GWRA) (P.L. 2007, c.112) on July 6, 2007. This new law embodies the proactive and ambitious limits for the
reduction of GHG emissions in New Jersey that were set forth previously in the Governor’s Executive Order 54.

12



however, such actions are not included in the summary monetary figures presented in the current
chapter.
The remainder of this introductory chapter provides a brief overview of the emission reductions
associated with New Jersey’s core recommendations followed by summaries of the results for
the related actions and supporting recommendations analyzed and the overall methodology and
guidelines applied to quantify the GHG emission reductions and costs or cost savings for the
related actions and supporting recommendations.

Core Recommendations – Summary of Emission Reductions
The emission reductions associated with the core recommendations serve as the starting point for
quantification of the related actions and supporting recommendations; therefore, the following
provides a brief overview of the core recommendations. Table 1.1 lists the core
recommendations that New Jersey has adopted for each sector. These core recommendations will
enable New Jersey to meet its near-term statewide GHG reduction goal to reduce GHG
emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Several of these core recommendations also represent the most
cost-effective methods for reducing GHG emissions in the state and will achieve significant
savings through more efficient use of energy by residential, commercial, and industrial buildings
and fuel by on-road vehicles.

Additional Related Actions - Summary of Emissions Reductions
In additional to the core recommendations, New Jersey has underway a number of related actions
that were not expressly designed for GHG reduction purposes but that are expected to produce
such reductions as an added benefit. Table 1.2 summarizes the emissions reductions projected for
these measures. Because the GHG reductions are not the express purpose of these measures, the

13



marginal monetary costs or benefits of these measures are not included in our summary of the
monetary impacts of the supporting recommendations.

Because these actions were implemented for purposes other than GHG reduction, the marginal
cost of such reductions is technically zero. However, they are expected to contribute to New
Jersey’s ability to surpass its 2020 GHG reduction goals on the way to meeting its 2050 goals.

Supporting Recommendations - Summary of Results
A total of 11 supporting recommendations were analyzed; 7 of the recommendations mitigate
GHG emissions, 3 of the recommendations are designed to sequester carbon, and one
recommendation represents a potential implementation mechanism under RGGI. The analytical
results for each supporting recommendation reflect incremental GHG emission reductions and
costs (or savings) relative to New Jersey’s core recommendations and related actions. Each of
the supporting recommendations was evaluated for potential overlap with other supporting
recommendations within the same sector as well as with other sectors and adjusted to remove
potential double-counting of emission reductions and costs (or cost savings). Table 1.3 provides
a summary of the estimated GHG emission reductions and net costs (or savings) associated with
the supporting recommendations analyzed for each sector after adjusting for overlaps. Table 1.4
shows the estimated GHG emission reductions and net costs (or savings) for each of the
supporting recommendations and the adjustments for overlaps made for the TLU and electricity
generation sectors.

The results for the one measure analyzed for the electricity sector are excluded from Table 1.3 because its emission
reductions and costs would otherwise be double counted under RGGI. See Table 1.4 for the estimated impacts
associated with this supporting recommendation.
GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; $/tCO2e = dollars per metric
ton of carbon dioxide equivalent; NPV = net present value.
Costs are discounted to year 2009 in 2007 dollars using a 3% real discount rate. Negative values in the Cost and the
Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings. The values shown in the Cost-Effectiveness column are
calculated by dividing the value in the Cost column by value in the GHG Reduction column; these values represent
the weighted average cost-effectiveness of the Supporting Recommendations within each sector after adjusting for
overlaps between the measures and with recent actions (i.e., for the waste sector).
The order of the sectors presented in this table does not reflect or imply prioritization of the sectors based on the
results presented in this table.

Figure 1.1 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the core and supporting recommendations relative to the BAU reference case
projections for New Jersey.
• The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2004) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
and 2020) levels of New Jersey’s gross GHG emissions on a BAU basis. This consumptionbased approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of electricity in New
Jersey to meet the state’s demand for electricity.
• The red line shows the projected emissions associated with the implementation of the core
recommendations described in Table 1.1.
• The green line shows the projected emissions if all of the recommendations and related
actions are implemented and the estimated reductions are fully achieved.
• Projected emissions associated with New Jersey’s statewide GHG reduction targets are
shown by the black line.
Figure 1.1. Annual GHG Emissions: Reference Case Projections and Core and Supporting
Recommendations (consumption basis, gross emissions)

Table 1.5 provides the numeric estimates underlying Figure 1-1. In summary, if all of the core
recommendations are fully implemented and achieve all of the GHG reductions projected, then
New Jersey will be able to over-achieve its statewide GHG emissions reduction goal of 5%
below 1990 levels by 8.7 MMtCO2e (6.6% below 1990 levels). Should the core measures not
fully achieve their projected emission reduction levels, the related actions and supporting

17



recommendations will provide reductions by 2020 to ensure that New Jersey meets its 2020 goal.
The related actions and supporting recommendations will also place the state well on its way
toward achieving its long-term goal to further reduce statewide emissions to 80% below 2006
levels by 2050. Analysis of the related actions and supporting recommendations indicates that if
fully implemented they have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by an additional 26.5
MMtCO2e in 2020. By 2020, emission reductions associated with both the core and supporting
recommendations and the related actions would place New Jersey at 27% below 1990 levels and
33% below 2006 levels.

It is important to note that, to yield these emission reductions from the core and supporting
recommendations and the related actions, implementation must be timely, aggressive, and
thorough. Evaluation of key factors such as cost-effectiveness, economic impacts, and
harmonization with other New Jersey programs and policies will be critical to effective
implementation of these recommendations and actions.
Overall, the supporting recommendations are projected to result in a net benefit of approximately
$228 million in 2020 (about $14/tCO2e of emissions reduced, on average) after adjusting for
overlaps and interactions between the supporting and core recommendations and related actions.
Over the entire period of analysis (2009-2020), the supporting recommendations are projected to
result in a net cost of about $1.57 billion or, on average, about $18/tCO2e of emissions reduced.
As shown in Tables 1.3 and 1.4, net cost savings are attributed to improving the efficient use of
(1) energy by existing and new residential and commercial buildings, (2) highly warming gases
used in commercial and industrial refrigeration, (3) waste products in the waste sector, and (4)
reduction in vehicle miles traveled in the transportation sector. Cumulative net costs are
attributed to the supporting recommendations for managing forest and agricultural lands as
carbon sinks and other transportation recommendations. For the recommendations designed to
maintain and enhance carbon sequestration, some investment is required to acquire and manage
lands while the emission reduction benefits are not significantly realized for several years past
2020. Thus, the constraint of the analysis period significantly understates the long-term benefits
of these recommendations which are needed to keep New Jersey on its path toward meeting its
long-term GHG reduction goal by 2050.

18



For the transportation sector, the costs associated with increasing the use of low- and zeroemission vehicles and low-carbon fuels in New Jersey are estimated incremental to the
California low-emission vehicle (CA LEV) standards that New Jersey has adopted as a core
recommendation. These standards include both tailpipe emission standards as well as
requirements to improve the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of the on-road vehicle
fleet. The net effect of these two supporting recommendations is that the net cost-effectiveness of
electric vehicle and low-carbon fuels strategies is higher than the CAFE and state clean car
tailpipe standards already adopted by New Jersey and also higher than potential additional
incremental vehicle efficiency improvements.

Overall Methodology and Guidelines for Quantifying
Supporting Recommendations
The following explains the overall methodology and guidelines applied to quantify the GHG
emission reductions and costs / cost savings for the supporting recommendations. This overall
methodology was then customized to incorporate specific design parameters and data sources for
each supporting recommendation analyzed based on information provided by New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) and other New Jersey State agencies. Due to
time and resource constraints, it was not possible to incorporate all costs and benefits associated
with the recommendations analyzed. To the extent possible, direct costs / cost savings were
quantified. The sector-specific chapters included in this report provide details on how the
following overall methodology was customized to quantify GHG emission reductions and costs /
cost savings for each recommendation.
• Cost-Effectiveness: Because the monetized dollar value of GHG reduction benefits for New
Jersey is not available, physical benefits are used instead, measured as dollars per MMtCO2e
(cost per ton) or “cost-effectiveness” evaluation. Both positive costs and cost savings
(negative costs) are estimated as a part of compliance cost.
• Focus of analysis: Net GHG reduction potential in physical units of million metric tons
(MMt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and net cost per metric ton reduced in units of
dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent ($/MtCO2e). Where possible, full life
cycle analysis is used to evaluate the net energy performance of actions (taking into account
all energy inputs and outputs to production). Net analysis of the effects of carbon
sequestration is conducted where applicable.
•

Geographic inclusion: Measure GHG impacts of activities that occur within New Jersey,
regardless of the actual location of emissions reductions.

•

Direct vs. Indirect Effects: Define “direct effects” as those borne by the entities
implementing the recommendation. For example, direct costs are net of any benefits or
savings to the entity. Define “indirect effects” as those borne by the entities other than those
implementing the recommendation. For the quantification of the supporting
recommendations, the following lists indirect cost and/or benefits that were not generally
quantified due to time and resource constraints:
• Re-spending effect on the economy

Net value of employment impacts
Net value of health benefits/impacts (except for TLU-5 and TLU-6)

Energy security
Health benefits of reduced air and water pollution
Ecosystem benefits of reduced air and water pollution
Value of quality-of-life improvements
Value of improved road safety (except for TLU-5 and TLU-6)
Value of net environmental benefits/impacts (value of damage by air pollutants to
structures, crops, etc.)
Net savings on the embodied energy of materials used in buildings, appliances,
equipment, relative to standard practice
Improved productivity as a result of an improved working environment, such as
improved office productivity through improved lighting (though the inclusion of this as
indirect rather than direct might be argued in some cases)

•

Non-GHG (external) impacts and costs: Include in qualitative terms where deemed
important. Quantify on a case-by-case basis as needed depending on need and where data are
readily available.

•

Discounted and “Levelized” Costs: Discount a multi-year stream of net costs (total costs net
of any savings) to arrive at the “net present value cost” of a recommendation. Discount costs
in constant 2007 dollars using a 3% annual real discount rate for the period 2009 through
2020. Capital investments are represented in terms of levelized or amortized costs through
2020. Create a “levelized” cost per ton by dividing the “present value cost” by the cumulative
reduction in tons of GHG emissions. This is a widely used method to estimate the “dollars
per ton” cost or cost savings of reducing GHG emission (all in CO2e). A “levelized” cost is a
“present value average” used in a variety of financial cost applications.

•

Time period of analysis: Count the impacts of actions that occur during the project time
period and, using levelized emissions reduction and cost analysis, report emissions
reductions and costs for 2020. Where additional GHG reductions or costs occur beyond the
project period as a direct result of actions taken during the project period, show these for
comparison and potential inclusion.

•

Aggregation of cumulative impacts of recommendations: In addition to “stand alone” results
for each recommendation, estimate cumulative impacts of all recommendations combined. In
this process avoid simple double counting of GHG reduction potential and cost when adding
emission reductions and costs associated with all of the recommendations. Note and/or
estimate interactive effects between recommendations using simple analytical methods where
overlap is likely.

•

Recommendation design specifications and other key assumptions: Include assumptions on
timing, goal levels, implementing parties, types of implementation mechanism, and other key
assumptions as determined by New Jersey.

20



•

Transparency: Clearly identify recommendation design choices (above) as well as data
sources, methods, key assumptions, and key uncertainties. Use data and comments provided
by New Jersey to ensure best available data sources, methods, and key assumptions using
their expertise and knowledge to address specific issues in New Jersey. Modifications will be
made through decisions with New Jersey technical experts, as needed, to improve analysis.

All projections of future emissions, costs, and cost savings are subject to uncertainty, the key
source of which is the uncertainty associated with the data inputs and assumptions. Due to
constraints on time and resources, we elected to present point estimates of the future values of
emissions, costs and cost savings, and other factors rather than attempt to do a formal uncertainty
analysis. It should also be noted that our results are in the nature of projections rather than
forecasts, the difference being that the former trace out the logical effects of given assumptions
on the future, while the latter make explicit predictions about future states of affairs. New
Jersey's future emissions reductions, costs, and cost savings will probably differ from those
portrayed in this report, and the differences could be significant. Nonetheless, we believe that our
results provide a reasonable basis for decision making, especially when taken as indicators of
direction of change (increase or decrease), algebraic sign (positive or negative), and order of
magnitude.

Chapter 2
Green Buildings for the Residential
and Commercial Sectors
Introduction
Two supporting recommendations for implementing “Green Building” initiatives to mitigate
direct-energy use and GHG emissions by the residential and commercial sectors were analyzed
for their emission reductions and costs / savings. The two recommendations are designed to be
incremental to core recommendations included in New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan (EMP). The
recommendations analyzed include:
• GB-1 - Develop and facilitate the use of a State Green Building Standard for all New
Residential and Commercial Buildings through existing and emerging state programs; and
• GB-2 - Develop and facilitate State Green Building Remodeling, Operations and
Maintenance Program for all Existing Residential and Commercial Buildings through
existing and emerging state programs.
Table 2.1 summarizes the estimated GHG emission reductions and costs (savings) for each
recommendation. The remainder of this chapter provides information on the parameters for
analysis, methods, data sources, and assumptions used to prepare the analysis for each of the
supporting recommendations.

Design of Recommendations
For new buildings (GB-1), the goal is for the State of New Jersey to develop and facilitate the
use of a State Green Building Standard for all New Residential and Commercial Buildings
through existing and emerging state programs. In anticipation of the release of the New Jersey’s
Green Building Manual in the Summer of 2010, which will be used by State agencies to identify
specific actions to incorporate into regulatory and / or incentive-based programs to facilitate new
and existing green buildings, the next 18 months will be used to build capacity in the emerging
green building industry in New Jersey.
For existing buildings (GB-2), the goal is for the State of New Jersey to develop and facilitate
State Green Building Remodeling, Operation, and Maintenance Programs for all Existing
Residential and Commercial Buildings through existing and emerging state programs. In
anticipation of the release of the New Jersey’s Green Building Manual in the Summer of 2010,
which will be used by State agencies to identify specific actions to incorporate into regulatory
and / or incentive-based programs to facilitate new and existing green buildings, the next 18
months will be used to build capacity in the emerging green building industry in New Jersey.

Analytical Approach and Data Sources
A spreadsheet model developed to analyze a similar policy for the state of Maryland was
modified to incorporate New Jersey-specific data sources and assumptions to estimate GHG
emission reductions, costs and cost savings, and the cost-effectiveness of the green building
recommendations for New Jersey. 2 The modifications to the spreadsheet model include the
following:
Emission Reductions:
 The timing and level of future building codes were determined.
 The compliance rate of new and renovated homes and buildings to the new building codes
was assumed.
 Total energy savings from the new building codes were computed based on the number of
participating buildings, average energy use per building, and energy saving rates resulted
from the new building codes.
 The total energy savings were broken out by electricity and natural gas.
 The GHG emission reductions were calculated by using the emission factors of electricity
and natural gas.
Savings:
 This is computed by multiplying energy savings of electricity and natural gas by the avoided
delivered cost of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and then adding them together.

2

The spreadsheet model is based on the model developed to analyze the impacts associated with RCI-1 (Improved
Building and Trade Codes and Beyond-Code Building Design and Construction in the Private Sector) adopted by
the Maryland Climate Change Commission and included in the Maryland Climate Action Plan, see Appendix D-3
for details, August 2008,
http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/Air/ClimateChange/Appendix_D_Mitigation.pdf.

23



Costs:
 Average construction cost of a New Jersey home or commercial building was calculated.
 The incremental costs for new and renovated buildings from future building code
improvements as percentages of the average construction cost were assumed.
 The total incremental costs were computed by multiplying the costs for an individual
building by the total number of participating buildings.
The analyses of the “Green Building” recommendations are designed to be incremental to the
building codes policy in the New Jersey’s EMP. Table 2.1 shows the energy efficiency goals of
the improved building codes in the EMP and the incremental goals included in the analysis of
GB-1/GB-2.

Chapter 3
Waste Management Sector
Introduction
One supporting recommendation and two related actions for the waste sector were analyzed for
their emission reductions and costs / savings. These include:
• W-1 - Improved Efficiency at Publicly Owned Wastewater Treatment Plants (POTWs);
• W-2 - Increase Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Diversion Rate; and
• W-3 - State of the Art Guidelines for Landfill Gas (LFG) Control.
Table 3.1 summarizes the estimated GHG emission reductions and costs (savings) for each of the
three supporting recommendations/related actions. The remainder of this chapter provides

Improved Efficiency at Publicly Owned Wastewater
Treatment Plants (POTWs) (W-1)
Design of Recommendation
The goal of this supporting recommendation is to provide favorable financing from the New
Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Financing Program to local government units (such as
municipal utilities authorities) to install energy efficiency and/or greenhouse gas (GHG)
reduction measures at Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs) and public water supply
systems. Two states for which CCS has provided facilitation and technical support, South
Carolina and Vermont, have set efficiency targets to reduce the amount of electricity at POTWs
by 25%. Therefore, the goal proposed by CCS is a 25% reduction in the amount of electricity
used at POTWs by 2020. A linear ramp-up between 2010 and 2020 is assumed.
POTWs will be encouraged to undertake energy audits to identify processes/equipment that can
be changed or upgraded to reduce energy use and/or greenhouse gas emissions. As part of the
survey discussed below, information will be provided to the POTWs regarding the local
government energy audit program administered by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
The Department intends to increase the practice of using anaerobic digester gases generated at
POTWs for energy generation. As a first step, the Department will be conducting a survey of
approximately 100 POTWs with a design flow of greater than one million gallons per day to
obtain targeted information on digester gas management, the extent to which energy recovery is
utilized, and under what operating conditions. The Department plans to partner with selected
POTWs to develop and refine case studies documenting energy savings, costs and cost savings,
as well as greenhouse gas reductions for different operating scenarios. These studies will be used
to demonstrate how the practice can be effectively applied across a range of POTW sizes and
designs. The Department will use the energy audit data and the case study data to encourage the
use of anaerobic digestion at suitable POTWs.
The Department will develop an education and outreach program to inform POTWs across the
state about the effectiveness and benefits of digester gas energy recovery. The Department will
also take steps to partner with groups representing the wastewater treatment sector, along with
the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities in these activities.
To facilitate implementation of beneficial equipment and process changes identified in the
energy audits and the case study results, the New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure Financing
Program will develop a protocol to provide additional priority points for projects that incorporate
measures to reduce energy usage and/or greenhouse gases at POTWs. In addition, the loan
program will place increased emphasis on compliance with N.J.A.C. 7:22-11(d)5iii(7), which
requires that all wastewater, water and stormwater projects consider opportunities to reduce the
use of energy or recover energy, as part of their facilities plan/project report.
Public water supply systems will be encouraged to conduct energy audits and to replace
inefficient energy-consuming equipment. The New Jersey Environmental Infrastructure

29



Financing Program will develop protocols for providing additional priority points for projects
that incorporate measures to reduce energy usage.

Analytical Approach and Data Sources
This analysis relied on data from EPA’s Clean Watershed Needs Survey (CWNS). 3 The existing
municipal flow for the year 2004 (1,045 MGD) 4 was used as the baseline flow rate for POTWs
in New Jersey. The energy use per million gallons is determined from the median of a survey of
12 Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) (2,286 kWh/MG). 5 The annual BAU WWTP
electricity consumption is estimated by taking the product of the annual municipal flow and the
electricity use (in kWh/MG treated). The goal of 25% electricity use reduction is applied to the
BAU WWTP electricity consumption to yield the amount of electricity avoided in 2020. The
carbon intensity of New Jersey electricity production is multiplied by the electricity avoided to
calculate GHG emission reductions.
The cost-effectiveness estimate is based on the aforementioned analyses completed for similar
GHG mitigation recommendations in South Carolina and Vermont. The basis for the cost
estimates are several case studies of various efficiency improvements at POTWs in Vermont.
These case studies were updated to include 3% interest and discount rates. The energy-saving
technologies considered include variable frequency drives for pumping and aeration motors, high
efficiency aeration motors, improved lighting at buildings, rotary solids dewatering (as opposed
to centrifugal), and implementation of anaerobic digestion for combined heat and power (where
feasible). CCS extracted the per-kWh (avoided) cost of such upgrades at POTWs, as they were
utilized to meet the goals set in South Carolina and Vermont. The average upgrade cost between
the two states is applied to the avoided electricity in New Jersey to calculate the upgrade cost.
The cost savings from avoided electricity is calculated by multiplying the energy avoided by the
projected electricity prices in New Jersey (provided by NJDEP). It is assumed that there is a one
year lag between the incurrence of upgrade cost and the realization of GHG emission reductions.
These key data inputs, including the assumed New Jersey electricity carbon intensity and
electricity prices, are presented in Table 3.2. The electricity carbon intensity is incorporated from
the Electricity Sector Appendix of the New Jersey GHG Inventory and Forecast.
Results
Table 3.3 presents the projected GHG emission reductions due to improved energy efficiency at
POTWs in New Jersey. The cumulative emission reductions (2010-2020) are 2.03 MMtCO2e and
the annual emission reductions in 2020 are 0.39 MMtCO2e. The GHG emission reductions are
estimated by multiplying the kWh avoided through increased energy efficiency at POTWs by the
New Jersey electricity production carbon intensity for each year.

The cost-effectiveness is estimated by applying the factors in Table 3.2 to the GHG emission
reduction estimates in Table 3.3. Table 3.4 presents the levelized (discounted) cost results
assuming a 3% discount rate. The upgrade costs are calculated by adding the levelized upgrade
cost from the previous year (assumed to be zero for 2010) by the product of the average upgrade
cost from the South Carolina and Vermont analyses and the kWh saved in the previous year.
This is done to implement the assumption that there is a one year lag between the incurrence of
upgrade costs and the accrual of GHG emission reductions from that expenditure.

Increase Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) Diversion Rate (W-2)
Design of Action
This related action is designed to achieve the statutorily required 50% MSW diversion goal and
exceed the goal to achieve a 70% MSW recycling rate by 2020, 6 with an ultimate goal of zero
waste production by 2050. According to the most recent county-level recycling statistics
documented on the NJDEP website, the 2006 MSW diversion rate was about 36%, not including
bulky waste (i.e., Class B recyclables, C&D waste). CCS utilized the estimates in the materialspecific recycling statistics document to develop a waste characterization profile for New Jersey.
This step was necessary to generate inputs for the EPA Waste Reduction Model (WARM),
which was used to estimate GHG emission reductions.
The 50% diversion target is statutorily required, but was not included in the business-as-usual
scenario. The quantification of this related action will therefore assess the GHG emission
reduction and cost-effectiveness implications of the 50% BAU target, as compared to the
baseline recycling rate. Additionally, this assessment will estimate the GHG emission reductions
and cost-effectiveness of the 70% target diversion rate, as compared to both the baseline
diversion rate and the 50% BAU target. The goal of zero waste by 2050 is not quantified.
The achievement of the aforementioned diversion targets is dependent on the implementation of
several policy, funding, and outreach mechanisms, many of which have already been identified
and implemented by NJDEP. For example, the New Jersey Solid Waste Management Act (NJSA
13:1E-1 et. seq.), and New Jersey Statewide Mandatory Source Separation and Recycling Act
(NJSA 13:1E-99.11 et. seq.) establish a regulatory system of statewide oversight of county-level
plans to manage solid waste and recycling programs. Substantial funding will also be necessary
for the construction and operation of additional materials recovery facilities (MRF) and
additional recyclable and compostable waste collection efforts. The Recycling Enhancement Act
(REA) provides approximately $20 million annually to counties and municipalities for recycling
assistance. The NJDEP will utilize recycling research or demonstration, education and
professional training money contained in the REA fund to focus on those activities that will
maximize the GHG emissions reductions that can be achieved through recycling, specifically
targeting those materials in the waste stream for which increased recycling will yield the largest
GHG reductions.

6

“Diversion” is equal to the sum of MSW recycled plus MSW composted. New Jersey DEP considers composting
to be a form of recycling. Therefore, recycling and composting will not be considered separately in this analysis.
Source reduction, also a method of waste diversion, is not considered in this analysis.

33



Analytical Approach and Data Sources
The key source of data for the New Jersey baseline waste management scenario was the “New
Jersey Generation, Disposal and Recycling Statistics” webpage. 7 The “Generation, Disposal and
Recycling Rates by County” 2006 data file was used to determine both the baseline diversion
rate and the breakdown of waste diverted and disposed. The total amount of waste generated was
multiplied by 0.50 and 0.70 to determine the tonnage of waste diverted under the two scenarios,
respectively.
The 2006 baseline breakdown of waste generated and diverted, by material (from the “Material
Specific Recycling Rates” data set), 8 was applied to the tonnages under the BAU and policy
scenarios. The resulting material-specific MSW characterization was entered into EPA’s Waste
Reduction Model (WARM) in order to determine the GHG emission reductions above the
baseline (2006) waste management scenario. 9 A linear ramp-up is assumed from zero
incremental diversion in 2010 through full implementation of each scenario in 2020.
The cost-effectiveness estimate is based on the average cost-effectiveness of waste diversion
GHG mitigation recommendations from several other states assisted by CCS. In each of the
selected reference state-level analyses, similar cost and revenue variables were considered in the
quantitative assessment of the recommendations. These analyses have been updated to reflect a
3% discount rate for costs and savings and a 3% real interest rate for capital costs. The cost
variables include capital and operation cost for additional MRF or composting capacity and
additional curbside collection cost. The revenue variables include avoided landfill tipping fees
and revenue from recycled or composted materials. It is known that some costs may be borne in
2010 in order to yield emission reductions beginning in 2011. However, the approach of
applying cost-effectiveness estimates from other states does not allow for costs to be counted for
years in which zero GHG reductions accrue.
Table 3.5 shows the total levelized net cost ($2007 NPV) of GHG mitigation recommendations
in the reference analyses using a 3% discount rate. As the data in this table show, waste diversion
measures in other states assisted by CCS have presented a net cost savings. The average costeffectiveness ($2007/tCO2e) of these states is applied to the GHG emission reduction estimate to
yield the estimated cost-effectiveness of the New Jersey related action.

recycling, combustion, composting, and landfilling. The model calculates emissions in tCe, tCO2e, and energy units
(MMBtu) across a wide range of material types commonly found in MSW. For an explanation of the methodology,

The cumulative emission reductions and cost-effectiveness values in Table 3.5 are based on the
projected life-cycle emission reductions of the recycling GHG mitigation recommendations in
each state. In Michigan, the Climate Action Council chose to report only in-state emissions in the
final summary table (e.g., direct emissions from landfills and waste combustion), which is why
the results in that report differ from those reported in Table 3.5. 10 The nature of recycling as a
mitigation strategy is such that most of the GHG emission reductions are indirect (i.e., emissions
avoided due to reduced extraction of raw materials and energy consumption during
manufacturing of the products and packaging that are not needed due to recycling). These
indirect GHG emission reductions may or may not take place within a given state’s borders, as it
is very difficult to model the entire manufacturing supply chain for all materials recycled in a
given state). Therefore, the only emissions that are known to be reduced in-state through
recycling are the direct emissions from MSW landfills. Based on the WARM outputs, the MSW
landfill emission reductions are much smaller than the indirect emission reductions. The total
cost of recycling is the same regardless of the estimated emission reductions. Therefore, the
absolute value of the cost-effectiveness estimate will be much higher when only in-state
emission reductions are counted.

Results
Table 3.6 presents the projected GHG emission reductions due to an increase above the baseline
waste diversion practices in New Jersey. The cumulative emission reductions (2010-2020) of the
50% (BAU) scenario are 14.4 MMtCO2e and the annual emission reductions in 2020 are 2.61
MMtCO2e. The cumulative emission reductions of the 70% (policy) scenario are 41.8 MMtCO2e
and the annual emission reductions in 2020 are 7.60 MMtCO2e. The difference between the
BAU and policy scenario (identified as GHG Emission Reductions Incremental to BAU)
represents the potential GHG emission reduction due to achieving the 70% goal, as compared to
the statutorily required 50% diversion rate goal.

State of the Art Guidelines for Landfill Gas (LFG) Control
(W-3)
Design of Action
The Department will propose State of the Art (SOTA) guidelines for LFG control pursuant to
N.J.A.C 7:27C 8.12 and 22.35., and is also planning to propose amendments to the design
standards and construction requirements for sanitary landfills gas collection and venting systems.
This analysis addresses the control of methane at landfill sites that currently are not required to
collect and control LFG and are currently venting methane.

Analytical Approach and Data Sources
Data were provided by NJDEP on current LFG control and utilization in the state. 11 These data
included whether the site currently collected and utilized its LFG for energy purposes, collected
and controlled via flaring, vented LFG with passive vents, or was currently not controlled nor
vented. This analysis focused on the sites with passive vents (19 sites). For each site, NJDEP
provided information on the waste in place, year opened, year closed, estimated methane (CH4)
generated, and estimated CH4 emitted.
Of the 19 sites, 10 sites that were closed after 1980 were selected for analysis, since the older
sites could be getting toward the end of their life in terms of methane generation. It was assumed
that 50% of the methane emitted from each site could be collected by the vents and would be
combusted via the use of solar flares attached to each vent. This might appear to be a
conservatively low assumption; however, the US EPA considers the default collection efficiency
for active LFG collection at non-state of the art sites to be 75%. 12 Passive vents are likely to be
less efficient at gas collection than an active gas collection system. Solar flares consist of a
stand-alone unit at each vent of a small open flare that is assisted by spark ignition powered by a
battery and solar panel. In addition to this equipment, it was assumed that a thermocouple and
data logger would be needed for each flare (for monitoring purposes to assure that the flare is
always operational).
For each site, the surface area of the landfill was obtained from NJDEP’s website. 13 For one of
the 10 sites assessed, the area had to be estimated using the average area per cubic yard of waste
in place. Typical LFG design of passive vents suggests a minimum of 1 vent per acre of landfill
surface. Information on the cost of solar flares was taken from the list sheet for Solar Spark Vent
Flares™ sold by Landfill Service Incorporated (www.landfill.com). The cost of each solar flare,
data logger and thermocouple is estimated to be $4,050. Installation and maintenance costs were
not readily available but are estimated at $300 each for installation and $15,600 per landfill site

be 15 years.

Results
Table 3.8 provides an overall summary of the reductions and costs for this recommendation. The
cost-effectiveness was estimate to be less than $2/tCO2e. The recommendation is estimated to
achieve 0.19 MMtCO2e of GHG reductions annually by 2020.

Chapter 4
Control of Highly Warming Gases from Commercial
and Industrial Refrigeration and Air Conditioning
Introduction
This supporting recommendation involves developing a state regulation establishing a Leak
Detection and Repair (LDAR) program for highly warming gases used in commercial and
industrial refrigeration equipment that exceed a threshold size.
Table 4.1 summarizes the estimated GHG emission reductions and costs for this
recommendation. The remainder of this chapter provides information on the parameters for
analysis, methods, data sources, and assumptions used to prepare the analysis for this supporting
recommendation.

Costs are discounted to year 2008 in 2007 dollars using a 3% real discount rate. Negative values in the Cost and the

Design of Recommendation
This recommendation would essentially extend many of the current federal requirements for
Ozone Depleting Substances (ODSs) under Title VI of the federal Clean Air Act to cover
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are used as replacements for ODSs but are currently not
regulated under Title VI. The commercial and industrial refrigeration sector in New Jersey is
projected to release 2.09 MMtCO2e in 2020, which will account for 1.35% of total Statewide
releases of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in that year (based on 2020 BAU without projected
reductions).

Analytical Approach and Data Sources
The analysis for this action is based on a similar analysis undertaken by staff of the California
Air Resources Board (ARB). 15 The ARB analysis drew on data from a survey of 26,000
California businesses with HFC-emitting refrigeration systems; cost data from the survey are
summarized in Table 4.2. 16 ARB staff divided survey respondents into three categories based on
the size of their refrigeration systems; larger facilities tended to have fewer but larger systems
than small or medium facilities.
Most of the costs shown in Table 4.2 vary with the number of systems for which HFC leaks are
to be detected and repaired; a few costs depend solely on the size of the facility. The bulk of the
facilities surveyed were small or medium-sized. Overall, the average facility had an annual cost
(including amortization of capital costs) of just under $1,700 before savings on refrigerant and
net savings of just under $500 net of refrigerant savings.
The total annual cost for the HFC-only facilities came to about $44 million. That cost would be
offset in part by the savings on HFC refrigerant compounds due to earlier leak detection and
repair, estimated by ARB staff at $56.8 million annually, leaving a net savings of $12.8 million.
ARB staff estimated that the 26,000 HFC-emitting facilities emit a total of about 14.3 MMtCO2e
annually, and that about half of that or 7.2 MMtCO2e could be avoided through the proposed
LDAR program. Based on a net savings statewide of $12.8 million, the savings per metric ton
comes to about $1.79. That figure will vary as the price of HFC refrigerants fluctuates on the
world market.
As noted above, it is projected that by 2020 under a BAU scenario, New Jersey’s HFC-emitting
facilities will emit some 2.09 million MtCO2e, or about 15% of California’s statewide emissions.
Assuming that half of New Jersey’s HCF emissions can be avoided through an LDAR program
comparable to that proposed by ARB, about 1.045 million MtCO2e could be avoided. At $1.79
per Mt, the total net savings of a New Jersey LDAR program for HFCs would come to about
$1.87 million.
The annual projected emissions from the New Jersey HFC-emitting facilities between 2009 and
2020 are computed by interpolating between the emission level in 2004 (0.58 million MtCO2e)
and the 2020 projected emission level before reductions of 2.09 million MtCO2e. It is assumed
that half of the annual emissions can be avoided through the program at the savings of $1.79 per
metric ton. All costs were discounted to 2008 using an annual discount rate of 3%.

Chapter 5
Terrestrial Sequestration of Carbon by the Forestry
and Agriculture Sectors
Introduction
Three supporting recommendations and two related actions for sequestering carbon by forest and
agricultural management practices were analyzed for their emission reductions and costs. These
include:
• TS-1 - Expansion of Green Infrastructure/Garden State Preservation Trust (GSPT)
• TS-2 - Forest Stewardship;
• TS-3 - No Net Loss of Forest Reforestation;
• TS-4 - Forest Canopy/Cover Requirement; and
• TS-7 - Sustainable Agriculture.
Table 5.1 summarizes the estimated GHG emission reductions and costs for each of the five
recommendations or actions. The remainder of this chapter provides information on the
parameters for analysis, methods, data sources, and assumptions used to prepare the analysis for
each of the supporting recommendations and related actions.

Design of Recommendations and Actions
The overall purpose of these supporting recommendations and related actions is to enhance
terrestrial carbon sequestration via a set of five supporting recommendations and related actions
for interventions in forest and agricultural land uses, and the state's green infrastructure as a
whole. In forestry, the recommendation is for expansion of the forest stewardship program to
cover 4,000 acres/yr. Forest stewardship plans would be developed to identify, among others, the
best mechanisms for enhancing carbon sinks in forests which currently have less-than-optimal
carbon stocks (e.g., via forest stand improvement or other forest management approaches). The
other forestry options are: 1) a “no net loss” reforestation program that would require all statefunded projects to replace all trees lost in areas impacted by project development; and 2) forest
canopy/cover goals for development areas across the state. In agriculture, a sustainable
agriculture program would expand the use of “no till” practices or other approaches to enhance
levels of soil carbon, thereby indirectly sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Finally, the continued preservation of the state's land assets would be pursued and expanded with
support from the Garden State Preservation Trust (GSPT). The main component of this
recommendation is the Green Acres program, which covers acquisition of conservation lands
comprising the green infrastructure of forests, watersheds and wildlife habitats, freshwater
wetlands, tidal marshes, and agricultural landscapes of environmental significance. A total of
10,000 acres is assumed to be acquired annually and preserved for posterity.

Analytical Approach and Data Sources
Forest Stewardship (TS-2)
The GHG emission reductions for this recommendation were estimated by assessing the carbon
accumulation that would occur over a 45-yr period as forested areas with less than optimal
stocking are improved by one “stocking level” as defined by the U.S. Forest Service. The
targeted acreage is 4,000 acres/yr over 10 years. An estimate of the 45-yr carbon accumulation
achieved by treatment of less than optimally stocked areas was taken from a recent CCS analysis
for New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) (0.80 tCO2/acreyr).
Costs assume that the emission reductions would be achieved by development of stewardship
plans with oversight by New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) or other
state staff and that the treatment would include plantings with disease resistant species
appropriate for each area. The average cost of plantings ($137/acre) was also taken from the
recent work conducted for NYSERDA. The estimated GHG reductions (carbon sequestration)
and cost estimates are provided in Attachment 1.
No Net Loss Program (TS-3)
The recommendation calls for achieving no net loss of forested land (e.g., at the urban fringe and
along transportation corridors). The GHG emission reductions were estimated by using an
45



NJDEP estimate of 5.8 tCO2e/acre-yr of net GHG emission reductions provided by urban forests.
This includes both the GHG emission reductions associated with carbon sequestration as well as
the energy savings provided by urban trees via shading and wind protection. The
recommendation calls for trees to be either retained or an equivalent number replanted in a
nearby location. Under the recommendation, an estimated 67 acres/yr would be covered. NJDEP
estimated that there is an average of 204 trees/acre. The number of trees retained or planted was
used along with the net GHG emission reduction estimate above to estimate GHG reductions in
each year.
The length of the No Net Loss program was assumed to be through 2020; however, the emission
reductions continue to accrue over the life of the urban trees covered by the program (assumed at
30 years on average). To estimate the costs of the program, CCS assumed that all of the trees
would need to be replanted. Of the trees that would need to be replanted, CCS assumed that onethird would be strategically located to provide energy savings to buildings. NJDEP provided an
estimate of tree replacement cost of $300 per tree. To estimate the value of energy savings, an
average per-tree estimate of emissions reduction from energy savings was taken from the CCS
analysis for NYSERDA (0.0034 tCO2/yr). Most of this would be associated with shading effects
which would reduce electricity consumption. Using the per-tree emission reduction estimate and
the carbon content of NJ electricity (0.569 tCO2e/MWh), an estimated energy savings of 5.98
kWh/tree-yr was derived. NJDEP provided estimates of average electricity prices (ranging from
$0.112/kWh in 2005 to $0.186/kWh in 2020). Total costs in each year were the sum of the
annualized tree planting and administrative costs, offset in part by the energy savings. The
estimated GHG reductions and costs are provided in Attachment 2.
Forest Canopy/Cover Requirement (TS-4)
Here the program goals are to retain urban tree canopy coverage and rural forest cover in all
developable areas of the state including those that are not environmentally sensitive. The targeted
area for enhancing canopy cover is much larger at 30,000 acres/yr (estimate provided by NJDEP)
with a goal of retaining 50% of all forest canopy/cover. As the program will cover both rural and
urban areas, the same net emission reduction estimate for carbon sequestration was used here
(5.8 tCO2e/acre-yr) for the both the rural forest cover and urban forest canopy components. Key
assumptions used in the analysis are that under BAU all of the trees on developed acres would be
removed (NJDEP estimates an average statewide forest cover of 40% covering both rural and
urban areas). GHG reductions in both the rural and urban areas were estimated using a value of
5.8 tCO2/acre-yr provided by NJDEP as a statewide average estimate of carbon sequestration. In
the urban areas, it was assumed that the replacement trees would be strategically planted to
reduce energy use, resulting in energy savings (from shading and wind protection for buildings).
The avoided CO2 due to these energy savings was taken from the CCS analysis for NY
(0.0034 tCO2/tree-yr).
Costs were estimated separately for rural and urban development. The break-out of lands to be
developed through 2020 was assumed to be 60% urban and 40% rural. For rural costs, an
estimated reforestation cost of $550/acre was used, which is the average cost estimated in the
CCS analysis for NY state. For urban costs, a similar approach to that described above for the No
Net Loss Program was used, except that it was assumed that all replanted trees in urban areas

46



would be strategically placed to achieve energy savings. Based on data from 4 NJ cities, the
average number of mature urban trees per acre is 45. 17 The same replanting costs as the No Net
Loss Program ($300/tree) were applied. Costs for the incremental urban tree maintenance were
also included, since there would be an increase in the number of trees above baseline ($8.50/tree
taken from the CCS analysis for NYSERDA). The annual GHG reductions and costs are shown
in Attachment 3.
Sustainable Agriculture (TS-7)
This analysis focused on achieving soil carbon gains (indirectly sequestering carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere) through no till farming (the recommendation also addresses other
sustainable agricultural practices that can achieve GHG emission reductions). The incremental
annual cultivated area brought into continuous no-till farming targeted by NJDEP is assumed to
be 3,500 acres, and the program is assumed to last for 10 years. From a similar analysis
conducted by CCS for NYSERDA, it is estimated that continuous no-till practices can sequester
0.454 tCO2/acre annually. Also, from the same analysis, there are additional GHG reductions via
lower diesel fuel consumption of 0.043 tCO2/acre-yr.
Under the program, farmers would receive an incentive of $10/acre-yr. Fuel cost savings of 3.5
gallons/acre are estimated at a current cost of $2.46/gallon (fuel costs are estimated to increase
by 2.4%/yr based on data from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information
Administration). Total annual costs are the cost of no-till practices net of payments to farmers,
fuel savings, and administrative costs. The annual GHG reductions and costs are shown in
Attachment 4.
Green Infrastructure (TS-1)
This program is primarily concerned with acquisition and conservation management of priority
protected landscapes and open spaces throughout the state. Sequestering these lands maintains
and enhances their ecosystem functions and services, which include carbon uptake and
accumulation in vegetation and soils. The GHG emission reductions (associated with carbon
sequestration of lands to be conserved) were estimated following a two-step process. First, the
typology of lands acquired under the Green Acres program was determined and the percentage
share of each type was applied to the to the total target area of lands assumed to be purchased
annually (10,000 acres). The percentage composition as determined from Green Acres and GSPT
program reports is as follows: 55% forestlands, 30% wetlands including tidal wetlands, 5%
farmlands, and 7% others (open space, urban, barren lands). Open waters comprise 3%, but these
are assumed to have no significant sequestration. Second, carbon removal coefficients
appropriate for each land type were used to estimate the carbon sequestration to be expected
from land preservation. 18 The amount of sequestration is cumulative as acreage is added every

year through 2020. The lands continue sequestering carbon through time, at least until individual
trees die (for simplicity this has been ignored since the projection only goes out to 2020).
The cost of land acquisition is assumed to average $15,000 per acre based on Green Acres data.
It should be noted that the program is contingent on the re-authorization of Garden State
Preservation Trust funding. Legislation is currently pending gubernatorial approval for a voter
referendum on the bond issue this year, and approval of the legislation by the Governor and
voters is assumed for analytic purposes. The bill proposes funding for Green Acres at the level of
$218 million. At the specified cost of acquisition, the proposed funding would be exhausted in
less than two years' time. Historically, however such referenda have been held every 3 to 4 years,
and the 2007 bond issue will be exhausted in 2010. The current legislation does not indicate
which years the bond issue covers, so the estimates assume constant annual funding will be
available for 2010 to 2020 at the level of $150 million annually, i.e., 10,000 acres times $15,000
per acre.
Based on the foregoing assumptions, the NJDEP estimates that a total of about 4.5 million metric
tons of CO2 equivalents would be sequestered from 2010 through 2020 (see Tables 5.2 and 5.3).
The annual cost of $150 million is discounted to 2009 using an annual discount rate of 3%; this
treatment is in keeping with that used for the other recommendations considered in this report,
and it results in a present value cost (in real 2007 dollars) of about $1.3 billion. The direct cost of
this related action is therefore $308 per MtCO2e. The relatively high direct cost is attributable to
the cost of the land being preserved. This estimated cost does not reflect the value of the
ecosystem services preserved through the program.
The true economic cost of preserved land is less than the annual cost used here when the avoided
cost of community infrastructure and other services (sewer, waste, water, schools, etc.) is taken
into account. Certain studies indicate that preserved land requires, on a per dollar basis, from 35
to 37 cents of these services as against $1 to $1.19 for residential development 19 (Compton,
2007; American Farm Trust). This translates to a 1:3 ratio. When the avoided cost of community
infrastructure services is accounted for, the actual cost of preserved land is reduced accordingly.
Based on the 1:3 ratio, the actual cost is $5,000 annually. Taking this approach reduces the direct
cost of this related action to $103 per MtCO2e (see Table 5.3). As in the original analysis, this
cost does not reflect the value of the ecosystem services preserved through the program.

It is estimated that open space requires only 35 cents in services and that open space reduces the cost of services
and Taxes (Crompton, J.L., 2004. The proximate principle: the impact of parks, open space and water features on
residential property values and the property tax base). Other studies show that residential development required an
average of $1.19 in municipal services vs. farmland that required only 37 cents in services (American Farmland
Trust http://www.farmlandinfo.org/documents/27757/COCS_09-2007.pdf ).

Sensitivity Analysis
The results shown for Forest Stewardship, the No Net Loss Program, and the Forest
Canopy/Cover Requirement are based on total emissions and total net present value costs
through 2020. That year was chosen to make the results of these analyses comparable to those
for the other supporting recommendations and related actions considered in this report. However,
barring such events as disease, fire, land clearing, etc., trees are inherently long-lived assets, and
therefore choosing such a relatively short time horizon understates both the emissions reductions
and the costs. Because most of the implementation costs for these three programs are incurred in
the early years, the net result is to overstate the cost per MtCO2e for shorter versus longer time
horizons. The effect of time horizon on the cost-effectiveness of the supporting
recommendations and related actions is presented in Table 5.5. As Table 5.5 shows, the cost per
MtCO2e is cut roughly in half when the longer time horizon is used. While the results from the
2020 analysis are presented in Chapter 1, it is important to keep in mind the very different results
that use of a longer time horizon would produce.

Chapter 6
Transportation and Land Use
Introduction
Six supporting recommendations or related actions for mitigating carbon by transportation and
land use measures were analyzed for their emission reductions and/or costs. These include:
• TLU-1 - Facilitate Widespread use of Low-Emission and Zero-Emission Vehicles
• TLU-2 - Require Low-Carbon Fuels;
• TLU-3 - Transition to Low-Carbon Methods of Goods Movement;
• TLU-4 - Maintain Good State-of-Repair in Roads Infrastructure and Operation while
mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) Impacts;
• TLU-5 - Reduce vehicle-miles traveled (VMT); and
• TLU-6 - Double Transit Ridership and Enhance Greenhouse Commuting Programs.
Table 6.1 summarizes the estimated GHG emission reductions and costs for each of the six
recommendations or actions. The remainder of this chapter provides information on the
parameters for analysis, methods, data sources, and assumptions used to prepare the analysis for
each of the supporting recommendations or related actions.

Overview of Analytical Approach
Analysis of transportation and land use issues is inherently complex, given the inter-relationships
among transportation systems, land use, and other important aspects of societal well-being.
Several issues arise in any assessment of the GHG emissions impacts associated with changes to
the transportation system. The variables and assumptions used have a significant impact on the
outcome. Key variables include but are not limited to (1) future growth rates for VMT,
(2) average fuel prices, and (3) discount rates. Evaluation of the baseline scenario is also as
important as is an evaluation of the validity of changes to the baseline.
For any specific analysis of changes to the transportation system, a number of analytical
questions arise. Some of these questions include:
(1) What is the affected population?
(2) What portion of the population is affected?
(3) What is the market penetration rate for any changes to business as usual?
(4) How quickly is the population affected (i.e., is the pattern linear, exponential, or
asymptotic)?

56



The analytic methods and the results they produce are often dependent upon professional
judgments by stakeholders and the timing and sequencing of programs and projects:
(1) When do the programs start?
(2) How long is the ramp-up period?
(3) What is the shape of ramp-up period to the horizon year?
(4) What horizon year is used?
(5) Is peer group comparison data used? (e.g., data related to the size of urbanized areas,
patterns of baseline development, and stages in pathway upon technology curves).

Costs are discounted to year 2009 in 2007 dollars using a 3% real discount rate. Negative values in the Cost and the
Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings.
The numbering used to denote the above supporting recommendations and related actions is for reference purposes
only; it does not reflect prioritization among these recommendations.

57



To ensure consistent results across recommendations, common factors and assumptions are used
for the following items:
• Independent and integrated analyses—Each recommendation is first analyzed individually
and then addressed as part of an overall integrated analysis.
•

Fuel costs and projected escalation—Fuel cost estimates are based on common sources
wherever possible. For example, fossil fuel price escalation is indexed to the U.S.
Department of Energy (U.S. DOE), Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections as
indicated in their most recent Annual Energy Outlook 2008 (AEO2008). 20

•

Consumption-based approach—The analysis uses a consumption-based approach where
emissions are calculated on the basis of the consumption of transportation fuels (regardless of
where produced) to provide energy to consumers, as opposed to a production-based
approach, which considers the emissions from in-state production of transportation fuels
(regardless of where the fuels are consumed).

•

Life-cycle GHG approach—Life-cycle GHG emissions are considered to the extent feasible.
The use of the U.S. DOE life-cycle emissions analysis tools (i.e., GREET and VISION)
facilitates these analyses of the life-cycle GHG emissions of Transportation and Land Use
sector activities.

In addition to estimating the impacts of each individual policy recommendation, the combined
impacts of the TLU policy recommendations are estimated, assuming that all policies are
implemented together. This “overlap analysis” involves adjusting gross totals for the TLU sector
to avoid double-counting of impacts. In addition, overlaps between policy recommendations in
the TLU sector and policies in other sectors were identified. The following section identifies
where these overlaps occur and summarizes the methods used to adjust the impacts analysis to
avoid double-counting of impacts. Potential synergies between TLU policies may not be fully
accounted for, and so the results are best interpreted as conservative estimates of GHG
reductions.

Method for Analyzing the Potentially Overlapping Impacts of Combined TLU
Policies
It is widely accepted that there are three general categories of factors that impact the emission of
GHGs from the transportation sector. These three general categories are often described as “the
three-legged stool.” The three categories (or three legs of the stool) are vehicle characteristics,
fuels, and travel activity or travel demand.
These three factors interact in a complex fashion to affect on GHG emission levels. The
following formula summarizes this interaction in a simplified fashion:
(1) Vehicle miles traveled per year divided by
(2) Miles per gallon multiplied by
(3) Million metric tons of carbon equivalent (MMtCO2e) per gallon yields
(4) MMtCO2e per year.

Thus, the GHG emissions reductions resulting from individual stand-alone policies are not
simply additive. For example, a policy that reduces VMT will reduce the GHG benefits of a
policy that improves fuel economy or one that reduces fuel carbon intensity and vice versa.
The cumulative GHG emissions reduction that would result if all TLU policies described below
were implemented as a package was estimated by identifying the potential for overlap between
the policies as follows:
• TLU Categories 1 and 2 and the New Jersey LEV program affect both the light-duty vehicle
(LDV) and heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) fleets, while TLU-3 affects the HDV fleet. Overlaps
between TLU-3 and the other measures were not assessed because TLU-3 relates to the
operation and use of HDVs and does not relate to the vehicle technologies themselves.
• TLU Category 1 and the New Jersey LEV program affect vehicle fuel economy. TLU-2 and
TLU-3 affect the carbon intensity of fuels. TLU-4 affects traffic flow and operations in urban
areas, which primarily impact vehicle fuel economy. TLU Categories 5 and 6 affect primarily
LDV VMT. The overlap within each of these three groups was first determined.
• As a final step, the overlap between each of the three categories of the three-legged stool was
estimated and applied. The use of the VISION model was a critical tool in this step in the
overlap analysis. Consecutive and alternative VISION model runs provided an estimate of
the overlap between Categories 1, 2, and NJ LEV. In addition, alternative VMT inputs into
VISION with subsequent runs of the model provided an estimate of the overlap between the
VMT categories and other categories.

Facilitating Widespread Use of Low and Zero Emissions
Vehicles (TLU-1)
To quantify the GHG emission reductions and cost-effectiveness of low and zero emissions
vehicles, a target of 10% reduction in carbon intensity over predicted levels in 2020 was
assumed. This target is based on New Jersey’s stated commitment to developing an approach to
implementing a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) that would reduce carbon intensity by 10% by
2020. There are many approaches and combinations of approaches to achieving this goal, and
analysis of all of the approaches is beyond the scope of this study. Therefore a single welldefined scenario was selected for investigation.
In this analysis, new electric vehicles powered by zero-emission energy sources are assumed to
displace new gasoline internal combustion engine LDVs so that the target is met. The analysis
was performed with the VISION spreadsheet modeling tool. 21 VISION provides estimates of the
potential energy use, oil use and carbon emission impacts through 2100 of advanced LDV and
HDV vehicle technologies and alternative fuels. The VISION model reflects data from EIA's
AEO2008 report and includes vehicle fleet characteristics for the entire United States. To
generate emission estimates, the VISION model uses full fuel-cycle carbon emissions rates from
Argonne National Laboratory's GREET model.
The VISION model default values used in the present study reflect the characteristics of the U.S.
vehicle fleet and fuel prices. These characteristics were not altered, with the exception of the
proportions of electricity derived from various sources, which were based on the New Jersey
energy profile for February 2009. 22 On-road fuel consumption in New Jersey was derived from
VMT estimates and the U.S. fleet fuel efficiency characteristics. Forecasted State fuel
consumption as a percentage of the U.S. was used as a scaling factor to scale the VISION U.S.
results to New Jersey. Vehicle costs were scaled using the share of vehicle registrations in New
Jersey to the U.S. total. 23
Other Assumptions
• 100% of the electricity necessary to power new electric vehicles was assumed to be derived
from wind, solar and geothermal. Many other blends of energy sources are possible, but this
one was selected for analysis because it is assumed that additional electrical power for
electric vehicles would be fully powered by renewable energy sources.
• The new electric LDV market share of new car sales was assumed to increase linearly from
2010 to 2020 when it reaches 22.55% and attains a 10% reduction in carbon equivalent
emissions against forecasted emissions.
• New electric vehicles were assumed to displace gasoline internal combustion engine market
share.

Requiring Low-Carbon Fuels in the Transportation Sector
(TLU-2)
To quantify the GHG emission reductions and cost-effectiveness of a LCFS, a target of 10%
reduction in carbon intensity over predicted levels in 2020 was assumed. This target is based on
New Jersey’s stated commitment to developing an approach to implementing a low-carbon fuel
standard that would reduce carbon intensity by 10% by 2020. The standard is assumed to be met
by fuel providers: refiners, importers, and blenders of on-road vehicle fuels. The LCFS is
assumed not to specify a particular mix of fuel types—the fuel formulations are left to fuel
providers, who decide how to meet the standard. The possible fuels that could be used to meet
the standard are assumed to include ethanol, biodiesel, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG), hydrogen, and electricity.
As with TLU-1, many approaches could lead to achievement of the 10% goal, and a single one
was selected for investigation. The analysis here was performed by examining the impact of
increased sales of spark ignition plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (SI PHEV). (Note: according to
AEO 2008 forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions, biofuels were not sufficiently low in emissions
to achieve the 10% goal.) Previous analyses have been conducted using the methods described
below for several other states, including Washington, Montana, South Carolina, Iowa, and
Arkansas.
The analysis was performed with the VISION spreadsheet modeling tool (see TLU-1 for a
description). The VISION model default values used here reflect the characteristics of the U.S.
vehicle fleet and fuel prices. These characteristics were not altered, with the exception of the
proportions of electricity derived from various sources, which were based on the New Jersey
energy profile for February 2009. 25 On-road fuel consumption in New Jersey was derived from
VMT estimates and the U.S. fleet fuel efficiency characteristics. The forecasted State fuel
consumption as a percentage of the U.S. fuel consumption was used as a scaling factor to scale
the VISION U.S. results to New Jersey. Vehicle costs were scaled to New Jersey using the ratio
of vehicle registrations in New Jersey to the U.S. total. 26
Other Assumptions
• According to default carbon coefficients in the VISION model, New Jersey electricity
produces 24.64 MMtCO2e per quadrillion British thermal unit (Btu), and gasoline produces
26.87. The majority of the decrease in emissions in the present study is thus from the
increased mileage per gallon of the vehicles rather than from fuel switching.
•

25
26

To reach the goal of a 10% decrease in carbon intensity by 2020, sales of new gasoline
internal combustion engine vehicles were assumed to be phased out entirely by 2018 in favor
of SI PHEVs. (In the individual analyses for TLU-1 and TLU-2, CCS assumed that the new
vehicle technologies (ZEV and SI PHEV) replaced the most fuel inefficient technology,
which was gasoline, and the model was able to increase new sales penetration to meet the
10% reduction goals by subtracting the corresponding new sales market penetration from the
gasoline-only vehicle sales percentage forecast. However, when the two technologies were

combined for the overlap analysis, the combined new sales percentage of ZEVs and SI
PHEVs went beyond the forecasted new sales percentage of gasoline-only vehicles in 2017.)
•

Annual percentage reductions in carbon-equivalent emissions were applied to a baseline
forecast of GHG emissions for New Jersey to determine the forecasted reduction in CO2e
emissions.

Savings
• Avoided gasoline and ethanol sales were based on forecasted U.S. fuel prices and multiplied
by a scaling factor for New Jersey.
Costs
• Vehicle costs were calculated by multiplying the cost of SI PHEV over the cost of a
conventional gasoline vehicle by the number of vehicles sold, scaled to New Jersey.
•

Increased electricity consumption was multiplied by the forecasted U.S. price of electricity
and scaled to New Jersey.

Transition to Low-Carbon Methods of Goods Movement
(TLU-3)
To quantify the GHG emission reductions and net costs of a transition to low-carbon methods of
goods movement, the following three approaches were examined:
• Encouraging truck stop electrification;
• Promoting the use of plug-in trailer refrigeration units; and
• Encouraging increased use of shuttle rail to move goods.
The effects of encouraging truck stop electrification (TSE) were calculated by estimating the
number of expected TSE units during the policy analysis period (i.e., 2009 to 2020), the GHG
reductions attributed to a TSE unit relative to traditional engine idling, and the cost of expanding
TSE units on a per unit basis. The 2009 count of TSE units in New Jersey was estimated using
information from the U.S. DOE. 27 The number of truck stops in New Jersey is assumed to
increase at the same growth rate as TSE units in New York, as estimated in a recently completed
NYSERDA study. GHG emissions relative to traditional idling practices and TSE unit costs were
obtained from a 2004 TRB study. 28
There is a lack of readily available data on the number of trailer refrigeration units (TRUs) in
New Jersey. Accordingly, the number of TRUs in New Jersey was estimated by scaling the
number of TRUs in New York, according to a recently completed NYSERDA study, by the
population ratio for the two states. Plug-in TRU GHG emissions relative to traditional idling
practices and TRU unit costs were obtained from a 2004 TRB study. 29 The analysis utilizes a
perpetual inventory of TRUs that enter and exit the TRU population as old units are phased out
and new units are purchased over time.
The effects of encouraging increased use of freight rail diversion were estimated from a national
level estimate of the impacts of freight rail diversion. New Jersey’s share of the estimated GHG
reduction and cost estimates were scaled using New Jersey’s current share of national rail freight
movement, which is estimated to be 1.3% of all national rail-transported freight and available rail
lines. 30
Other Assumptions
• The annual percentage reductions in carbon-equivalent emissions were applied to a baseline
forecast of GHG emissions for New Jersey to determine the reductions in CO2e emissions.
Savings
• Avoided gasoline and ethanol sales were obtained by multiplying a scaling factor for New
Jersey by forecasted U.S. fuel prices.

Costs
• TRU and TSE program costs are calculated by multiplying the cost of a TRU or TSE unit by
the number of TRUs and TSEs expected to be sold in New Jersey over time minus the fuel
savings expected from introducing the new technology. The number of TSEs sold is based on
a growth rate assigned to the number of TSEs currently in New Jersey. The number of TRUs
is scaled down from the number of TRUs in New York based on the population ratio for the
two states.
•

Rail freight diversion costs were estimated by scaling down the national-level costs of rail
freight diversion based on the current share of rail freight that is transported through New
Jersey according to the Association of American Railroads. 31 To calculate the costs and
levels of rail diversion that might be realized, a credible source is AASHTO’s Bottom Line
report for rail. 32

Maintaining a Good State of Repair in Roads Infrastructure
and Operation while Mitigating Greenhouse Gas Impacts
(TLU-4)
Transportation System Management (TSM), the key concept here, means managing and
operating the transportation system to help transportation networks meet demand in an effective
and efficient manner. Effective system management may utilize a variety of strategies based on
advanced technologies, market-based incentives, regulations, and design standards. Each strategy
provides a relatively small benefit in terms of GHG reduction, but when applied in concert,
significant gains can be achieved.
Technological improvements include traffic signal coordination, lane management, traveler
information displays, and other “intelligent” transportation system applications. Incentives can
include policies that financially favor desired behavior or that allow users to gain a time
advantage and include value pricing and smart parking strategies. System design is also
important since infrastructure and technology can be adapted to encourage less driving; system
design includes access management applications and intersection improvements. Finally, users
can be barred from performing certain actions that would negatively impact the efficiency of the
transportation system. TSM policies can be instituted at every level of government; some can
have a virtually instant effect, while others require many decades to reap the full benefits.
For this related action, the emission reductions and costs associated with expansion of
emergency service patrols and of signal synchronization were estimated using data that was
provided by various New Jersey state and local agencies. Analysis of the cumulative impacts was
conducted using simple spreadsheet analysis techniques; given the relatively small size of the
projects involved, no ramp-up was assumed within the eleven-year period from 2009 to 2020.
Cost estimates were based on information provided by New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection (NJDEP). Table 6.5 provides a summary of the emission reductions and net cost
savings estimated for this related action.

Reducing Vehicle Miles of Travel (TLU-5)
The most common approach for reducing travel activity is to reduce VMT; therefore, for this
supporting recommendation, methods for reducing VMT were analyzed. The baseline forecast of
VMT in the absence of new technologies and institution of certain “best practices” is based on
VMT data provided by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). Based on
historical trends, VMT are increasing at an annual rate of 1.7% over the 2005 baseline value of
64.2 billion VMT and at that rate would reach 82.6 billion VMT in 2020. If instead VMT
increases were held to 1%/year, the level would reach 74.5 billion VMT in 2020, or about 8.1
billion VMT/year less. GHG emissions associated with vehicle travel would decline accordingly.
This comparison raises the following questions:
1. Is a reduction of 8.1 billion VMT/year by 2020 realistic?
2. What policy measures would be needed to achieve that reduction?
3. What would be the net costs or benefits of those measures?
A variety of state, regional, and municipal land use planning and development practices and
expansion of travel mode options can affect the number and length of vehicle trips. There is no
one program or approach that can achieve New Jersey’s VMT and GHG reduction goals, but
over the long term, a suite of approaches can substantially reduce the state’s GHG emissions by
reducing the growth in VMT. It should be noted that within any group of approaches, the strength
of implementation is a key variable.
•

Estimating the impact of all of the many potential VMT-reducing mechanisms is beyond
the scope of this study. The analysis presented in this section and the next simplifies by
dividing the potential mechanisms into those producing primary or direct VMT
reductions due to (e.g., expanding public transit) and those resulting in secondary or
indirect reductions (e.g., stemming from a shift towards more compact development
patterns). 33 The terminology is widely used in the field and does not imply relative
importance.

•

The analysis of the potential for VMT reduction relies upon a well-established body of
research and policy analysis that incorporates the concept of ‘transit leverage’. Statistical
studies of cities around the world have shown that those with significant transit
investments show a more energy-efficient use of the transportation system that is not
fully accounted for simply by 'mode shift' from private automobiles to bus and rail transit.
There has been increasing understanding that transit networks also allow for more trip
chaining (see below), shorter driving trips, and more walking trips. As a result,
researchers have recognized in the last decade that some cities have been able to
“leverage” transit investments in a manner that augments their impact.

Newman describes the operation of transit leverage as follows: “The phenomenon of ‘transit
leverage’ is where people who switch from a car to transit actually save more than just one
33

More compact development can reduce truck trip lengths, but the vast majority of the literature examines lightduty vehicle (LDV) VMT only. This study therefore considers potential GHG reductions from reductions in VMT
for personal (non-commercial) travel.

67



passenger km [kilometer] for one passenger km as an engineer would calculate. For a start trains
go straighter than cars and hence even for the same destination there will be extra passenger km
saved. Then passengers tend to do ’trip chaining’ where several functions are combined like
shopping, collecting dry cleaning, picking up children, when they take a transit trip which means
even more passenger km are saved. Then as is often the case with quality transit, households
save on (i.e., eliminate) one car and hence even more trips are saved. Finally, transit tends to
attract land use around it and hence even fewer passenger km are generated.”34
The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) and the United States Federal Transit
Administration (FTA) have both recognized the role and contribution of transit leverage and
have provided information to assist transit agencies and policy analysts to consider the effects of
transit leverage. As Johnston states, “[t]he most effective policy sets combine land use policies,
such as compact growth, with strong transit provision and not expanding highway capacity. The
addition of auto pricing policies, such as fuel taxes, work trip parking charges, or all-day tolls
increases the effectiveness of land use and transit policies.” In reviewing one study of U.S.
scenario exercises, Johnston found that “[t]hese studies generally evaluated modest growth
management policies and did not employ the pricing of parking or fuels or roadways. So, these
results may be viewed as lower bounds on what VMT reductions could occur in scenario
exercises.” 35
The concept of “transit leverage” (or the “land use multiplier” as it is sometimes called) is
backed by significant scientific evidence based on international comparisons of cities. For
example, a Canadian study suggested that “capital investment in expanded transit systems
appears to have relatively little impact on GHG reductions on its own unless accompanied by
highly integrated and effective travel demand management (TDM) measures. Effective TDM
may also require the gradual introduction of road pricing. In other words, achieving transit
ridership goals and associated emissions reductions requires appropriate TDM policies (probably
eventually including road pricing) and real land use initiatives. At the same time, if appropriate
TDM policies are implemented, considerable capital investment in expanded transit services will
be required to accommodate the anticipated modal shifts.” 36
Strength of the “Transit Leverage” Effect
A large body of literature now documents the effects of compact, transit-oriented land-use
patterns on reducing vehicle trips and vehicle travel (for a recent synthesis, see Ewing,
Bartholomew et al. 2008). Appendix A describes some of the more noteworthy studies.
Evidence for the transit leverage or land-use multiplier is considerably strengthened by the
fact that the studies generate results that are at least the same order of magnitude. This is

despite significant differences in methodologies, geographic context and the method of
computing the multiplier (some studies report it as the reduction in vehicle travel per transit
passenger mile, while others report it as a multiple of the primary mode shift effect). 37
The research shows an overall consensus on the general range of the transit leverage effect,
namely somewhere between 2 and 7 times for North American urban areas. This means that
for every mile reduction in VMT due to increased transit options and mode shift, between 2
and 7 additional miles are reduced due to indirect or secondary effects. It is plausible that the
international comparisons show a higher range of values because cities and countries in other
parts of the world have been able to successfully 'leverage' transit to a higher degree than
most American cities have to date. Some results are based on U.S. transit, including busbased systems, while other studies use data are from global cities with higher densities and a
higher proportion of rail systems; given this, it is not surprising that the multiplier effects
reported in the latter are sometimes stronger.
The transit leverage research and other related regional modeling research provide the basis
for the following general method of quantifying and allocating the indirect effects of transit
on VMT:
(1) An urban growth boundary can provide an impact roughly equal to the direct transit effect
(i.e., it has a leverage of 1.0 “units” or 1.0 times the direct effect).
(2) A low level of travel demand management (TDM) programs can produce an effect roughly
half as large as direct transit investment or 0.5x the direct effect.
(3) A high level of TDM programs can produce an additional 1.0 unit effect, for a total
potential of 1.5x the direct effect from TDM programs.
(4) A program of significant auto use pricing (some combination of fuel taxes, tolls and other
facility charges, parking charges, etc) can have an effect equal to the overall TDM effect.
(5) Congestion reduction associated with transit has an estimated effect that is 0.2x the direct
transit effect.
(6) The remaining indirect effects may be considered to be mainly related to land use, including
overall residential and job density, as well as transit-oriented development and other aspects
of 'smart growth'.
Strategies that seek to result in avoided travel and trips are usually referred to “travel demand
management” or TDM. Some TDM strategies being considered by New Jersey for
implementation do not yet have sufficient data to provide an estimate of GHG emission and
energy savings. For example, a regional network of High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes involves
converting existing High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes to HOT and using the revenue
generated to finance completion of the HOV/HOT system as well as other improvements within
the HOT corridors. HOT lanes could provide for reduced congestion and emissions and provide
faster and more predictable travel times for carpools and buses. Funds from HOT lanes could
allow the region to complete its HOV network without having to rely on outside funds. Such a
program could have a significant impact on VMT, but its extent and cost have not been
developed in sufficient detail to include in the present analysis.

Application to New Jersey
In applying the transit leverage analysis to the state of New Jersey, several factors were
considered:
(1) Are there urban limit lines (growth boundaries) that are in place or being considered?
(2) Does New Jersey as a state have a 'low TDM' or a 'high TDM' program level?
(3) Is a system of auto use pricing (including HOT lanes and New Jersey Transit parking
charges) being considered for the horizon year of 2020?
Based on information provided by various state and local agencies about programs and policies
in place and being considered, the indirect effects were assessed qualitatively as follows:
1. Urban growth boundaries were judged not to be in effect, but a program of growth
management exists in terms of infrastructure investment and channeling of development
toward locations where infrastructure is already available.
2. The level of TDM was judged to be high in suburban areas and medium in urban areas; the
latter is lower because there tend to be more transit options in urban areas and where such
options are available, people tend to use them without special TDM measures. The state as a
whole can be characterized as medium to high in terms of TDM level.
3. Auto use pricing approaches, including parking taxes, pay-as-you-drive insurance, and other
mechanisms, are being analyzed as possible ways of reducing auto use. Whether and when
such measures might be adopted cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.
Based on these assumptions, the transit leverage effect for New Jersey and its components were
estimated using the assumptions provided in Table 6.6. The land use factor of just under 4x and
the overall factor of about 5.2x are in line with the range of results for North American cities (see
above), especially given the highly urbanized nature of the northeastern New Jersey/New York
transit service area, as summarized in Table 6.7. This analysis implies that holding the rate of
VMT increase to 1%/year is a realistic goal for New Jersey. Table 6.8 shows the calculation of
fuel savings (based on an assumed mileage of 23.31 mpg from 2009 through 2020) and
MMtCO2e (based on 0.0005 Mt per VMT) saved per year.
Costs and Benefits of the Indirect Effects
The literature on the cost per ton associated with reducing GHG emissions through the use of
pricing measures and travel demand management is somewhat uncertain. Growth management
and land use change are obviously very complex policies with many components and therefore
very more complicated cost structures. The cost for TLU-5 is, therefore, a rough estimate that
considers selected study results for the cost of regional pricing, TDM, and land use/growth
management measures.
Two studies of regional pricing measures include cost-effectiveness estimates:
(1) An unpublished study for the NYC metro area conducted for NYSERDA that CCS
completed using the U.S. DOT's TRUCE model for the tri-state metro region.

Based on these two studies, the cost of reducing VMT using auto use pricing mechanisms could
be estimated at about $300/ton. However the federal Congestion Management and Air Quality
(CMAQ) program reports an average for two categories of pricing measures of $399/ton
(converted from 2005 dollars by CCS), without considering benefits. The average of these two
estimates is $350/ton. CMAQ also reports a cost of $311/ton for regional TDM measures.
The cost of policies such as urban growth boundaries and other land use measures is harder to
estimate. Some previous analyses have used a qualitative "less than zero" determination in other
state climate action plans based upon extended stakeholder discussions of the
issues in qualitative terms. There are several studies (most commonly, TRB TCRP "Cost of
Sprawl" study by several authors at Rutgers University) to give basis for this qualitative
judgment. In quite a few states, the stakeholders are comfortable with this
assessment which translates numerically into a 'conservative' estimate of $0/ton.
The recent Moving Cooler report estimates a 'positive cost' associated with local planning efforts
related to rezoning. A "zero" or even negative (cost savings) conclusion could be based upon an
operating assumption that all measures undertaken are 'deregulatory' and relate to release
existing market demand for development that is currently restricted by zoning. Two examples of
deregulatory zoning would be (1) relaxation of height limits on development and (2) changes
from single use zoning to zoning where mixed use development would be allowed occur. A
positive cost, zero cost, and net cost savings are not necessarily inconsistent. The value used in
any given situation would depend on whether or not and to what degree there is a belief that
'upzoning' or removal of a 'single use zoning' district or some other deregulatory zoning would
have the effect of releasing pre-existing market demand for development. Of course results also
depend upon the market conditions for specific locations in question
The staff of the California Air Resources Board has estimated this cost at a “conservative” $100
per MTCO2e, while other studies argue that the cost of such measures is nil. Rather than a cost
of $100 (which we believe is high) or $0 per ton, we elect to use the midpoint of this range or
$50 per ton, recognizing that this is a subject of active research and controversy and that new
findings are likely to appear regularly.
Using the leverage factors from Table 6.6, the average cost per ton of the indirect transit leverage
effects can be estimated as shown in Table 6.9.

Using the weighted average of about $106/ton, we can then estimate the total cost of the TLU-5
measures, from which we need to subtract the indirect effects’ share of the benefits described
below in the discussion of TLU-6 (see Table 6.12).

Combining the costs and the benefits produces the results shown in Table 6.10. The estimated
net cost savings of $484/tCO2e is conservative; Moving Cooler, for example, shows net cost
savings for land use measures of $728/tCO2e.

Doubling transit ridership and enhancing greenhouse
commuting programs (TLU-6)
Improvement and expansion of existing transit service and implementation of new, innovative
transit services can shift passenger transportation from single-occupant vehicles to public transit,
thereby reducing VMT, fuel consumed, and emissions. Public transportation improvements are
also critical to support Smart Growth initiatives, which as discussed above accounts for even
greater reductions in VMT, fuel consumption, and emissions. This mitigation policy involves
action by all levels of government. Table 6.11 summarizes New Jersey Transit’s service levels
for 2006.

In recent years, several states in the United States have established an official policy goal of
doubling transit ridership. This goal of doubling ridership has been included in the official state
climate and energy action plans for Florida 38 , Iowa 39 , and in the draft state climate and energy
plan for the State of New Jersey 40 . The next section examines the feasibility of this goal.
Feasibility of Doubling Transit Ridership
The goal of doubling transit ridership in certain parts of the United States is more than a
rhetorical goal. Increasing concern with petroleum dependence, the growth of GHG emissions,
and associated global climate change have motivated the official adoption of this goal. The goal
of doubling transit ridership may be traced to an influential special report of the National
Research Council’s (NRC) Transportation Research Board (TRB). The report “Making Transit

Work: Insight from Western Europe, Canada, and the United States,” was published by the
National Academy Press as Special Report 257. 41
TRB Special Report 257 included a comparison of public transportation systems in cities in the
United States, Canada, and Western Europe. The report finds that “Ridership levels in Canadian
cities are roughly double those of American cities.” 42 Since the report was released in 2001,
transportation professionals are increasingly recognizing that some of best practices and results
from Canadian cities seem within reach for American cities.
The goal of ‘doubling transit ridership’ can be interpreted in two ways – either as an absolute
ridership goal, or a standardized ridership goal. An example of doubling absolute transit
ridership would be moving from 100,000 to 200,000 total transit trips in a year. Such a goal
would include a ‘natural’ increase in absolute ridership that might be associated with population
growth. An example of doubling standardized transit ridership would be moving from 25 annual
rides per capita to 50 rides per capita. Such a standardized goal would look for ridership
increases over and above those natural increases that might occur from population growth alone.
Neither the ‘absolute’ nor the ‘standardized’ formulation of the doubling goal takes into account
the economic cycle. Commuter traffic increases as a result of higher employment, and to the
extent that the economic cycle results in different levels of employment, both absolute and
standardized ridership would change to some extent as a result. These ‘cyclical’ increases in
transit ridership may be viewed as differing from increases due to structural changes in the urban
environment, although some are influenced by the changing price associated with the cost of
travel.
Based upon a review of standardized transit system ridership data during the 1990s, the TRB
special report found that most Canadian cities have annual transit ridership of between 50 and
100 rides per capita. In contrast, most United States cities have annual transit ridership of
between 0 and 50 rides per capita. This difference in the experience of the two countries suggests
that if some United States cities were to follow a more ‘Canadian’ path, they could double their
standardized transit ridership and have travel patterns more like their counterparts north of the
border.
Six major urban areas in the United States already meet or exceed the Canadian patterns of
public transit usage. The greater New York City region averages 140 transit rides per year per
capita. Five other urban areas in the U.S. – Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and
Washington, DC – have transit ridership greater than 75 rides per capita annually. These five
relatively transit-intensive American cities seem more comparable to Canadian cities, while the
New York City region seems more comparable to the largest urban regions in Canada—Montreal
and Toronto-- and to major western European cities reviewed in the TRB special report, almost
all of which have per capita transit usage levels greater than 100 rides per capita.

As examples of the standardized transit ridership levels of some other cities and urban regions,
the southeast Florida region has about 30 annual transit trips per capita, comparable with the
Atlanta region and southern California. The Orlando area has 15 annual trips per capita, and the
Jacksonville and Tampa-St. Petersburg regions have about 10 annual trips per capita. This data
suggests that there is significant room to grow per capita transit ridership in Florida cities. 43
Just as some U.S. cities and states are envisioning the possibility of following a more “Canadian”
path when it comes to travel patterns, the most transit-intensive American cities may set a goal of
become more like Western European cities in their levels of public transit use, just as New York
City has already done.
For example the greater San Francisco Bay Area metropolitan region shows transit ridership
greater than 75 rides per capita annually, and the City of San Francisco, the most ‘transit-rich’
portion of the metropolitan region, demonstrated transit usage levels of 272 rides per capita in
2005, according to the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). The
SFMTA’s recent Climate Action Plan includes a summary of a plan to increase ridership by up
to 32% in ten years, assuming the availability of additional funding to increase service hours by
25% over 2005 levels. If successful, this increased ridership would result in a per capita ridership
of 334 rides annually. The SFMTA climate plan compares its increased ridership plan to the
example of Zurich, Switzerland, which has a per capita annual ridership of 560. The Zurich level
of per capita transit ridership is roughly two times San Francisco’s 2005 level of 272.
In summary, it appears that the policy goal of ‘doubling transit ridership’ has a resonance and
usefulness for consideration by more cities, urban regions, and states in the U.S. The goal is
flexible in that it takes into account the ‘starting point’ of transit ridership for a given city or
urban region and attempts to build on this starting point. In addition, it implicitly recognizes the
need for expansion of transit service, since it is rarely if ever possible to double ridership with
the existing supply of transit capacity and service.
For this related action, doubling transit ridership by 2020 was analyzed based on data provided
by various New Jersey state and local agencies; the 2020 annual estimates of GHG savings were
also obtained from New Jersey agency reports. Analysis of the cumulative impacts was
conducted using simple spreadsheet techniques with a linear annual ramp-up assumed for the
eleven-year period from 2009 to 2020. Table 6.12 shows the emission reductions estimated for
TLU-6. As noted in Chapter 1, New Jersey Transit’s capital program is being undertaken for
many reasons in addition to GHG reduction, and there is no easy way to allocate that budget
among the various purposes. Since it would be misleading to attribute the entire capital budget to
GHG reduction, no analysis of the costs and benefits of TLU-6 was performed.

Economic Benefits of Transit Investment
There is a broad literature on the role of transit as a part of a modern economy and as a key
contributor to creating and maintaining certain aspects of quality of life. Overarching reviews of
that literature are done only periodically. One of the most comprehensive reviews is Cambridge
Systematics, Inc.'s, Public Transportation and the Nation’s Economy: A Quantitative Analysis of
Public Transportation’s Economic Impact, 1999. The study demonstrates that transit produces
net economic returns on investment nationally:
“Transit capital investment is a significant source of job creation. This analysis indicates that
in the year following the investment 314 jobs are created for each $10 million invested in
transit capital funding.
“Transit operations spending provides a direct infusion to the local economy. Over 570 jobs
are created for each $10 million invested in the short run.
“Businesses would realize a gain in sales 3 times the public sector investment in transit
capital; a $10 million investment results in a $30 million gain in sales.
“Businesses benefit as well from transit operations spending, with a $32 million increase in
business sales for each $10 million in transit operations spending.
“Business output and personal income are positively impacted by transit investment, growing
rapidly over time. These transportation user impacts create savings to business operations,
and increase the overall efficiency of the economy, positively affecting business sales and
household incomes. A sustained program of transit capital investment will generate an
increase of $2 million in business output and $0.8 million in personal income for each $10
million in the short run (during year one). In the long term (during year 20), these benefits
increase to $31 million and $18 million for business output and personal income respectively.
“Transit capital and operating investment generates personal income and business profits that
produce positive fiscal impacts. On average, a typical state/local government could realize a
4% to 16% gain in revenues due to the increases in income and employment generated by
investments in transit.
“Additional economic benefits which would improve the assessment of transit’s economic
impact are difficult to quantify and require a different analytical methodology from that
employed in this report. They include "quality of life" benefits, changes in land use, social
welfare benefits and reductions in the cost of other public sector functions.
“The findings of this report complement studies of local economic impacts, which carry a
positive message that builds upon the body of evidence that shows transit is a sound public
investment. [L]ocal studies have shown benefit/cost ratios as high as 9 to 1.”

77



Other Benefits of New Jersey Transit Improvements
Transit services have a large number of other impacts which provide additional benefits. Transit
service provides mobility, accessibility, and safety benefits that are not included in the analysis
above. Other important co-benefits include improved air quality, public health (e.g., due to
walking), and quality of life. Transit benefits from reducing congestion and facilitating land use
patterns such as transit-oriented development and smart growth are very significant and as noted
are partially reflected in the analysis above.
The provision of transit service provides other more direct benefits and cost impacts. Most
importantly are travel time benefits that accrue to transit users, reduced air pollution, and
congestion relief that affect road users on parallel routes. Reducing VMT and increasing reliance
on public transit will also result in reduced parking demand, lower household costs for
transportation, decreased traffic congestion, improved air quality, reduced need and cost for
roadway expansion, and improved health for new transit riders who walk or bicycle to transit.
Because consideration of New Jersey Transit’ capital and operating expenditures in isolation
could produce a misleading picture of the overall balance of costs and benefits, this analysis
examines certain of the benefits of the New Jersey Transit capital program and the related land
use measures. The benefits examined are those that are most readily quantifiable using
spreadsheet methods.
Many of the benefits of New Jersey Transit’s capital program and the related land use measures
discussed above under TLU-5 stem from the ability of public transit to reduce the use of private
automobiles, as measured by the change in VMT. VMT-related benefits are as follows:
• Savings on fuel and vehicle maintenance costs;
• Reduction in time lost from traffic delays;
• Reduction in number of highway fatalities and injuries;
• Reduction in amount of accident-related property damage;
• Improvements in air quality, as measured by emissions of PM10 and PM2.5; and
• Reduction in GHG emissions, especially carbon dioxide.
Several other benefits cannot readily be measured and are therefore omitted from this analysis:
•
•
•

Gains in quality of life from reduced traffic noise, driving stress, etc.;
Savings on costs of vehicle ownership for those who decide to forego vehicle ownership
(e.g., of second cars); and
Economic multiplier effects (e.g., stimulus to businesses from transit construction projects
(see above)). This gain will be offset to an unknown extent by losses to businesses that
service the highway sector, and a separate study would be needed to evaluate these tradeoffs.

Table 6.12 summarizes the estimated magnitude of the quantifiable direct and indirect benefits
based on New Jersey Transit’s projection of the effect of its capital program on aggregate VMT
in New Jersey. It should be noted that the savings in gasoline consumption depend on the price
78



of gasoline (assumed here at $2.50/gallon). As recent years have shown, that price can fluctuate
by a dollar or more within a relatively short time period, and the magnitude of this particular
benefit is therefore highly volatile.
As Table 6.13 shows the New Jersey Transit capital program and the related land use measures
clearly have very substantial economic benefits that go far to balance the large costs of the
measures and, therefore, improve the cost-effectiveness in terms of mitigating GHG emissions.

Appendix A: Strength of the Transit Leverage Effect
This appendix reports results of some of the more noteworthy studies of the transit leverage
or land use multiplier effect. The studies are listed in order of the magnitude of the effect
found in the study; where a study provided a range of results, the ordering is based on the
low end of the range.
Holtzclaw (2000) compared three prototypical cities in the San Francisco Bay Area (San
Francisco, Walnut Creek and San Ramon), and computed a reduction in vehicle travel of
between 1.4 and 9 for every mile of transit passenger travel.
The most recent major study in this area was done for APTA by ICF and Patricia Mokhtarian of
UC Davis (Bailey, Mokhtarian et al. 2008). This study applied multivariate statistical analysis
using structural equation modeling (SEM) to National Household Travel Survey data to produce
estimates of the 'direct' and 'indirect' effects of transit on VMT, energy consumption, and by
extension, GHG emissions. In contrast to other techniques, which mainly identify correlations
between auto and transit travel, SEM can help explain the extent to which transit causes denser,
more walkable land-use patterns, and conversely the extent to which these land-use patterns
create a need for improved transit service. This study concludes (p. 12) that “the magnitude of
the secondary effect is approximately twice as large as [1.9 times] the primary effect of actual
public transit trips,” The study also found (p. 1) “a significant correlation between transit
availability and reduced automobile travel, independent of transit use.”
After reviewing three major reports of the European Commission on regional scenario analyses
that used “state-of-the-practice methods”, Johnson found that the combination of either auto use
pricing policies or urban growth boundaries with transit provision appears to approximately
double the VMT reduction effect of additional transit investment as compared with transit
investment undertaken alone. Johnston concluded that “we may view these [European]
projections as the upper bounds of what could be achieved in most regions in the U.S.” It is not
clear from the from the Johnston review what would be a reasonable conclusion regarding the
expected combined VMT reduction effect of transit investment and land use intensification near
transit stations.
Bailey and Mokhtarian (2008) found that their model “confirms the hypothesis that public
transportation availability has a significant secondary effect on VMT beyond the primary effect
of using transit. The secondary effect is mainly generated through land use patterns. The
magnitude of the secondary effect is approximately twice as large as the primary effect of actual
public transit trips. This result suggests that public transit is a significant enabler of an efficient
built environment.” 44

The indirect “leverage effect” of public transportation was estimated at three to four times the
direct effect of transit service by the American Public Transportation Association, “Public
Transportation Reduces Greenhouse Gases and Conserves Energy” (4/2008)
http://www.apta.com/research/info/online/greenhouse_brochure.cfm.
In a study of U.S. metropolitan areas with populations of at least 2 million, Pushkarev and
Zupan (1982) documented the empirical observation that cities with high public transit use
show far lower rates of auto travel than would be implied by the direct substitution of auto
with transit trips alone; they found a leverage effect of 4:1.
One of the most influential studies in this area (Newman and Kenworthy, 1999, Sustainability
and Cities, page 87) used a worldwide statistical analysis of cities in a World Bank study to
estimate that the transit leverage effect is between 5:1 and 7:1. In other words, for every one unit
of direct effect from transit investment that results in mode shift, there are between 5 and 7 units
of indirect effect that shows up in the entire transportation system. A good proportion of this
indirect effect is related to the patterns of land development and land use.
In a study of 32 global cities, Newman and Kenworthy (1999) estimate a land-use multiplier of
between 5 and 7, meaning that for every extra passenger mile on transit per capita, vehicle miles
per capita decline by five to seven miles.
Neff (1996) used travel time budget theory to analyze the substitution of transit travel for auto
travel in U.S. urbanized areas. He concluded that every mile of transit travel replaces 5.4 to 7.5
miles of auto travel.
Newman concluded that transit leverage in the U.S. has been found to be 1 in 6 to 7: “[t]hat is,
for every passenger km added to a new transit system that replaces cars there are 6 to 7 passenger
km [kilometers] of car use removed from the city. If the quality of the transit is not as good and
there are large numbers of park and ride facilities provided then it may reduce to 1 in 3. But it is
always more than one.”
More recent, as-yet-unpublished work by Newman, Kenworthy and Glazebrook identifies an
exponential relationship between transit and auto travel: As the use of public transport increases
linearly, auto travel decreases exponentially.
In addition to the empirical research on transit leverage in urban regions around the world and
around the United States, a corroborating body of research from regional modeling and scenario
forecasting studies has made similar findings about the integrative impacts of combinations of
policies, expressed in terms of the percentage reduction in VMT obtainable under various policy
scenarios.
The Sacramento region conducted regional scenario analyses and adopted a plan that reduces
VMT per day by 12.3 miles per household in 2050, with 1.5 million more people in the region
and fuel savings estimate of 75 million gallons per year, with dollar value equivalent of $180
million per year. The California Energy Commission survey of Metropolitan Planning
Organizations in California found results that indicate potential low range estimate for 2.6%

81



reduction in VMT per capita (59,573 billion Btu energy savings) and potential high range
estimate for 10.2 reduction in VMT per capita (233,621 billion Btu energy savings) between
2000 and 2020.
The Center for Climate Strategies, during the course of review of studies, surveyed metropolitan
region results from around the United States. The Center for Climate Strategies’ review found
ranges of estimated VMT reductions for 12 metro regions, including a 4.6% reduction in VMT
for San Francisco Bay Area (Regional Livability Footprint) and a 31.7% VMT reduction in
Sacramento region for Sacramento Blueprint. As a result, Center for Climate Strategies’ analyses
have used a range of 3% to 11% of urban VMT below baseline for the 2020 time frame.
A 2005 Canadian study concluded that “[h]igh transit investment could reduce annual GHG
emissions by approximately 2% relative to the BAU case (2020 year). In terms of TDM
measures, low TDM measures could further reduce annual GHG emissions by approximately 1%
while an annual GHG emissions reduction of approximately 3% could be achieved with high
TDM measures. Therefore, a total of approximately 5% of annual GHG emissions could be
achieved with the implementation of both high transit investment and high TDM measures.” 45
A study sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration
found in the Bartholemew study (2005, 2007) results showing potential for compact
development to on average result in 8% fewer VMT as compared with BAU scenario.
One of the important reviews of regional modeling studies around the world presents good
evidence about the integrated effects of alternative strategies to reduce VMT, fuel use, and
associated emissions. Professor Robert Johnston conducted the review entitled; “Review of U.S.
and European Regional Modeling Studies of Policies Intended to Reduce Congestion, Fuel Use,
and Emissions” The Johnston review looks at 40 long range scenario exercises performed in the
United States and Europe. The main conclusion of the Johnston review is that VMT reductions
for the 20 year time horizon are achievable in the range from 10% to 20% for U.S. regions,
compared to the future trend scenario, while supporting the same level of future job and housing
growth.

Chapter 7
Electricity Generating Units
Introduction
Under this supporting recommendation, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
(NJDEP) will develop an electricity generating unit (EGU) – related rulemaking to establish a
maximum carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions performance standard expressed in pounds of CO2
emitted per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. The proposed performance standard (amount
of CO2 per megawatt (MW) hour of net electricity) would apply to all in-state new fossil fuelfired EGUs and reconstructed EGUs.
Table 7.1 summarizes the estimated greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and net costs for
this supporting recommendation. The supporting recommendation is assumed to totally overlap
in the short run with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which is one of New
Jersey’s core GHG mitigation recommendations. Therefore, the emission reductions and costs
are estimated here for the purpose of understanding the potential impacts of a minimum CO2
performance standard but are not included in the aggregated costs associated with the other
supporting recommendations to avoid double-counting of the emission reductions and costs
associated with RGGI. The remainder of this chapter provides information on the parameters for
analysis, methods, data sources, and assumptions used to prepare the analysis for this supporting
recommendation.

It is likely that the improved air pollution control of new coal-fired integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) units would result in significant reductions in the emissions of criteria
air pollutants, provided existing coal units are retired and replaced with new IGCC units. The
benefits associated with such reductions are not reflected above.

Quantification Methods
The business-as-usual (BAU) scenario for this analysis was defined as the result of the prior
Rutgers projections associated with the development of the Energy Master Plan and was
provided to CCS in order to prepare the analysis. The results of that scenario for generation and
GHG emissions are summarized in Tables 7.2 through 7.4.
New coal generation was defined as incremental generation in excess of 2010 levels. This
generation is assumed to be the subject of the performance standard and would need to be
replaced with baseload power from a facility in compliance with the standard, assumed in the
analysis to be a suitably-sized natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) unit having a CO2e intensity
equal to 0.57 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per megawatt hour
(tCO2e/MWh). The source for the coal-fired generation displaced was assumed to be a
supercritical pulverized coal steam unit. The starting year for the analysis is assumed to be 2011.
Levelized costs were calculated using cost and performance assumptions from a variety of
sources, including the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory
(NETL), ICF International assumptions for Integrated Planning Model (IPM) modeling in the
northeast U.S., and Black & Veatch, an engineering firm. Fuel prices were taken from the US
Department of Energy/Energy Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook (AEO)
2009 results for the mid-Atlantic region. A summary of assumptions appears in the Annex using
a 3% real discount rate. The results are presented in Table 7.4. NPV costs are equal to $162
million, cumulative GHG emission reductions reach 4.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMtCO2e) by 2020, and the cost of avoided GHG is $34.5/tCO2e.

Re:

Microeconomic Impact of CO2 Reduction in New Jersey

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has asked the Center for
Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy (CEEEP) and the Rutgers Economic Advisory
Service (R/ECONTM), both part of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy
at Rutgers University, to analyze the economic impacts of the proposed Supporting
Recommendations prepared in response to Governor Corzine’s Executive Order 54 and the
Global Warming Response Act (GWRA). Both organizations have previously worked together
on behalf of the State to analyze the economic impacts of the State’s Renewable Portfolio
Standard (RPS), the Energy Master Plan (EMP), and the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program.
This memorandum identifies, describes and, where possible, quantifies the economic benefits of
certain of the policies within the Supporting Recommendations including the benefits of
avoiding damages associated with the emission of greenhouse gases and other co-benefits not
related to greenhouse gases. 1 It is organized in the following sections. First, the costs and direct
and co-benefits associated with greenhouse gas emission reduction policies are characterized.
Next, a brief review of economic impact analyses of other jurisdictions’ policies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions is presented. The third and fourth sections quantify, respectively, the
direct greenhouse gas reduction benefits and non-greenhouse gas reduction co-benefits of the
proposed Supporting Recommendations.
I. Identifying and Quantifying the Economic Impacts of Greenhouse Reduction Policies
The emission of greenhouse gases and their associated impact on global climate change presents
policymakers with extensive technical, economic and policy challenges. Different greenhouse
gas reduction measures have different costs. Some measures are economical; the adoption of
such a measure should occur regardless of its greenhouse gas reduction benefits. Energy
efficiency measures generally fall into this category because the energy savings are sufficient to
more than pay for the cost of the measure. Any additional direct benefits, such as a reduction of
greenhouse gases, would only make that measure even more cost-effective. In the work
performed by the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) on the Supporting Recommendations,

1

In this memorandum, the term “co-benefits” refers to benefits of a particular measure other than
those associated with reducing greenhouse gas emissions.



measures that are cost-effective are identified as having “negative” costs (reported per metric ton
of equivalent CO2), indicating that the measure’s benefits outweigh its cost.
Other measures have costs that exceed the narrowly defined economic benefits before their
impact on greenhouse gas emissions and other co-benefits are accounted for. In the work
performed by CCS, these measures are characterized as having a positive cost. The costs of the
policy measures proposed in the Supporting Recommendations are not known with complete
certainty. They are based upon engineering estimates performed prior to the implementation of
the measures. Over time, as more experience is gained with individual measures, their actual
costs may turn out to be different from their estimated costs. Since these measures would be
implemented by the State of New Jersey, the costs associated with them would be borne by the
State’s residents.
The benefits associated with the proposed measures in the Supporting Recommendations can be
categorized in several ways. The most prominent category of benefit is the reduction in
greenhouse gas emissions. Reduced emissions should translate into lower increases in global
temperatures and should therefore lower the net economic and other costs associated with global
climate change. Other benefits may also occur that are not related to global climate changes,
such as reductions in other air emissions or improved flood control. In some cases the
greenhouse gas reduction benefits and the non-greenhouse gas reduction benefits can be
quantified, although the range of uncertainty around specific point estimates may be large. In
other cases, it is not practical to provide any reasonable quantification of these two categories of
benefits; nonetheless these unquantifiable benefits are real and should be considered a part of the
economic impact analysis.
Table 1 summarizes the types of benefits associated with each major category of additional
measures in the Supporting Recommendations.

As a direct consequence of the greenhouse gas effect, the greenhouse gas reduction benefits
occur throughout the world, although New Jersey is particularly affected by global climate
change as discussed in the Supporting Recommendations. Moreover, the greenhouse gas
reduction benefits due to the Supporting Recommendations depend on reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions by other states and countries. The non-greenhouse gas reduction benefits accrue
primarily, if not exclusively, to New Jersey. In many cases, the benefits, whether greenhouse gas
related or not, are uncertain. In other words, wide variations exist among the various estimates of
the economic benefits.

3



How should policymakers respond to the difficulties in both quantifying the costs and benefits
associated with greenhouse gas reduction measures? Despite the relative uncertainties as to the
timing and location of the costs and benefits, substantial actions taken immediately, such as those
proposed in the Supporting Recommendations, are reasonable. Certainly, the above mentioned
issues do not justify inaction or delay. Given the range in costs associated with various measures,
it makes sense, as the State of New Jersey is doing, to pursue the most cost-effective measures
first, subject to regulatory and legislative restrictions. It is also reasonable for the State to
identify, characterize, and in some cases even pursue more expensive measures, even if in some
cases those measures’ costs exceed their expected benefits. As a matter of public policy, the
State may decide that there are issues of equity that justify certain measures even if the strict
economics relating to those measures do not. In addition, the State may be risk-averse and
therefore willing to incur costs that avoid or limit the likelihood of extremely bad climate change
outcomes even if the measures are not strictly justified on an economic basis. Finally, in
identifying and characterizing measures based upon the best information available today, the
State creates the flexibility to pursue these measures in the future when they may be more
economical based upon new and better information.
II. Studies of Economic Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Policies from Jurisdictions
Other Than New Jersey
Florida recently completed a statewide study of the impacts of the Florida Energy and Climate
Change Action Plan on the State’s economy. 2 The Florida Energy and Climate Change Action
Plan designs policies and measures to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases. The report
highlights 28 mitigation and sequestration strategies including energy supply and demand
(Renewable Portfolio Standards, nuclear power and combined heat and power), transportation
and land use (low greenhouse gas fuels and improving transportation system management), and
agriculture, forestry and waste (forest retention and forest management for carbon sequestration).
Most of the strategies discussed in the paper had positive macroeconomic impacts. Overall, the
strategies are expected to increase the Gross State Product by about $33 billion (0.66%). The
study also estimates that about 129,000 full time equivalent jobs (direct and indirect) will result
from the mitigation strategies. This represents an increase of nearly one percent over baseline
projections.
CCS summarized the results of a study designing a regional cap-and-trade system in Michigan. 3
For an economy-wide cap-and-trade system, the net impact on the economy will be positive,
with a cost savings to the Michigan economy of $193 millionby 2020. Overall, the Midwestern
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord States would save $3.6 billion by 2020.

Many other states have recently assessed or are currently in the process of assessing the
economic impacts of climate change policies. Ruth et al. present a case study of the potential
economic and energy impacts on Maryland from its participation in the Regional Greenhouse
Gas Initiative (RGGI). 4 RGGI is the first mandatory market-based effort in the United States to
reduce greenhouse gases from the production of electricity. Ten Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic
states have the goal of capping and then reducing CO2 emissions from the power sector 10% by
2018. 5 Using three models, Haiku, JHU-OUTEC, and IMPLAN, the authors showed that there
would be only a limited impact on the economy and electric power markets in Maryland.
Specifically, RGGI participation lowered net electricity demand by between 1.5 percent in 2010
and nearly three percent in 2025, reduced investment in new generation capacity by nearly 45
percent by 2025, and had virtually no impact on retail electricity prices paid by ratepayers. In
addition, the study showed that RGGI would not lead to significant retirement of existing
electricity generation capacity. Total profits of existing generators would fall by 13 percent in
2010 and 12 percent in 2025, with coal-fired generators experiencing the largest drop. Some of
the economic impacts included an overall electricity bill decrease of $100 million in 2010 and
more than $200 million by 2025, with the average residential ratepayer seeing $22 in annual
savings by 2010, and an overall positive impact on Gross State Product and job growth (0.1
percent, each).
Prindle et al. examined the regional effects of increased energy efficiency investment in the
RGGI framework using the REMI model. 6 The REMI runs showed that RGGI would have a
very small impact on the regional economy. In general, the impact was less than one-tenth of one
percent for key indicators such as gross regional product, personal income and private sector
employment. The authors also note that the REMI runs indicated small but positive individual
economic impacts from RGGI. For example, average household electricity bills are expected to
decrease by about $30 by 2015 and $50 by 2021.
ISO New England conducted its own analysis of RGGI impacts by surveying generators and
stakeholders on likely compliance strategies and potential operating risks, and by using
sensitivity analyses for those factors. 7 The analysis found that four New England states
(Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont) would be able to meet the New England
RGGI cap through 2015 if the CO2 allowance price is $5/ton or higher. New generating
resources would need to have zero or low CO2 emissions to maintain emissions below the cap

after 2015. Leakage from non-RGGI units will be a significant problem for remaining below the
RGGI cap (3 million tons in 2015, allowance cost of $10/ton). The addition of Rhode Island and
Massachusetts would cause CO2 emissions to exceed the six-state cap of 55.8 million tons in
2010 at $5/ton and 2014 at $20/ton.

III. Estimate of the Global Climate Change-Related Direct Benefits from the Proposed
Supporting Recommendations beyond the NJ EMP and LEV Standard
The supporting climate change policy recommendations that are quantified in this section are in
addition to the policy options presented in the New Jersey Energy Master Plan (EMP) and New
Jersey’s Low Emission Vehicle program (LEV). The New Jersey EMP proposes policies that
relate to energy efficiency, renewable energy, and the development of clean energy technologies.
The New Jersey LEV or Clean Car Program implements the California Low Emission Vehicles
(LEV) standard, which contains programs for vehicle emission standards, fleetwide emission
requirements, and a Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) sales requirement.
Emission reductions of equivalent CO2 can be quantified in dollars using estimates for the
negative economic impact per ton of equivalent CO2 emitted. One difficulty in this analysis is the
wide range of estimates for the benefits per ton of equivalent CO2 reduction. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produced a study based on a survey of 100
estimates of this parameter, with ranges from $3 to $95 per metric ton and a mean of $12 per
metric ton. 8 These estimates were used in the modeling effort for the New Jersey Energy Master
Plan (EMP) to estimate the monetary benefits of reducing CO2 through the implementation of the
EMP strategies. 9 The methodology and savings estimates used for the EMP are applied here to
the supporting recommendations. When equivalent CO2 reductions from reduced electricity
usage are excluded, the supporting recommendations reduce equivalent CO2 by 24.8 million
metric tons in 2020 and by 138.8 million metric tons from 2009 to 2020. In the year 2020 alone,
this translates into economic benefits of approximately $65 million as the low estimate, $260
million as a mean estimate, and $2.06 billion as a high estimate, in 2020 dollars. Table 2 lists the
economic benefits of reduced equivalent CO2 emissions from 2010 through 2020. The net
present value of savings from 2009 to 2020 is $291 million as a low estimate, $1.16 billion as a
mean estimate, and $9.22 billion as high estimate. 10 The economic benefits accrue to the global
economy, not just New Jersey’s economy, due to the nature of global warming.

IV. Estimate of the Non-Global Climate Change Related Benefits from the Proposed
Supporting Recommendations beyond EMP and LEV Strategies
In addition to a reduction in equivalent CO2, implementation of the supporting recommendations
also reduces other air emissions that are detrimental to human health and the environment,
mainly SO2 and NOx. SO2 and NOx are the principal pollutants that cause acid precipitation. The
SO2 and NOx emission savings were determined by multiplying the electricity and natural gas
savings for the supporting recommendations by emission factors in the New Jersey Protocols to
Measure Resource Savings. 11 In order to monetize the benefits of emissions reduction, the
reduced emissions were multiplied by forecasted emission permit prices. 12 On this basis, SO2
savings account for $6.3 million and NOx savings account for $10.5 million in 2020 alone. Table
3 shows the estimated economic benefits of reduced SO2 and NOx emissions from 2010 through
2020. The net present value in 2009 dollars of the estimated savings is $27.2 million for SO2 and
$47.6 million for NOx.

Although the economic benefits from reduced emissions are significant, the economic benefits
have a relatively minor impact on the overall state economy. In 2020, taking the mean equivalent
CO2 savings estimates combined with the SO2 and NOx benefits, the overall economic benefit is
$308 million. When compared to the projected total Gross State Product in 2020 of $474 billion,
emission savings benefits only account for approximately 0.06% of New Jersey’s Gross State
Product. 13 By comparison, the New Jersey EMP is projected to have a 0.1% impact on New
Jersey’s Gross State Product, and New Jersey’s Renewable Portfolio Standard is projected to
have a negligible impact on the growth of New Jersey’s economy. 14
The preservation of New Jersey’s natural capital is another benefit of the supporting
recommendations. Natural capital includes the natural assets that provide natural goods
(commodities such as fish and timber), and those that provide ecosystem services. Ecosystem
services include carbon sequestration, pest and disease control, and purification of water and air.
The benefits of New Jersey’s natural capital were quantified in a study performed by the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. 15 To monetize these benefits for the present
study, dollar values per acre were multiplied by the number of acres saved by land type due to
the supporting recommendation. In 2020, this translates in real dollars into approximately $5.7
million in natural goods benefits and $37 million in ecosystem services benefits. Table 4 shows
the economic benefits of preserved natural capital from 2009 through 2020. The net present

Each of the benefits discussed in the previous sections are additive, which means that the
benefits from CO2, SO2, NOx, and Natural Capital can be added together to determine the overall
co-benefit economic impact. The cumulative effects of these co-benefits is almost $350 million
in the year 2020 alone and lifetime benefits are $2.75 billion when using the mean estimate for
CO2 savings.

V. Other Non-Quantifiable Benefits
Even though there are many quantifiable benefits from the supporting recommendations, there
are other benefits of implementing climate change policy options that cannot be economically
quantified. One significant benefit is the reduced dependence on foreign oil. Other benefits that
have not been quantified in this analysis include increased visibility due to the reduction of smog
caused by SO2 and NOx, improved driving conditions due to transportation policy options, and
the cultivation of new businesses and markets aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

16 Note:

There is a sharp drop in benefits from 2013 to 2014, this is caused by the expiration of the RGGI
5-Year Investment Program.

Re:

Macroeconomic Impact of CO2 Reduction in New Jersey – Simulations for NJDEP

The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) solicited the Center for
Energy, Economic and Environmental Policy (CEEEP) and the Rutgers Economic Advisory
Service (R/ECONTM) to analyze the economic impacts of the proposed Climate Action Plan
prepared in response to Governor Corzine’s Executive Order 54 and the Global Warming
Response Act. Both organizations have previously worked together on behalf of the State to
analyze the economic impacts of the State’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), the Energy
Master Plan (EMP), and the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) program.
R/ECON Model
R/ECON™ is home to an econometric model of New Jersey. The model is comprised of over
300 equations, based on historical data for New Jersey and the United States, which are solved
simultaneously. The historical data covers the period from 1970 to 2008. The heart of the model
is a set of equations modeling employment, wages, and prices by industry. In general,
employment in an industry depends on demand for that industry’s output and the state’s wages
and prices relative to the nation’s. Demand can be represented by a variety of variables including
(but not limited to) New Jersey personal income, population, and sectoral output, or U.S.
employment in the sector. Other sectors in the model include population, housing, vehicle
registrations, state tax revenue, and energy. The data for the U.S. comes from IHS Global
Insight, Inc., a national leader in economic forecasting.
Methodology
Eighteen supporting recommendations are proposed to assist in achieving the 2020 greenhouse
gas emissions limit established in the 2007 Global Warming Response Act. The supporting
recommendations affect the following sectors:
¾ Green Buildings;
¾ Waste Management;

¾ Commercial and Industrial Refrigeration and Air Conditioning;
¾ Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration; and
¾ Transportation and Land Use.
CEEEP and R/ECON analyzed the economic impacts of the supporting recommendations; the
environmental benefits of the proposed measures were not accounted for in the analysis. The
baseline forecast for this scenario includes the programs in the EMP, LEV, and the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). The baseline forecast begins in the 2nd quarter of 2009 and
runs through the end of 2020.
CEEEP estimated adjustments of several variables in the R/ECON model over the period from
2010 to 2020 to account for the supporting recommendations. All adjustments were applied to
gross state product in the construction, transportation, and state and local government sectors, or
to prices for vehicles, homes, or commercial and industrial buildings. Additionally, CEEEP
estimated the direct employment resulting from these supporting recommendations, which was
added to the construction and state government job base.
Besides the economic changes, the plan also indicates estimated future energy consumption for
the supporting recommendations that apply to use of electricity, natural gas, diesel fuel, and
motor fuel. Overall consumption of these energy sources has been directly reduced in the
R/ECON model. Due to the interconnectivity of the model (and the economy), total
consumption falls by slightly more in a few areas where no direct changes were made.
Key Assumptions
CEEEP utilized the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) and NJDEP’s September 2009 report,
Analysis of Potential Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions and Costs of Supporting
Recommendations for New Jersey’s Climate Action Plan to develop the adjustments for several
of the R/ECON variables. The following tables provide the key assumptions and data gleaned
from the report and the back-up data provided by NJDEP.
Green Buildings

The Green Buildings recommendations increase the cost of new and existing homes and
commercial buildings. The total costs and benefits and the additional cost per residential home
are shown in Tables 1 (a) and (b) respectively. The energy savings associated with the program
can be found in Table 1 (c).

Terrestrial Carbon Sequestration

The Terrestrial Sequestration recommendation is comprised of five programs that propose
restocking or planting trees in various areas of the state and removing land from the private
sector. Removal of land from the private sector will increase the cost of building new homes.
The annual costs of each program are shown in Table 4 (a) below.
The Urban Forest Canopy/Cover electricity savings were determined using the No Net Loss cost
of electricity. The Sustainable Agriculture fuel savings were determined using the cumulative
acres and cost of diesel per acre provided in the CCS and NJDEP report; see Table 4 (b).

Transportation and Land Use

The Transportation Land Use recommendation is comprised of six programs that aim to boost
transit ridership and the availability of hybrid electric and zero-emissions vehicles (PHEV and
ZEV), reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), improve road infrastructure, and upgrade trucks and
truck stops. 2 The increased availability of hybrid electric and zero emissions vehicles will
increase the price of new cars and light trucks (see Table 5 (a)). The increased prices of new
vehicles and homes will cause an increase in the consumer price index that R/ECON uses for
New Jersey.
The four tables below present the inputs utilized by CEEEP to determine the adjustments to the
R/ECON model variables. The annual incremental vehicle costs for the plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles and zero emission vehicles, annual net costs and savings, and additional annual costs are
shown in Tables 5 (a) and (b). Table 5 (c) shows energy consumption data and Table 5 (d) shows
the key assumptions utilized for the remaining program, Road Infrastructure.

2

Increasing shuttle rail goods movement was not included in the analysis because R/ECON does not account for
changes in rail. The recommendation would have no net result on the economy because wholesale retail will
increase as trucking decreases.

Results
In general, the proposed NJDEP programs have a slightly negative impact on the macroeconomy, as seen in Table 6. By 2020, the scenario shows a 7,000 job (0.2 percent) reduction
from the base case, as well as a small increase in the unemployment rate. There is also a 0.6
percent reduction in real gross state product in 2020, a 0.05 decrease in personal income, and a
0.4 percent increase in the consumer price index. Over the 12 year period from 2008 to 2020 the
program would decrease total job creation by 4 percent, from 158,000 to 151,000.

There are a few areas where the decreases would be greater—the areas where the
recommendations are targeted. The green building program would increase the prices of both
new and existing homes, resulting in a small decrease in residential building permits, a 2.6
percent decrease in existing home sales and a 1.5 percent decrease in new home sales in 2020.
Vehicle prices are likely to rise by as much as 14 percent by 2020 to pay for conversion to low or
no carbon fuel use, with the price of automobiles rising somewhat more than the price of light
trucks. By 2020 vehicle registrations (the proxy for sales) will be 3.3 percent lower in the
NJDEP scenario than in the baseline. Both the number of automobiles and light trucks registered
will decline in the NJDEP scenario compared to the baseline. However, light truck registrations
will fall more steeply, so that they will decrease from 43 percent of total registrations in 2008 to
38 percent in 2020 in the NJDEP scenario, compared to 39 percent in 2020 in the baseline. Retail
sales will be 1.8 percent lower in 2020 in the NJDEP scenario than in the baseline because of the
decrease in both vehicle sales and motor fuel sales. One result of the decline in vehicle sales will
be a decline of 0.3 percent in vehicle miles traveled in 2020 in the NJDEP scenario compared to
the baseline.
Overall tax revenues in 2020 will be 0.3 percent lower in the NJDEP scenario compared to the
baseline. However, in 2020, higher vehicles prices will result in a 4.7 percent increase in motor
vehicle registration fees, while the decline in the number of vehicles and vehicle miles traveled
will result in lower motor fuel tax revenues. Real property transfer tax revenues will also be
lower in the NJDEP scenario because the decline in home sales is larger than the increase in
home prices.
As noted earlier, these results do not reflect the co-benefits that would accrue to the state from
implementing the recommendations discussed in this report. For example, reducing greenhouse
gas emissions emitted by fossil fuel-fired electric generating units will also reduce emissions of
sulfur dioxide and various nitrogen oxides that are air pollutants in their own right as well as
components of acid rain. Certain nitrogen oxides are also ozone precursors, and ozone is known
to have adverse health effects in some circumstances. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions will
also help protect New Jersey’s natural capital, which produces a variety of valuable ecosystem
goods and services. Some of these co-benefits are being quantified in a separate study which is
expected to be completed during the fall of 2009.

It is important to note that energy use under the NJDEP scenario will be 3.3 percent lower in
2020 than in the baseline scenario. The state will lower electricity usage by 3.3 percent, natural
gas usage by 3.2 percent, fuel oil usage (including diesel) by 0.5 percent, and motor fuel usage
by 5.4 percent. See Table 7 for additional energy results. These reductions will help increase the

Total taxes includes about 80% of state tax revenues: gross income tax, corporation business tax, sales tax, motor
fuel tax, motor vehicle fee, transfer inheritance tax, alcoholic beverage tax, property transfer tax, petroleum products
tax, cigarette tax, corporate business and financial institutions tax, and public utility tax.

A Comparison of the R/ECON Baseline and NJDEP Baseline Scenarios
The macroeconomic effects of changes in energy prices and consumption are seen in Table 1.
Most of the effects of the Energy Master Plan policies are marginal. However, they do indicate
that the EMP policies lead to an increase in non-agricultural employment (approximately 18,600
jobs), a decline in the unemployment rate, a 1.7 percent increase in personal income, and a 1.9
percent increase in major state tax revenues. As noted in Section III, the results below do not
include the economic benefits of reducing greenhouse gases in the Energy Master Plan Scenario.
Thus, even without accounting for the greenhouse gas reduction, the economy improves slightly
under the Energy Master Plan Scenario as compared to the Baseline.

The above table does not include the Low Emissions Vehicles (LEV) policy. To compare this
set of data accurately to the latest version the LEV policies must be included. The
macroeconomic effects of changes in energy prices and consumption including LEV are seen in
Table 2. Most of the effects of the Energy Master Plan policies are marginal. However, they do
indicate that the EMP policies lead to an increase in non-agricultural employment
(approximately 16,500 jobs), a decline in the unemployment rate, a 1.7 percent increase in
personal income, and a 1.6 percent increase in major state tax revenues. However, they also
show a tiny decrease in real Gross State Product. Higher vehicle and home prices result in lower
new vehicle registrations and residential building permits, and consequently lower nominal and
real retail sales. The latter results are the consequence of higher vehicle and home prices. Thus
the EMP including LEV produces a mixed set of results for the state’s economy.

Table 3 shows the results of the EMP with LEV using the latest R/ECON model and data
updated through the first quarter of 2009. For the most part the levels of the indicators are lower
than in the simulations from last summer, because of the impact of the recession on the state’s
economy. That is not true of either vehicle registrations or residential building permits. That is
an artifact of the pattern of recovery. Both are quite low during most of the forecast period and
only begin to catch up after 2015. Again, most of the effects of the Energy Master Plan policies
are marginal, although they do indicate that the EMP plus LEV policies lead to an increase in
non-agricultural employment (approximately 18,300 jobs) and a decline in the unemployment
rate. However, they also show tiny decreases in personal income, real Gross State Product.
Higher vehicle and home prices result in lower new vehicle registrations and residential building
permits, and consequently lower nominal and real retail sales and lower tax collections. The
latter results are the consequence of higher vehicle and home prices. Thus the EMP including
LEV produces a mixed set of results for the state’s economy.
