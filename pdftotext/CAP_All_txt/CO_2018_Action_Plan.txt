COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Executive Summary



In Colorado, climate change presents a broad range of challenges.
1

Colorado has warmed substantially in the last 30 years and even more over the last 50 years. Future estimates
2
project temperatures rising an additional 2.5oF to 5oF by 2050. This means the warmest summers from our past
may become the average summers in our future. With increasing temperatures come shifts in snowmelt runoff,
water quality concerns, stressed ecosystems and transportation infrastructure, impacts to energy demands,
and extreme weather events that can impact air quality and recreation. The challenges we face will affect
everyone, and they require collaborative solutions. For communities with inequitable living conditions, such
as low-income and communities of color living in more polluted areas, climate change is likely to exacerbate
existing vulnerabilities.
The goal of this document is to set clear and speciﬁc emission reduction goals for the State of Colorado, to
identify opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and to promote state policy recommendations
and actions that increase Colorado’s state agencies level of preparedness for impacts we cannot avoid. This plan is
organized by key sectors, including water, energy, transportation, public health, agriculture, and tourism, among
others. Each chapter lays out some of the key ways climate change will occur in the state and identiﬁes how
those shifts will likely affect that particular sector, such as how an increase in wildﬁres will affect tourism and
public health or how warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt will affect agriculture and water-resource
planning. In addition, each chapter describes many of the measures that are already being implemented
—by state agencies as well as by local entities and private actors—to address these climatic changes. Finally,
each chapter identiﬁes speciﬁc goals and policy recommendations that can help that sector best adapt to and
mitigate some of the most harmful effects climate change. Because addressing climate change is best addressed
collaboratively, this plan has been developed collectively by the Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”), the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (“CDPHE”), the Colorado Energy Oﬃce (“CEO”), the
Colorado Department of Transportation (“CDOT”), the Colorado Department of Agriculture (“CDA”), the Oﬃce
of Economic Development and International Trade (“OEDIT”), and the Department of Local Affairs (“DOLA”),
with input from stakeholders through a public comment process.
This plan has also been developed to meet the requirements of Colorado Revised Statute § 24-20-111, which calls
for the development of a state climate plan setting forth a strategy to address climate change and reduce greenhouse gas emissions while taking into account previous state actions and efforts. This plan represents advances
in the discussion on how to best address climate change at the state level, however, we know that more
conversations are necessary and we look forward to an ongoing dialog with climate experts and the public.
In 2014 Governor John Hickenlooper released a comprehensive Colorado Climate Plan that promoted state
policy recommendations and actions to help improve Colorado’s ability to adapt to future climate change
impacts and increase Colorado’s state agencies level of preparedness, while simultaneously identifying opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions at the agency level. A lot of progress has been made since the
release of that document, but there have also been signiﬁcant changes in both global and federal climate policy.
Those changes resulted in a need for the State to further clarify its own Colorado speciﬁc goals and objectives
with regard to greenhouse gas emissions emission reductions.
On July 11, 2017 Governor John Hickenlooper signed an executive order committing the state to additional
3
climate action. The executive order declares it to be the goal of the State of Colorado to achieve the following:

v Reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by more than 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025;
v Reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector by 25 percent by 2025 and 35 percent by
2030 from 2012 levels; and

v Achieve electricity savings of 2 percent of total electricity sales per year by 2020.



The executive order also commits the State to:
v Work strategically with any interested utility or electric cooperative on a voluntary basis to maximize use
of renewable energy without increasing costs to taxpayers;
v Create a statewide electric vehicle plan, which can be found here: https://tinyurl.com/COElectricVehiclePlan
v Develop a greenhouse gas emissions emissions tracking rule through the Department of Public Health
and Environment;
v Identify opportunities to partner with local governments on locally-led climate goals and resilience actions;
v Institutionalize the state’s greening government initiative;
v Formalize and expand upon cross-agency actions to provide economic development strategies and other
supportive services to communities impacted by the changing energy landscape, and submit a written
annual report detailing those efforts and accomplishments.
Consequently state agencies are working closely with our partners in the private sector and in local government
to execute and implement the executive order. Achieving these goals will not be easy and will require signiﬁcant
collaboration, but it will also help to safeguard Colorado’s air, natural resources, economy, and way of life for
generations to come. Because climate change is a global issue the State has also joined the United States Climate
Alliance; a bipartisan coalition of states and unincorporated self-governing territories in the United States that
are committed to upholding the objectives of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Additionally, the
Alliance provides an opportunity to share information and best practices, which can help Colorado to further
improve and reﬁne our own Climate Plan.
The various chapters of this plan seek to identify the most signiﬁcant effects of climate change and to delineate
the scope of the issue for future progress. The plan also seeks to highlight the determination and innovative
spirit of Colorado. This determination and spirit are demonstrated by endeavors such as our work with utilities
and local communities to transition to new, clean, and safer forms of power production; our efforts to promote
electric vehicles and build the infrastructure across the state to support them; our commitment to not only
create Colorado’s ﬁrst Water Plan but also ﬁnd ways to fund its implementation; our resolve to tackle water quality
and air quality head on and protect the health of citizens; our push to reduce wildﬁres and protect ecosystems
for wildlife and human beneﬁt, and our efforts to help producers and business save money through energy
eﬃciency. And perhaps most important of all is our collaboration with others—because together we are better.
Colorado is a state full of talented innovators who come together to tackle challenges and overcome obstacles
on a daily basis. That collaboration and creative thinking is at the heart of this plan. The goals, strategies, and
recommendations laid out here—and those we are still working to develop—are commitments by the state to
continue moving us forward and provide Colorado speciﬁc policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt. Over
the coming months state agencies will work to incorporate the goals of the executive order and the measures
laid out in this plan, schedule opportunities for continued collaboration, and continue to ensure that we are
taking steps to clean our air and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in a balanced and responsible way,
while also pursuing adaptive strategies that protect the core elements that make Colorado such a desirable
place to live, work, and play.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN



Introduction

C

olorado is a spectacular, vibrant, and economically diverse state with much to oﬀer residents and visitors
1
2
alike. Annually, tens of thousands of people move here, and millions visit. Our mountains, rivers, and
trails are world renowned—as are our laboratories, breweries, universities, and agricultural products. Yet
the Colorado that we know and love faces real challenges with a changing climate. Our response to a
changing climate is not a partisan issue; rather it is an economic development issue, a public health issue, a natural
resource issue, and an emergency response issue. While the science is not perfect—and we do not know the exact
eﬀects that will result from rising temperatures—we have enough information and conﬁdence in the science to
move forward in addressing this issue in a meaningful way, despite the uncertainty. Practical strategies to address
the threats and impacts of a changing climate will help safeguard our citizens, landowners, and businesses. This
plan sets speciﬁc statewide goals to responsibly mitigate greenhouse gases (“GHG”) and advances our preparations
for the changes we cannot prevent. Being proactive and prepared will ensure that Colorado remains a spectacular,
vibrant, and economically diverse state for generations to come.

The potential impacts of a changing climate are broad and reach across many sectors, as reﬂected in the scope
and content of this report. Impacts range from the resilience of our iconic native species to the durability of our
transportation infrastructure. The state’s natural resources and habitats will experience changes as temperatures
warm, making conditions more suitable for invasive species and increasing potential for more severe wildﬁre. In
3
addition to wildﬁre, other extreme weather events may become more common, ranging from droughts to
4
ﬂoods. Streams that ﬂow from the mountains and into our reservoirs will warm, allowing for higher nutrient and
5
bacteria content in the water; and wildﬁre in watersheds may result in sediment loading from recent burns.
6
Snowpack will likely melt oﬀ several weeks earlier, altering ﬂow regimes for ﬁsh and water users alike. With warmer
temperatures, overall runoﬀ will likely decrease while crops will simultaneously need more water to grow as
7
evapotranspiration rates increase.

As new generations are born and people move to Colorado for its
high quality of life and economic opportunity, agricultural producers
will face additional challenges balancing environmental conditions
8
with the increasing demand to feed Colorado’s growing population.
Protecting the air quality of our state will become increasingly
important and safeguarding public health will be imperative. As heat,
drought, and ﬁre events increase in frequency, additional strain will
be placed on our infrastructure and the pristine locations where
9
people recreate may become more threatened or inaccessible.
This multitude of impacts presents far-reaching challenges throughout the state that requires proactive, coordinated eﬀorts to enable
Colorado to work to protect those resources and to adapt where
necessary. At the same time, eﬀorts to curb GHG emissions 26
10
percent economy wide by 2025 will help to mitigate impacts.
Colorado has warmed 2oF in the last 30 years and 2.5oF in the last
11
50 years (Figure 1-1). This warming has resulted in an increasing
trend in heat waves and, along with other factors, has led to drier
soils, a shift in the timing of peak runoﬀ by one to four weeks, and
12
more frequent and severe wildﬁres. Future estimates project
13
temperatures rising an additional 2.5 to 5oF by 2050. This additional warming will aﬀect our water quantity and quality as well as
our energy development, transportation, public health, tourism,
14
and agriculture. In short, a changing climate impacts all sectors
of Colorado’s economy.

03

1.1 OBJECTIVE OF THIS PLAN
The goal of this document is to set clear and speciﬁc emission
reduction goals for the State of Colorado, to identify opportunities
to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and to promote state policy
recommendations and actions that increase Colorado’s state agencies
level of preparedness for impacts we cannot avoid. This plan is
organized by key sectors that include, among others: water, energy,
transportation, public health, agriculture, and tourism. Each chapter
lays out the key ways climate change will occur in the state and
identiﬁes how those shifts will likely aﬀect that particular sector—
such as how an increase in wildﬁres will aﬀect tourism and public
health or how warmer temperatures and earlier snowmelt will
aﬀect agriculture and water-resource planning. In addition, each
chapter describes many of the measures that are already being
implemented—by state agencies as well as by local entities and
private actors—to address these climatic changes. Finally, each
chapter identiﬁes speciﬁc goals and policy recommendations that
can help that sector best adapt to and mitigate some of the most
harmful eﬀects climate change. Because addressing climate change
is best addressed collaboratively, this plan has been developed
collectively by the Department of Natural Resources (“DNR”), the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (“CDPHE”),
the Colorado Energy Oﬃce (“CEO”), the Colorado Department of
Transportation (“CDOT”), the Colorado Department of Agriculture
(“CDA”), the Oﬃce of Economic Development and International
Trade (“OEDIT”), and the Department of Local Aﬀairs (“DOLA”), with
input from stakeholders through a public comment process.



This plan has also been developed to meet the requirements of
Colorado House Bill 13-1293, codiﬁed as Colorado Revised Statute
§ 24-20-111, which calls for the development of a state climate plan
that sets forth a strategy to address climate change and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, while taking into account previous
15
state actions and eﬀorts. This plan represents advances in the
discussion on how to best address climate change at the state level,
however, we know that more conversations must take place and
we look forward to a continued dialog with climate experts, business leaders, our local partners, and the public to build on what we
have already achieved and to push ourselves to achieve much
greater reductions.
The various chapters of this plan seek to identify the most signiﬁcant
eﬀects of climate change and to delineate the scope of the issue
for future progress. The plan also seeks to highlight the determination and innovative spirit of Colorado. This determination and spirit
are demonstrated by endeavors such as: our work with utilities and
local communities to transition to new, clean, and safer forms of
power production; our eﬀorts to promote electric vehicles and build
the infrastructure across the state to support them; our commitment
to not only create Colorado’s ﬁrst Water Plan but also ﬁnd ways to
fund its implementation; our resolve to tackle water quality and air
quality head on and protect the health of citizens; our push to
reduce wildﬁres and protect ecosystems for wildlife and human
beneﬁt, and our eﬀorts to help producers and business save money
through energy eﬃciency. And perhaps most important of all is
our collaboration with others—because together we are better.

1.2 ADVANCING HEALTH EQUITY AND
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE
Climate change—because it can enhance existing stressors—can
have more of a negative impact on vulnerable populations. This is
due to the inequitable distribution of social, political, and economic
power. These power imbalances can result in systems (economic,
transportation, land use, etc.) and conditions that drive health
16
inequities. As a result, communities with inequitable living conditions, such as low-income and communities of color often living in
more heavily polluted areas, face climate change impacts that can
17
compound and exacerbate existing vulnerabilities. Climate action
requires addressing the inequities that create and intensify community vulnerabilities to increase overall health through strategically
directing investments to improve living conditions for people facing
disadvantage. To eﬀectively mitigate the impact of climate change

on underserved populations throughout Colorado, health equity
and environmental justice considerations need to be embedded in
our planning eﬀorts on energy, transportation, food access, housing,
land use planning, and other systems that aﬀect health outcomes.
Colorado seeks to align programming, communications and
resources to strategically address these needs. This plan attempts
to highlight opportunities for eﬀective policies and programs
where this can be done.

1.3 ONGOING EFFORTS IN COLORADO
Addressing climate change will take a concerted eﬀort by all
Coloradans and involve a two-pronged approach. We must reduce
our own emissions, keeping costs aﬀordable for our citizens, while
still preparing for and adapting to future eﬀects beyond our control.
Colorado alone cannot prevent climate change; it is simply not
possible to reduce our own emissions enough to overcome global
patterns. But we can do our part, and we have made great strides
on this front so far. We rank eleventh in the nation for cumulative
18
19
solar electric capacity and tenth for wind capacity. Our energy
companies have sharply reduced pollutants by transitioning to
20
cleaner burning sources, Xcel Energy now provides 29 percent
carbon-free electricity within Colorado and projects this will con21
tinue to grow. Statewide power plant CO2 emissions decreased
approximately 12 percent from 2012 through 2017, and we have
committed to reduce economy wide GHG emissions 26 percent
22
over the 2005 baseline by 2025.
We have a history of success and have found innovative ways to
address complex issues, in 2004, Colorado became the ﬁrst state to
establish a statewide renewable energy standard (“RES”) by popular
vote, and the RES remains one of the strongest in the nation. In 2010,
the Colorado General Assembly passed the Clean Air Clean Jobs
Act, which has reduced emissions through the conversion of coal23
ﬁred power plants to natural gas and other low emitting sources.
In 2014, we became the ﬁrst state in the nation to directly regulate
24
oil and gas methane emissions. Yet we know there is still more
that needs to be achieved if we are to reduce the impacts of a
changing climate. On July 11, 2017 Governor John Hickenlooper
signed an executive order committing the state to additional climate
action. The executive order sets forth the following statewide
25
goals:

04



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

v Reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by more than
26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025;

v Reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector
by 25 percent by 2025 and 35 percent by 2030 from 2012
levels; and

v Achieve electricity savings of two percent of total electricity
sales per year by 2020.
The executive order also commits the State to:

v Work strategically with any interested utility or electric
cooperative on a voluntary basis to maximize use of
renewable energy without increasing costs to taxpayers;

v Create a statewide electric vehicle plan, which can be found
here: https://tinyurl.com/COElectricVehiclePlan

v Develop a greenhouse gas emissions tracking rule through
the Department of Public Health and Environment;

v Identify opportunities to partner with local governments on
locally-led climate goals and resilience actions;

v Institutionalize the state’s greening government initiative;

v Formalize and expand upon cross-agency actions to provide
economic development strategies and other supportive
services to communities impacted by the changing energy
landscape, and submit a written annual report detailing
those eﬀorts and accomplishments.
Colorado’s state agencies are actively involved in carrying out the
executive order as well as continued implementation of ongoing
initiatives, working to drive down emissions and move Colorado
towards a future more resilient to changes in climate. These eﬀorts
are moving us in the right direction, and as we continue to make
progress towards, and ultimately achieve, these goals it will be critical
for the State and our partners to further build on these eﬀorts to
ensure that our actions continue to drive down emissions and are
commensurate with what is needed to achieve our long term
objectives.
Despite our eﬀorts, some eﬀects from a warming climate cannot
be entirely prevented, and Colorado will have to adapt. Some eﬀects
are already apparent (such as earlier spring runoﬀ and increased
drought and wildﬁre), while others are further out on the horizon.
Our state agencies have begun to incorporate these changes into
recovery and resiliency eﬀorts, such as the Colorado Resiliency
Framework, the State Wildlife Action Plan, and throughout Colorado’s
Water Plan, which sets forth strategies, policies, and actions to meet

05

our water needs. Proactive preparedness will enable Colorado to
respond in a timely and cost-eﬀective manner, despite uncertainty,
while also providing the chance to look for opportunities resulting
from these changes.
This Climate Plan builds on the solid foundation and ensures we
take a collective, common sense approach to address this pressing
issue, while holding ourselves to high but achievable goals. Lastly,
and perhaps most importantly, state government is working
together and with public and private-sector experts across the state
to share the knowledge that we have, the innovation we have
developed, and our collective capital. Colorado is a resilient state,
and together we are well positioned to face this challenge.

n Colorado’s semi-arid environment, water inﬂuences nearly all aspects of our economy. On average, the state
as a whole receives only 17 inches of precipitation annually, ranging from 7 inches in the San Luis Valley to as
much as 60 inches in the mountains.1 Snowpack is our biggest reservoir and the source of 70 percent of our
surface water. Yet, in the past 30 years Colorado has warmed substantially, bringing earlier snowmelt, shifting
peak runoff by as much as a month, and increasing drought severity.2 At the same time, demands for water
resources continue to increase as populations grow and warmer temperatures drive up crop irrigation requirements. While Colorado is no stranger to a variable climate, these trends are likely to continue and may become
more pronounced in the coming decades as Colorado warms an additional 2.5oF to 5oF by mid-century.3

The ability to adapt and remain ﬂexible is the key to increasing Colorado’s climate resiliency in the water sector.
How we use and manage our limited water resources will determine our ability to respond and react to the
effects of climate change. Adaptation in the water sector can come in many forms, from infrastructure and regulatory changes to better integration of climate science into water planning. Proactive and integrated planning,
collaboration and implementation will increase our options as effects become more apparent in the future.

2.1 WATER SUPPLY
Four major river systems have headwaters in Colorado (the Arkansas, the Colorado, the Platte, and the Rio
Grande),4 producing approximately 15 million acre-feet of water annually. Of that we consume roughly 5 million acre-feet, and the other 10 million acre-feet ﬂow out of Colorado to 18 downstream states and Mexico.
Agriculture consumes the majority of water (89 percent); municipalities consume 7 percent, while large industry consumes the remaining 4 percent.5 Large swings in Colorado’s water supply from year to year are common, and a series of reservoirs exist to hold water from winter and spring precipitation and deliver it when
demand is greatest, during the summer months. However, climate change threatens to alter how and when
precipitation falls in the state, and warmer temperatures will affect runoff, streamﬂow, evaporation, and soil
moisture. Examining how our most precious natural resource will be affected and working to conserve and
adapt where necessary will help to ensure a more secure water future.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Over the past nine years, the CWCB has produced or participated
in several studies and assessments of how climate change will
affect water resources, with those ﬁndings reported in: Climate

The Joint Front Range Climate Change Vulnerability Study,8 the
Colorado Drought Mitigation and Response Plan,9 the Colorado

watersheds17 may also help to safeguard environmental and
recreational water needs as well. Scientists expect that if temperatures continue to increase, the range of suitable habitat for coldwater ﬁsh species will diminish.18 Ecosystem health is further
discussed in Chapter 9.

have beneﬁcial effects on both water quality and supply. Healthy agreements will provide more options to meet demands in the
future and temporarily supply water from one region or sector to
another. A few major potable reuse projects have been com-

09



pleted in Colorado, and momentum toward researching direct
potable reuse as a source of supply is increasing. Water reuse can
ﬁll a critical gap in water supply availability, but better understanding is also needed of how reuse may decrease return ﬂows and
affect downstream users.23 Nevertheless, these are also subject to
the effects of climate change, and that should be closely examined
before enacting agreements.
In addition, because of the variability that exists in Colorado’s
climate—with both ﬂoods and droughts commonly occurring—
Colorado may require additional storage. Increased storage will
enable water to be held during times of surplus and released
when demand is greatest. This could substantially aid users, such
as farmers and municipalities, who have the greatest demand for
water in the summer months when peak runoff has already passed.
Because of the challenges that exist in building new reservoirs,
additional storage may instead come from enlargement or reallocation of existing reservoirs, thereby making better use of infrastructure already in place. Some may also look to Aquifer Storage
and Recovery where feasible. Dam enlargement can be less costly,
less environmentally harmful, and somewhat less contentious
than construction of entirely new storage facilities, making it a
more ideal solution to meet our additional storage needs. The
Colorado Division of Water Resources is analyzing opportunities
throughout the state where enlargement potential exists.24 Further
exploration of these opportunities may help increase the state’s
climate resilience. Climate change should be considered to the
extent practicable to maximize the usefulness of the overall project
goals and objectives.
Efforts to decrease the amount of energy and greenhouse gases
required for water transport should also be considered to reduce
overall emissions. The energy-water nexus is complex, as production of one depends on the other. Water is often used to generate
power, and power is often required to move and treat water. How
we untangle this nexus in the coming years may inﬂuence overall
emissions. Further discussion of the nexus between water and
energy is included in Chapter 5.

Environmental Protection Agency has the ability to make modiﬁcations that will afford utilities more ﬂexibility to adapt to climate
change, while in other instances increasing ﬂexibility would
require changes to existing law. The state should work with utilities
and federal agencies to proactively identify and address these
concerns and streamline processes.25
As Colorado works to ensure a secure water future, we do so with
a long history of dealing with uncertainty. Economics, population,
and land use are all elements we have factored into long-term
planning in the past. Now as we continue moving forward we
must factor in the uncertainties that a changing climate also brings.
Scenario planning, a technique used by Colorado’s Water Plan and
the Statewide Water Supply Initiative, is a comprehensive way to
look at—and better understand—the array of uncertainties we
face concerning our water future. As a result, climate change is an
integral element sewn throughout water planning in Colorado.
To better understand where we are going we also need the data
to understand where we are. Consequently, we should invest in
and maintain a climate-monitoring network for Colorado to
provide complete and accurate data to compare to the projected
changes. Quality data on current and past conditions will help us
to make more-informed policy decisions, provide a glimpse of
our trajectory, and guide us how to best prepare. This is especially
relevant for the management of our limited water resources, which
are unique in that they have the ability to affect “almost all aspects
of society and the economy, in particular health, food production
and security, domestic water supply and sanitation, energy,
industry, and the functioning of ecosystems.” 26 Currently, Colorado
has a patchwork of monitoring stations unevenly distributed
across the state, whereas neighboring states, such as Oklahoma,
have a comprehensive system designed to measure weather
events at a county or sub-county level.27

As utilities seek new supplies they must also meet environmental
regulations that are predicated on ﬁxed regulatory standards that
may become more diﬃcult to comply with in a warming climate.
For example, utilities must abide by the Safe Drinking Water Act
as well as the Clean Water Act, both of which set standards that
are likely to be affected by a warming climate. In some instances

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Figure 2-1
Projected change in municipal water
diversions (acre-feet) with range of
climate change increases.
This graphic illustrates increases in projected municipal
diversions as a result of population growth (dark blue
bar). The box and whisker plots show the possible
range of increase from climate change (0 to 8 percent), while the light blue box represents the median
projected increase of 4 percent.

2.2 WATER DEMANDS
Colorado’s greatest water demands come from agriculture and
municipalities, both of which are sensitive to weather conditions
during the summer months when demand is the greatest. As
temperatures increase, both sectors will experience increases in
demand as a result. The degree to which climate change could
affect demands varies across the state because of differences in
climate zones, outdoor irrigation requirements, potential temperature increases, and potential changes in precipitation.28
The effects of climate change on annual municipal diversions (in
acre-feet) are projected to range from 0 to 8 percent (Figure 2-1).29
If Colorado experiences a future where population increases, the
climate warms, and precipitation decreases (a scenario developed by the Interbasin Compact Committee and known as hot
growth),30 an additional million acre-feet annually may be
needed by mid-century to meet demands. However, if Colorado
experiences slower population growth coupled with historical
temperature conditions, the additional annual demand, beyond
2008 levels, is approximately 600,000 acre-feet.31 This represents
both indoor and outdoor demands.

11

Higher temperatures will also affect irrigation requirements for
municipal outdoor irrigation demands as increasing evapotranspiration rates mean urban grasses will require more water. Shifting to lower-water-use vegetation may help to alleviate pressure
on municipal water providers. Acceptance of these landscapes
has grown dramatically over the last 15 years as Colorado municipalities have increased their education and outreach resulting in
increased water-use eﬃciency. Nevertheless, as population continues to grow so too will overall demand for water. Increased
water-use eﬃciency will help to ensure that resources are used
wisely. Colorado municipalities have made great strides on this
front over the past 10 years, decreasing their per-capita demands
by approximately 20 percent, integrating long-range demand
planning into broader water-resource planning, and implementing water-eﬃciency best practices at an ever-increasing rate.32
Today, Denver Water, the municipal water provider for Colorado’s
largest metropolitan area, has a treated-water demand that is less
than the treated-water demand of 1980, despite a steadily increasing population.33
Agricultural producers are perhaps the most aware of the importance of water and the effects of shortage. Working with producers and water providers alike to design ﬂexible options that allow
them to manage their water rights in ways that beneﬁt their businesses, communities, and lands is also important as agriculture
demands for water increase under altered climatic conditions.



Figure 2-2
Projected agricultural water demands
(acre-feet) with range of climate
change increases.
This graphic illustrates increases in projected agricultural consumptive-use water demands as a result of
climate change (light blue box) in addition to crop
consumptive demands (dark blue bar). The decline in
the dark blue box illustrates the projected decrease
in agricultural production acres over time. The box
and whisker plots show the range of increase from
climate change, 2 to 26 percent. The light blue box
represents the median projected increase of
12 percent, which is based on the “low agricultural
use” scenario and, due to a projected decrease in
production, falls below current levels of agricultural
consumptive use.

While variability will exist across the state, higher temperatures
and longer growing seasons in the future could increase water
consumption anywhere from 2 to 26 percent on agricultural lands
in production (Figure 2-2).34 More frequent or severe droughts
could also affect agricultural production and slow economic agricultural activity. During the 2012 drought, the state experienced
foregone agricultural revenues of $409 million and an additional
loss of $317 million in secondary spending in local communities.35
In western Colorado, crops alone are likely to see an increase in
annual irrigation requirements ranging from 8 to 29 percent on
average by 2040 and 20 to 43 percent on average by 2070.36 This
is, in part, a result of a longer growing season that may extend
anywhere from a week to more than a month.37 In some regions
of the state, a longer growing season may result in increased agricultural production, provided adequate water is available. This
may help to bolster local economies and increase food security.
However, in areas where suﬃcient water is not available, this
increase in crop irrigation requirements could affect producer’s
ability to sustain some crops.

2.3 WATER QUALITY
Water quality and water quantity are inextricably connected; both
are vital for Colorado’s future. Managing both conjunctively is
important for the continuation of the state’s healthy environment,
diverse economy, and quality of life. It is not suﬃcient just to have
enough water, but that water also must be of high enough quality
for the many ways Coloradans use it, from drinking and wildlife
protection to agriculture and recreation. This is especially true given
climate projections that include potential water quality impacts
on Colorado’s water supply.38
While location-speciﬁc effects are diﬃcult to ascertain with available data, broader analysis shows that warming air temperature,
changes in streamﬂow timing, decreased streamﬂow, increased
stream and lake temperature, and an increase in wildﬁre and other
watershed disturbances could have the following effects:

v Higher concentrations of pollutants including metals,
sediment, nutrients, and salinity.39

v Impairment of aquatic organisms that live in cold-water
habitats, such as trout.40

v Increasing the range of non-native ﬁsh species into coldwater habitats that may harm native ﬁsh species through
increased predation and competition.41

12



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

v Increasing levels of organic matter such as algae and thus
increased disinfection byproducts that are costly to remove
to meet drinking-water quality standards.42

v Increases in erosion and sediment transport.43
v Changes in nutrient and sediment loads.44

At the state level, water quality and quantity are managed separately based on different constitutional, statutory, and regulatory
provisions. However, state and federal statutes that protect instream water quality recognize the importance of protecting water
rights while still providing the authority to impose water pollution
controls. The federal statute protecting drinking water quality also
recognizes integration with water quantity by including protections
for source water that reduce treatment costs. Over the past 40
years, Colorado water quality management programs have worked
to ensure clean water for uses such as growing crops, providing
drinking water, and enjoying water-based recreation. Multiple
state agencies work collaboratively to address potential effects on
water quality from climate change.
As Colorado prepares for potential climate change impacts, an
improved integration of water quality and quantity planning and
management activities is crucial. Opportunities to minimize future
impacts must be prioritized to ensure Coloradans continue to have
access to safe and clean water. Locally, watershed coalitions exist
in some areas to address overall watershed health and restoration
in a multi-stakeholder, multi-objective manner.45 At the state level,
Colorado state agencies will work with regulators to modify existing standards that are set on static climate conditions, such as
streamﬂow temperatures, so that those being regulated are able
to reasonably meet the rules under a changing climate.

13

Water: A Health Equity and Environmental
Justice Perspective
Access to safe and healthy drinking water is an essential
human right and a key component of health equity and
environmental justice. Ninety-eight percent of Coloradans
served by community public drinking water systems have
access to water that meets all health-based standards.
That said, as compared to more affluent communities,
underserved communities are disproportionately served
tap water with aesthetic challenges—such as unusual
color or odor—that, while not posing health risks, may
nevertheless cause consumers to question water safety.46
The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),
the longest running and largest ongoing collection of
public health behavior data in the United States, found in
2011 that participants in the lowest income group (less than
$15,000 annually), were more likely to spend financial
resources on bottled/vended water (27.3 percent) than
those in the highest income group (12.1 percent) (more
than $50,000 annually). In addition, higher rates of bottled/
vended water consumption were observed in Black and
Hispanic participants (30.0 percent and 30.6 percent,
respectively) than in Whites (11.9 percent).47 Other research
also suggests that these negative perceptions, particularly among immigrant Latino populations in the U.S., are
associated with a higher consumption of bottled water,
juice, and sugar-sweetened beverages, contributing to
incidences of obesity and oral health problems.
Organizations such as the Colorado Department of Public
Health and Environment (CDPHE), Denver Water, and
Delta Dental are working to dispel misconceptions among
immigrant and minority communities about the safety of
Colorado’s tap water. As climate change progresses and
populations increase, there may be an increase in water
sources with less desirable quality, which could lead
to more communities with more expensive and/or less
desirable drinking water. Continued education and
policy work will be needed to ensure that all of Colorado’s
people have access to clean, affordable and healthy
drinking water.



2.4 EXTREME EVENTS
In nine out of every ten years, a portion of the state experiences
some level of drought conditions.48 While some type of ﬂooding
occurs every year in our state, major ﬂood disasters strike less
frequently—on the order of once every decade.49 These extreme
events carry natural, economic, and societal burdens; and it is
important to understand how climate change may affect the
frequency, duration, and intensity of these natural hazards.
Globally, models indicate that the frequency and magnitude of
extreme precipitation is projected to increase.50 The projections
for Colorado generally indicate that cool-season heavy precipitation events will follow this global tendency towards increasing
frequency and magnitude in the future, but summer extreme
precipitation events may not increase. And our paleoclimate
record shows droughts that are longer lasting and more intense
than those experienced in the twentieth and early twenty-ﬁrst
centuries (Figure 2-3).51 Coupled with increased temperatures
that indicate more drought, longer growing seasons, and higher
rates of evapotranspiration, these projections reinforce that the
past should not be the only mechanism used to plan for the
future and that planning for multiple possible futures with a range
of variability will increase overall preparedness.

When ﬂood and drought extremes are directly examined under
future climate conditions, considerable variability exists across
the state. On the Colorado River at Cameo, the average intensity
for drought events is projected to be somewhat greater than the
historical intensity (-24 percent versus -19 percent respectively);
however, the intensity of surplus spells is considerably lower than
the historical surplus (27 percent versus 46 percent, respectively).
When the range across the different climate projections is considered, future projected drought intensities for the same length
event range from -19 percent to -32 percent; while surplus intensities range from 17 percent to 38 percent. The frequency of such
events depends on which climate projections are used.52 In most
projections, droughts become more severe, and wet spells are
not as wet, compared to historic conditions. However, studies do
indicate that the intensity of short duration intense rainfall events
may increase in a warmer climate. This is concerning as these
events can often be associated with ﬂooding.53
This range of uncertainty can make planning diﬃcult, but it is
certain that these extreme events will continue in Colorado.
Being prepared for a variable climate will increase our resilience
going forward. For example, the Colorado’s Water Plan and the
Statewide Water Supply Initiative use a scenario approach to plan
for multiple plausible futures. This approach helps to ensure that
the state is prepared for whatever future is realized. In addition,
the state offers drought planning and implementation grants
through the Water Eﬃciency Grant Fund,54 tools and resources,
and technical assistance for improved drought preparedness. The
Colorado Resiliency and Recovery Oﬃce spearheads efforts to help
the State of Colorado and communities increase their resilience
through implementation of the statewide Colorado Resiliency
Framework, which guides Colorado’s ongoing support of local
resiliency planning and implementation efforts and serves as a
resource for local communities, businesses, and individual citizens.
Efforts include building resiliency into disaster recovery as well as
taking proactive, everyday measures that set communities up to
thrive and minimize effects from changing conditions and threats.
Recent collaboration between various state agencies and local
governments provide an example with how this process can breed
success. The Framework provides a starting point to guide activities that will be undertaken, and climate change is a piece of this.55

2.5 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS
There are opportunities to develop strategies and incentives that
help to build a more resilient Colorado under a changing climate.
Colorado’s Water Plan describes water policies aimed at increasing
climate resilience within Colorado’s water sector. The following
are possible approaches that support the work and build on the
foundation laid by Colorado’s Water Plan. They are listed in no
particular order.

v Promote and encourage water eﬃciency and/or
conservation at the local and state agency level.

v Encourage water providers to do comprehensive integrated
water resource planning, geared toward implementing
the best practices at the higher customer participation
levels to achieve state endorsement of projects and
ﬁnancial assistance.
v Support water sharing agreements where feasible and
cost effective.
v Explore options to increase reuse of fully consumable water.
v Encourage opportunities for reservoir enlargement
statewide (where feasible and cost effective) that could be
used for municipal, agricultural, recreational and environmental purposes.

15

v Support improvements in Colorado’s water infrastructure
system by providing low-interest loans and grants, and
encourage partnerships and resource-sharing with federal
agencies.
v Promote and encourage drought preparedness through
comprehensive drought planning and mitigation
implementation.
v Identify climate change risks related to integrated water
quality and water quantity management.
v Incorporate climate variability and change into long-term,
statewide water planning efforts.
v Work with regulators to modify existing water quality
standards to factor in climatic change into regulations.
v Work with utilities and federal agencies to identify and
address regulatory barriers to climate preparedness and
adaptation.
v Assist local communities in building resilience through
the development and implementation of regional and
local resiliency plans.
v Collaborate across jurisdictions to protect and restore
ecosystems associated with healthy watersheds Fund and
enhance existing weather monitoring systems.
v Fund and enhance stream and lake quantity and quality
monitoring.

limate change poses a threat to human health. The impacts on human health are significant and
2
varied. Air quality, water quality, vector-borne disease, and extreme weather events, among other areas,
3
are all public health concerns. While some uncertainty exists regarding the direct correlations between
climate change and public health, Colorado is working proactively on a number of fronts to ensure the
protection of public health and the environment.
This chapter discusses Colorado’s current and proposed strategies for reducing and adapting to a number of
significant climate-related public health effects. These strategies include air pollution reduction strategies,
environmental policies and regulations, disease and risk monitoring, public outreach, and emergency response.
Greenhouse gas mitigation is addressed in Chapter 4 and water quality is addressed in Chapter 2. Colorado will
continually assess the effectiveness of its mitigation and adaptation measures and refine them as appropriate.

3.1 ACTIONS TO MITIGATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
3.1.1 OZONE
Ozone is a pollutant that causes airway inflammation, coughing, throat irritation, decreased lung function, and
other respiratory symptoms. Emissions from automobiles, power plants, oil and gas facilities, and other human
activities have raised ozone concentrations above naturally occurring background levels. Climate change
and higher temperatures appear to be associated with increased ozone formation and increased emissions of
4
volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and nitrogen oxides, which are ozone precursors. Research published
since the 2015 Colorado Climate Plan provides additional evidence that climate change is likely to result in
5
higher ozone concentrations.
Three-year average ozone concentrations for 2015-2017 exceed federal standards in the Denver Metropolitan/
North Front Range “DMNFR”) nonattainment area. This problem is not new, and Colorado has a well-developed
strategy for reducing ozone concentrations and limiting the public health impacts. Ozone concentrations
fluctuate, but even as Colorado’s growing economy, population, and vehicle fleet bring new sources of emissions
to the state concentrations have gradually improved over time. Figure 3-1 shows the gradual decrease in
ozone concentrations between 2000 and 2017 at the monitoring stations in the DMNFR nonattainment area
6
where the highest concentrations have been observed. Continued efforts will be needed to meet the new
7
federal standard of 70 parts per billion, which EPA adopted in 2015 —especially as climate change and interna8
tional emissions push background ozone concentrations higher.
19



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Figure 3-1
8-Hour Ozone—3-Year Average
of 4th Max

Colorado mitigates ozone concentrations and the health impacts
of ozone through regulatory and non-regulatory measures.
9
Colorado adopted an Ozone Action Plan in 2008, set a national
precedent in 2014 by adopting rules to limit the emissions of
10
both methane and VOCs from oil and gas operations, and revised
its State Implementation Plan—an EPA required plan for reducing
ozone—in November 2016. The 2016 State Implementation Plan
revision contains several emission control measures, including air
quality regulations, vehicle emission inspections, transportation
measures, incentive programs, and public outreach, among
others. It estimates that within the ozone nonattainment area,
anthropogenic emissions of VOCs will decrease by 33 percent
11
and nitrogen oxides by 27 percent between 2011 and 2017.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment
12
(“CDPHE”) revised the ozone rules on November 16, 2017 to
further reduce VOC emissions. Many of Colorado’s ozone control
strategies have the co-benefit of reducing methane or carbon
dioxide emissions.

The CDPHE uses the data to monitor long-term progress as well
13
as to issue Air Quality Advisories, an important adaptation tool
that allows at-risk individuals to avoid exposure by remaining
indoors on days when ozone levels are high.

3.1.2 PARTICULATE MATTER
Particulate matter is a mixture of small particles and liquid
droplets in the air. Industrial facilities, automobiles, combustion,
and even dust contribute to particulate matter. High levels of
particulate matter in the atmosphere affect public health and
welfare and can cause death among people with respiratory conditions. Dust storms related to high winds and increasingly dry
soils occur more frequently in the Southeast, South-central, and
14
Western Slope regions of Colorado. Drought in these areas can
significantly exacerbate blowing dust problems. Figure 3-2 shows
a severe dust storm, one of seven Colorado dust storms tracked
during the winter of 2012-2013.

Colorado mitigates these effects through statewide particulate
15
matter regulations. All areas of the state now meet federal

and sweeping, wood burning, and other activities that emit or
16
contribute to particulate matter in the atmosphere.

20

State and local government agencies in Colorado work cooperatively to minimize the spread of vector-borne diseases. The CDPHE
tracks a number of diseases and publishes an annual assessment.
Colorado has set a goal of developing an electronic disease
reporting system to improve the state’s ability to monitor, detect,
and respond to outbreaks or unusual trends in infectious
2
diseases. Colorado will continue to evaluate disease rates and
possible links to climate variables.
Prevention, monitoring, and reporting are important tools to mitigate and adapt to the effects of vector-borne diseases. Colorado
will continue to notify the public of disease outbreaks and prevention techniques. If changes in the nature and extent of vectorborne diseases become apparent, mitigation and adaptation
strategies will be coordinated into statewide plans as appropriate.

While Colorado has been successful in reducing anthropogenic
particulate matter emissions, high particulate matter emission
concentrations from blowing dust remain a problem. To address
these periodic episodes, Colorado maintains a surveillance
program to evaluate blowing-dust and public-health threats.
Blowing-dust advisories are issued to inform residents about
these events. Each advisory suggests simple actions individuals
can take to protect themselves and their families. The advisory
protocols are incorporated into local air-quality plans.
The state will continue to implement its particulate matter regulations and plans in accordance with the Clean Air Act. The CDPHE
will monitor, evaluate, and report events where particulate
health standards are exceeded. The CDPHE will periodically revise
Colorado’s particulate matter regulations and State Implementation Plans and will adopt additional measures to reduce emissions
as necessary and appropriate to meet air quality standards.

3.2 VECTOR-BORNE DISEASE
A number of studies have projected increased incidence of vector17
borne diseases as temperatures warm because of climate change.
Studies indicate that the spread of West Nile virus is, in part,
18
related to climatic conditions. Hantavirus and some tick-related
diseases have been associated with heavy rainfall and other
19
meteorological conditions. However there is uncertainty regarding these associations, and they vary depending on the specific
20
vectors, meteorology, ecology and epidemiologic factors.

3.3 HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS
In many of Colorado’s water bodies, large-scale blooms of algae
have been occurring more frequently, due to higher nutrient loads
22
and increasing ambient surface water temperatures. One type
of algae known as blue-green algae, or cyanobacteria, is capable
of producing harmful toxins and thus presents an ecological,
public and animal health threat. Lengthier warm weather seasons
are also increasing the number of months of the year that blooms
23
are likely to occur.
Multiple state and local government agencies in Colorado work
cooperatively to monitor and respond to blooms of potentially
toxic algae. The CDPHE tracks cyanobacterial test results and
24
reports the presence of toxins online. Colorado has already
begun to work collaboratively to standardize and improve the
state’s ability to monitor, detect, and respond to harmful algae
blooms. Resources to guide water managers on when and how to
sample, test, interpret, and respond to positive test results were
created in 2017 and include public health actions, such as posting
no contact advisories in affected areas. CDPHE will also continue
to work with the Rocky Mountain Poison and Drug Center and
local public health agencies to investigate illnesses reported to
be associated with toxic algae.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

3.4 FOOD-BORNE ILLNESS
There is a known seasonality for foodborne and enteric pathogens,
25
with higher rates of illness during warmer months. Changing
global temperatures are likely to yield more days of warm
26
weather per year, resulting in higher rates of enteric disease.
Possible reasons for increased enteric disease in warmer months
include increased pathogen load in grown food items (produce),
increased lapses in food safety and temperature (in prepared
27
foods), and human behavior around food. Warming sea surface
temperatures are also contributing to increased pathogens in
seafood, such as vibrio parahaemolyticus in oysters, which are
28
distributed throughout the United States. Extreme weather
events, such as high rain and flooding, are associated with in29
creased enteric pathogens, such as Salmonella. Extreme weather
events may also impact parasite burden in feed animals, increasing risk among farm workers.

In addition to their effects on physical health, natural disasters are
33
associated with mental health problems. Wildfires, floods, and
severe weather can cause extreme anxiety or long-term mental
health problems such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder,
or suicide. Longer lasting events, such as droughts, may also have
34
adverse mental health effects.

3.5.1 EMERGENCY RESPONSE SYSTEM
Colorado maintains a robust emergency response system that
uses an all-hazards approach. These programs help Colorado
mitigate and adapt to the public health effects of emergencies or
disasters. The Colorado Department of Public Safety, Division of
Homeland Security and Emergency Management (DHSEM),
manages and coordinates emergency operations at the state level.
The DHSEM implements a comprehensive all-hazards emergency
management program that includes activities and services covering the four phases of emergency management: mitigation,
preparedness, response, and recovery. The Colorado Hazard and
Incident Response and Recovery Plan identifies the roles, responsibilities, and actions of Colorado state agencies and others during
35
and after disasters. Operational priorities for incident management include life safety, health of the public, environmental
36
protection, and recovery, among others.

Colorado food producers, processing plants, and distribution and
retail facilities are regulated and inspected by local, state, and
federal agencies to ensure the safety of food entering the supply
chain. Systems are in place to inform consumers of food recalls
and monitor and respond to foodborne illnesses. Colorado investigates outbreaks of foodborne illness and enteric disease through
interviews, medical records, site visits, testing of people, food or the

3.5 PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECTS OF
EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS

22



3.5.2 HEAT-RELATED ILLNESS
Colorado’s climate has warmed substantially over the past 30
37
years, and extreme heat events—defined as weather that is much
hotter than average for a particular time and place—are already
occurring and expected to become more common, more severe,
38
and longer-lasting as our climate changes. While even a small
increase in the number of extreme heat events can cause or
contribute to heat stress illness and death, the heat index in
Colorado is mitigated by relatively low humidity and mortality
due to extreme heat is limited. However, an average of 32 people
are hospitalized and about 250 Coloradans seek emergency
39
department care each year for heat-related illness.
Extreme heat events are the leading cause of death from all
weather-related hazards, and certain vulnerable populations are
at increased risk, including children, pregnant women, older adults,
and those with existing chronic conditions such as respiratory,
40
cardiovascular, and kidney-related diseases. Equity issues exist
for individuals who do not have access to air conditioning for
employment, mobility, income, or other reasons. Temperatures are
generally amplified in urban areas, and disruptions to electricity
and water supplies are known to exacerbate heat-related health
problems. Finally, these illnesses and deaths are largely preventable through preparedness and adaptation strategies. For these
reasons, CDPHE continues to monitor deaths, hospitalizations,
and emergency room visits due to heat events, and such data are
reported on the National Environmental Public Health Tracking
41
Network.

3.6 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS
Colorado has extensive programs in place to mitigate public health
risks and adapt to a changing environment. Approaches to further
promote climate resilience within the public-health sector are
listed below.

v Evaluate and adopt additional ozone control measures as
needed to attain federal standards.

v Continue to monitor and evaluate air quality, including
ozone and particulate matter concentrations, and issue
public health advisories as appropriate.

v Continue to assess potential correlations between climate
change, vector-borne diseases, heat-related illness and
harmful algal blooms. Incorporate the results into public
health guidance and communicate any revised risk reduction
measures to local governments and the public.

v The CDPHE, the Rocky Mountain poison center, and local

public health agencies will continue to investigate and
respond to illnesses reported to be associated with toxic algae.

v The CDPHE and local public health agencies will continue

to investigate individual cases and outbreaks of enteric and
foodborne pathogens, implementing surge capacity plans
as necessary.

v Emphasize climate-related disaster preparedness in
emergency response plans and exercises.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions

C

olorado is warming, and is projected to continue warming in the future. The decisions the State makes
today will inﬂuence the scope and extent of future climate change. By choosing to mitigate the
impacts of anthropogenic climate change and reduce Colorado’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions,
we will not only reduce the effects of climate change but also beneﬁt from cleaner air, better health,
and a stronger economy.
In the past, federal standards on appliance eﬃciency, vehicle mileage, power plant emissions, and other climate
programs have helped to address emissions at the national level. However these programs and regulations are
currently under review and their future is uncertain, making it more important than ever to develop a statespeciﬁc plan. This chapter lays out Colorado solutions and local actions that our citizens, businesses, and government agencies can take to reduce emissions. We cannot solve this problem entirely by ourselves, but if we tackle
our own emissions and work collaboratively through partnerships like the United States Climate Alliance, we
can still avoid the most harmful impacts of a warming climate.
Colorado joined the U.S. Climate Alliance in July of 2017, because we feel that together we are more equipped to
address this complex challenge and reduce emissions. The Climate Alliance is a coalition of states committed to
reducing GHG emissions consistent with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. Colorado will actively participate
on a number of subcommittees to address issues relevant to our state as well as share tools, data, and information with other member states. While this coalition is young, is it already proving to be incredibly effective.

While the challenge of reducing emissions is great, we are proving that we do not have to choose between a
1
healthy economy and emission reductions. From 2011 to 2014 Colorado “cleantech” industries grew—more
2
than 22 percent, greater than the national average—and now supports more than 66,000 jobs across the entire
3
state. We rank ﬁrst in the nation for wind manufacturing and in the top three for wind-related employment.
Over a 15-year period from 2000 to 2014, the United States’ gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew while CO2
4
emissions decreased. During the same time frame, state GDP in Colorado grew 27.5 percent while Colorado’s
carbon intensity (CO2 emissions per unit of GDP) fell by 15.7 percent and CO2 emissions per person fell by 13.1
5
percent. Global energy-related CO2 emissions were ﬂat in 2014 and 2015, while global GDP grew more than
6
3 percent per year. While these market trends can result in some adverse localized impacts or disruptions as our
energy economy transitions, the state is committed to assisting those communities through programs like the
Rural Response, Recovery, and Resilience program (“4R”) described in Chapter 10. Through collaboration and
innovation, cleaner energy and clean technologies go hand in hand with overall economic growth.
26



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

By acknowledging national and global trends and transition to
cleaner energy, Colorado will be better positioned to seize opportunities for our energy producing state. Those who take action
and seize the opportunity to develop new industries and new
jobs will reap both the environmental and economic beneﬁts.

4.1 GREENHOUSE GAS
REDUCTION GOALS
Governor Hickenlooper set four GHG reduction goals in July 2017
when he signed Executive Order D 2017-015, “Supporting
Colorado’s Clean Energy Transition:”

v Reduce GHG emissions statewide by more than 26 percent
by 2025, as compared to 2005 levels;

v A 25 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the electricity
sector by 2025, as compared to 2012 levels;

v A 35 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from the electricity
sector by 2030, as compared to 2012 levels; and

v Achieve electricity savings of 2 percent of total electricity sales
per year by 2020 through cost-effective energy eﬃciency.
These goals reﬂect both the policies that Colorado has already
implemented to reduce GHG emissions as well as the desire and
need to work towards more ambitious economy-wide reductions.
The state's ongoing efforts with the utility sector have put Colorado
in a good position to meet the electricity sector CO2 goals. Figure
4.1 shows the actual and estimated future CO2 emissions from
fossil fuel electric generating units statewide. From 2012 through
2017, power plant CO2 emissions have decreased approximately
12 percent and are projected to decline even more by 2035 based
on planned and proposed changes to the electric generating
ﬂeet. Assuming these anticipated changes proceed as planned,
Colorado will remain on track to meet or exceed its electricity
sector CO2 goals for both 2025 and 2030.

Figure 4-1

Colorado CO2 Emissions from Electricity Sector
Figure 4.1 depicts actual CO2 emissions from Colorado’s
fossil fuel–ﬁred electric utility generating units between
2012 and 2017, using data from the EPA’s Air Markets
Division and Energy Information Administration.7 The
decrease in emissions between 2012 and 2017is due in
part to the retirement of certain electric generating
units, including the Clark Generating Station, Arapahoe
Units 3 and 4, Cherokee Unit 3, Valmont Unit 5, and
Martin Drake Unit 5; the change in operation of Cherokee
Unit 4 to burn natural gas instead of coal; and the growth
in wind, solar, and other renewable generation. The
estimates of 2025 and 2030 emissions reﬂect the
planned or proposed retirements of Craig Unit 1, Nucla
Generating Station, and Comanche Units1 and 2. Craig
Unit 1 may be replaced with natural gas generation,
which would affect this projection, and the retirement
of Comanche Units 1 and 2 is still awaiting approval
by the Public Utilities Commission. The estimates also
include the addition of renewable and natural gas generation based on utilities’ public statements, electric
resource plans, and energy eﬃciency projections. The
range of the estimates for 2025 and 2030 is due to uncertainty regarding future electric demand, the portfolio
of generation assets, the potential retirement or degradation of renewable energy resources, the utilization of
electric generating units, and energy eﬃciency savings.

27



While we have made signiﬁcant progress, there is still much work
ahead that will require signiﬁcant collaboration and the innovative
thinking that Coloradans are known for. Meeting the statewide
goal of reducing total GHGs emission over 26 percent by 2025
will be much more challenging. State agencies are working to
develop strategies to achieve this goal and look forward to working with stakeholders to reﬁne and implement the progressive
GHG reduction strategies needed to meet this goal. As powergeneration emissions decline and transportation emissions continue to grow, the state must also ﬁnd new ways to move people
and goods across our vast and diverse landscape.

initiatives. Most notably, the 2014 inventory misses the recent
announcements that certain power plants would retire or switch
to natural gas, and that Colorado utilities would signiﬁcantly
expand their renewable generation portfolios. The 2014 inventory
projects that CO2 emissions from electric generating units would
10
drop just 5 percent between 2010 and 2030, but data and proposed changes to the electric generating ﬂeet indicate a much
larger reduction.

4.2 MEASURING AND PROTECTING
GHG EMISSIONS

The State of Colorado is taking many steps to reduce GHG emissions, as are many local governments, private businesses, utilities,
nonproﬁts, and individuals across the state. Federal efforts continue to result in GHG reductions as well, but are increasingly
uncertain. Several GHG reduction measures affecting Colorado’s
largest sources of GHG emissions are described below.

Measuring Colorado’s progress toward its climate goals requires
the state to estimate both past and future GHG emissions in an
emissions inventory. Doing so is a signiﬁcant undertaking in its
own right. Colorado published its most recent GHG inventory in
8
2014, based on 2010 data, with projections for 2020 and 2030.
9
While the next inventory is not due to be released until 2019, the
state is evaluating the available data sources, consulting with the
United States Climate Alliance on inventory methods, and determining the best process and a more frequent schedule for reporting GHG emissions. CDPHE is preparing to propose a state
regulation that mirrors the current federal GHG reporting requirements. More frequent and reliable data collection would enable
the state to have a better understanding of where our emissions
are coming from and how to develop strategies to reduce them.
The 2014 inventory relied on an EPA tool known as the State
Inventory Tool, and while the 2014 inventory remains the best
available data, it does not reﬂect all of Colorado’s GHG reduction

4.3 SECTOR-SPECIFIC GHG
REDUCTION INITIATIVES

4.3.1 ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS
Electric generating units (“EGUs”) are one of the largest GHG
sources in Colorado. The state began adopting policies to reduce
their GHG emissions as early as 2004 and has periodically updated
those policies (See Chapter 5). EGUs must comply with the state’s
renewable energy standard, demand side management (energy
eﬃciency) programs, and the 2010 Clean Air – Clean Jobs Act. In
2012 alone, these programs avoided more than 5.5 million tons of
CO2 emissions, nearly 14 percent of the 2010 CO2 emissions from
11
Colorado EGUs. These programs simultaneously achieved
major reductions of conventional pollutants, such as particulate
12
matter, ozone, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

In addition to complying with these mandates, Colorado’s utilities
are responding to global market forces and reshaping their electric
generation ﬂeets by shifting power generation toward cleaner
burning and renewable units. Table 4.1 identiﬁes signiﬁcant
changes since 2015 that have reduced power plant GHG emissions.
Contemporaneously with these changes to fossil fuel EGUs, renewable generation is growing quickly in Colorado. In response to the

industrial equipment, and other devices that burn fossil fuels.

State and local governments in Colorado are working to promote
multimodal forms of transportation, including light rail, transit
buses, ride sharing and bicycles. The state’s High-Performance
Transportation Enterprise (“HPTE”) was formed to aggressively
pursue innovative means of ﬁnancing important surface transportation infrastructure projects that will allow more eﬃcient
movement of people, goods, and information throughout the
state. Among other things, the HPTE has resulted in a 45 percent
increase in bus ridership on U.S. 36 between 2011 and 2016. Operating the I-70 Mountain Express Lane has increased General
Purpose lane throughput by 15 percent, with 18 percent faster
travel times. Colorado also beneﬁts from federal fuel eﬃciency
and emission standards for motor vehicles, and it has encouraged
the federal government to retain more ambitious standards set
during the previous administration.

State and local government agencies are reducing emissions
through building codes and energy eﬃciency measures. The
Colorado Energy Oﬃce provides training and resources to help
local jurisdictions adopt and implement newer building codes. Also,
the Energy Performance Contracting Program has completed
nearly 200 projects, resulting in the ﬁnancing of more than $500
million in energy and water-related capital improvement projects.
Energy performance has been improved at public school and
university buildings, veterans’ facilities, libraries, parks, community
centers, wastewater treatment plants, prisons, and other government buildings.

The state will continue to work to support the efforts of local
communities who wish to improve and strengthen their local
efforts to increase energy eﬃciency of buildings and decrease
emissions. The most cost-effective way to ensure the long-term

MANAGEMENT

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

From a sector-based approach, GHG emissions associated with
solid waste and methane generation by landﬁlls is often viewed
as a small component of the total GHG emissions produced by
industry. However, when analyzing GHG emissions associated
with particular services in the U.S. economy from a systems-based
perspective, GHG emissions associated with the provision of
goods and food account for an estimated 42 percent of total U.S.
GHG emissions, more than passenger transport emissions and
more than building HVAC and lighting emissions. Looking at GHG
emissions through a lifecycle analysis perspective and a systemsbased approach shows us that materials management plays a
signiﬁcant role in reducing GHG emissions.

Figure 4-2
Sustainable Material Management’s Life-cycle Perspective

.4.4.1 LANDFILL DIVERSION
Diverting materials from landﬁlls through recycling and composting are important components of SMM and result in a reduction
of overall GHG emissions. Maximizing the recycled content in
products results in a signiﬁcant reduction of GHG emissions and
energy consumption by offsetting the need for mining, material
extraction, material transport and processing of virgin raw materials.
Since 2007, Colorado has tracked GHG emission reductions resulting from the amount and types of materials that are recycled and
composted each year. In 2016,1.8 million metric tons of CO2 emissions were avoided through recycling and composting efforts in
Colorado. This is equivalent to the annual emissions from power23
ing 93,000 Colorado homes.
Currently, Colorado’s waste diversion rate of19 percent is below the
national average of 34.6 percent municipal solid waste that is re24
cycled and composted. Increasing the amount of waste diverted
in Colorado by recycling and composting plays an important role
in reducing GHG emissions. In August 2017, the Colorado Solid and
Hazardous Waste Commission approved statewide waste diversion
goals aiming to increase the amount of waste diverted over
the next 20 years. The new goals challenge Colorado to meet the
national average by 2026 and to match the current diversion rate
of the best-performing states, around 45 percent, by 2036.
While focusing on increasing waste diversion is important, the
state recognizes the need to use a lifecycle approach to accurately
measure and address GHG emissions. Conducting additional lifecycle assessments and improving sustainable materials management
for speciﬁc products such as food, packaging and building materials
can have major beneﬁts in reducing GHG emissions in Colorado.

4.5 LOCAL GOVERNMENT TARGETS
AND INITIATIVES

4.6 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS

As described in Chapter 10, many local government entities and
coalitions across Colorado are taking signiﬁcant action to reduce
GHG emissions. For example, the Pueblo City Council approved a
resolution in February 2017 that established a goal of operating
on 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. The City of Aspen
Electric Utility announced in September 2015 that it had signed
contracts to purchase all of its electricity from renewable sources.
In December 2015, the City and County of Denver updated its
Climate Action Plan to include a goal of reducing GHGs by 80 percent. Many cities, towns, and counties promote emission reductions,
sustainability and energy eﬃciency. In May of 2017, The Compact
of Colorado Communities was established to bring cities and
counties together in taking constructive and practical climate
action. The Compact’s mission is to advance capacity of Colorado
cities and counties to develop and implement aggressive climate
change initiatives thus ensuring security and economic prosperity.
The Compact will accelerate capacity building, alignment of
important resources and interests, and drive critical public engage25
ment on climate change action. Other local governments have
joined Colorado Communities for Climate Action to advocate for
GHG reduction policies. This is only a sample of the actions local
governments are taking to mitigate GHG emissions. More initiatives are described in Chapter 10, and momentum continues to
build. Governor Hickenlooper’s Executive Order directs state
agencies to consult and collaborate with local governments to
26
support locally led climate goals and resilience solutions. The
Colorado Communities Symposium in early 2018 provides an
opportunity for local elected oﬃcials and community and business
leaders from throughout Colorado to come together with state
agency leaders and staff to participate in visioning workshops to
collaboratively chart a path forward on how work together to
advance climate preparedness and clean energy development
in Colorado.

Colorado’s GHG goals are ambitious. Achieving our goals will
require sustained effort, and Coloradans must work together to
determine how to achieve smart emission reductions. State
agencies will fulﬁll the directives of Governor Hickenlooper’s
executive order. Policies that state agencies will pursue include:

v Working with electric utilities or cooperatives on a voluntary
basis to maximize the use of renewable resources while
maintaining reliability without increasing costs.

v Implement a statewide Electric Vehicle Plan to build out key
charging corridors that aligns with the environmental
mitigation trust from the Volkswagen settlement.

v Propose a state greenhouse reporting rule by December 30,
2018 that mirrors current federal requirements.

v Prepare annual updates to Colorado’s GHG inventory as
needed to track progress toward Colorado’s climate goals.

v Identify opportunities to partner with local governments to
support locally led climate goals and resilience solutions.

v Formalize and expand upon cross-agency efforts to provide
economic development strategies and other supportive
services to communities impacted by a changing energy
landscape.

v Evaluate the potential costs and beneﬁts of adopting
California’s motor vehicle standards.

v Consult with stakeholders and our state partners in the
United States Climate Alliance to identify and implement
future GHG reduction strategies for meeting statewide
emission goals.

This data set includes reported emissions and electric generation from coal-fired boilers and natural gas combined cycle units. The data set excludes CO 2 emissions from other forms of electric generation,
such as biomass, most small boilers, and diesel engines or simple cycle gas turbines used as “peaking” units, but the electric generation from these sources is considered in meeting the elect ric generation
forecast for 2025 and 2030. Colorado estimated future emissions using a simplified model that incorporates projections of future demand growth from utilities’ published electric resource plans. It is assumed
that future demand growth will be met with in-state generation. The use of different modeling tools or assumptions would result in different projections, and actual emissions are likely to vary.

nergy fundamentally helps to shape Colorado: from powering homes and businesses to the transportation
of people and goods, it touches nearly every aspect of life. It is also a major economic driver in the state.
1
In 2016, Colorado’s energy industry employed 274,760 people. Colorado’s real gross domestic product
(“GDP”) for its energy cluster was $25.6 billion in 2014, which was 9 percent of the state’s GDP for that
2
year. In 2017, Colorado had 66,223 clean-energy jobs, where at least some portion of time is spent on renewable energy generation, energy eﬃciency, advanced grid, advanced transportation, or clean fuels. This ﬁeld of
3
employment is growing rapidly throughout the state, and helping to contribute to our energy future. In addition, the cost of renewable energy resources is becoming increasingly competitive. Between 2010 and 2015,
the average price of wind fell more than 56 percent, while the average price of solar over that same period fell
4
74 percent. Energy also affects both the air and the water on which we rely.
Through bipartisan legislation, responsible regulation, and groundbreaking programs, Colorado is working to
promote innovative energy production and eﬃcient energy consumption practices that beneﬁt the economic
5
and environmental health of the state and help meet Executive Order D 2017-015. This chapter describes
Colorado’s electricity generation from fossil fuel and renewable resources, electricity demand and energy
eﬃciency efforts, the water-energy nexus, transportation, and the efforts to reduce GHG emissions from energy
production, currently underway in Colorado. Recommendations for strategies and policies to continue addressing climate change within the energy sector and to help achieve Executive Order D 2017-015 also are provided.
Colorado’s diverse portfolio of economically competitive energy resources for electricity generation includes
both traditional resources, and a wide range of renewable energy resources. This diversity stems from the
state’s multitude of programs, policies, and ﬁnancial incentives, including one of the most ambitious renewable energy standards in the nation. These initiatives are reducing GHG emissions from the power sector and
are helping Colorado become a leader in clean energy.

5.1.1 RENEWABLE ENERGY
In 2004, Colorado passed the ﬁrst voter-led renewable energy
standard (“RES”) in the nation, requiring electricity providers to
obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable
energy sources. The legislature has increased the amount of renewable energy required several times since 2004. House Bill 10-1001
required investor-owned utilities to generate 30 percent of their
electricity from renewable energy by 2020, of which 3 percent
6
must come from distributed energy resources. Cooperative
utilities are required to generate 20 percent of their electricity
7
from renewable sources. The RES has sparked the development
of hundreds of new renewable energy projects across the state,
generating thousands of jobs and helping to reduce the state's
GHG emissions. Resource Rich Colorado estimates that cleantech energy jobs in Colorado have grown 22 percent in the past
8
ﬁve years. Plus, Xcel Energy estimates that it has achieved a 34
percent carbon emissions reduction in its Colorado service terri9
tory since 2005. Should the Public Utilities Commission approve
its pending Colorado Energy Plan, Xcel Energy believes renewable energy could make up 55 percent of its energy mix by 2026,
10
reducing carbon emissions by 60 percent from 2005 levels.

37

Source: Xcel Energy. Energy and Carbon Emissions Reporting, 2016 Summary

From the Eastern Plains to the mountainous West, Colorado has
signiﬁcant wind and solar resources throughout the state. Spurred
in part by state policies and incentives, Colorado has one of the
strongest renewable energy industries in the country, ranking
11
eleventh in the nation in 2016 for total solar capacity and tenth
12
for installed wind generation capacity, with approximately 3900
13
megawatts (“MW”) of combined capacity. Currently, Colorado’s
14
installed capacity of solar photovoltaic is 940 MW. The ongoing
development of this resource is supported by tax credits and utility rebates that encourage homeowners and business owners to
install solar panels on their homes and businesses.
In addition, the installation of renewable energy in rural Colorado
is providing stable and predictable revenue streams to producers
15
who are dealing with low commodity prices; while large-scale
wind farms in eastern Colorado are projected to result in an
16
increase of $7.2 million to the local tax base.



Colorado also is exploring opportunities for small-scale hydroelectric power, geothermal power, energy from biomass, and
other innovative, renewable energy resources. Among these
innovative technologies, small hydroelectric power has been the
most widely adopted, there are about 60 small hydroelectric
17
generators in Colorado’s mountainous western region. The state
is working to encourage further development of small-scale hydropower and hydro-mechanical projects through the Regional
Conservation Partnership Program (“RCPP”), which is made up of
the Colorado Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service-Colorado,
Rural Development-Colorado, the Colorado Energy Oﬃce (“CEO”),
and nine other partners. This team initiated the Hydropower Partnership Project, which facilitates the development of low-impact
small hydropower on new and existing pressurized irrigation
systems, making it easy for agricultural producers to use hydro18
power in their irrigation operations. The CEO has also been
promoting small hydropower through holding Pressure Reducing
Valve Workshops throughout the state to educate water providers
on the hydropower opportunities on their existing conduit infrastructure. From December 2016 to June 2017, these workshops

facilitated in the submission of 11 Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) applications totaling nearly 650 kilowatts of
19
new small hydropower projects.
Colorado is home to world-class geothermal resources, which
currently are used directly for pools, spas, greenhouse agriculture,
aquaculture, space heating, and district-wide heating. According
to the Geothermal Resource Council, Colorado’s geothermal
potential is estimated to be as much as 8900 gigawatt hours, or
20
17 percent of the state’s current energy demand.
Since 2004 when Colorado’s RES was passed into law by voters,
Colorado has increased the amount of renewable energy in the
state (Figure 5-3) from 0.54 percent of total annual electricity
22
generated to 21.8 percent in 2016.

5.2 ELECTRICITY DEMAND
Climate change will have a variety of physical impacts on both
Colorado’s energy supply and demand. In particular, climate
change has the potential to alter future electricity demands
through long-term shifts and short-term perturbations. Energy

eﬃciency will play a major role in helping to address any surge in
electricity demand. Continued investment in energy eﬃciency
programs will help the state prepare for any major effects and
shifts. Colorado’s energy eﬃciency market has been an integral
part of driving economic growth and bringing environmental
beneﬁts to the state. Through a variety of policy initiatives, programs,
and ﬁnancial incentives in the commercial, residential, agricultural,
and industrial sectors, the state has proven energy eﬃciency
investments are cost effective and drive down energy demand.

5.2.1 ENERGY REDUCTION/EFFICIENCY
In 2007, the Colorado Legislature passed House Bill 07-1037,
requiring investor-owned gas and electric utilities to develop
demand-side management (“DSM”) programs to encourage energy
eﬃciency. House Bill 07-1037 set goals for the reduction of electricity sales and electric-peak demand by 5 percent of the 2006
level by 2018; in 2017 this was extended through House Bill17-1227,
requiring the Public Utilities Commission to set goals of at least
5 percent peak demand reduction and 5 percent energy savings
by 2028 as compared to 2018 levels. To meet these goals, utilities
offer DSM programs that provide rebates to customers for the
installation of energy eﬃciency measures in their homes or businesses. Since the programs began in 2009, Colorado’s investorowned gas and electric utilities have reduced electricity sales by
2,481,298 megawatt-hours (“MWh”) and electricity demand by
23
564 MW.
In addition to the DSM programs required by state statute, several
Colorado’s cooperative and municipal utilities have voluntary DSM
programs. These energy eﬃciency policies and programs are
driving energy savings and GHG emissions reductions throughout Colorado.
As of 2016, residential customers consumed 36 percent of the
24
total energy in Colorado, therefore the greatest opportunity for

the state to conserve energy is increasing the eﬃciency of homes
and buildings. By supporting the proper installation of just a few
key technologies related to space and water heating, the state
helps Colorado residents realize many beneﬁts, including a 20- to
30-percent cost reduction on their monthly utility bill, improved
indoor air quality, enhanced comfort and health, and increased
property value. The speciﬁc programs and initiatives driving this
effort are detailed below.

v The Residential Energy Eﬃciency Program through the CEO
focuses on increasing awareness and offering tools for
Colorado residents to reduce energy bills and consumption.
Offering a suite of incentives, programs, and technical
assistance, the residential program includes support for both
newly constructed and existing homes:

v Green Real Estate Initiative: More commonly known as
the “Green MLS” (multiple listing system), this statewide
initiative is designed to include energy eﬃciency and
renewable energy upgrades into the searchable ﬁelds in
the MLS that real estate agents use to help homebuyers
search for homes.

v Energy Codes: The most cost-effective way to ensure the
long-term eﬃciency of a home is to implement the most
up-to-date building energy code that increases the
minimum threshold for basic eﬃciency. The CEO and the
Department of Local Affairs (“DOLA”) have played key
roles in code adoption by offering training to local code
oﬃcials, contractors, designers, plan reviewers, and
architects, ensuring that local jurisdictions have the
capacity to review the new code and a workforce that
can design and build according to the adopted code.
The CEO and the DOLA also have developed an online
toolkit to provide Colorado counties and municipalities

Energy Conservation Code (“IECC”). As of 2017, 95 percent
of construction activity occurs in communities that have
adopted the 2009 IECC or greater, and 67 percent of
activity occurs in communities that have adopted the
2012/2015 IECC or greater (2012 and 2015 IECC are
essentially the same level of eﬃciency).

Committed to ensuring that energy eﬃciency services are available statewide, the Colorado Agricultural Energy Eﬃciency (“AgEE”)
Program was launched in 2014 to help make energy eﬃciency
more accessible for agricultural producers, often in rural areas.
Working with a broad group of government, industry, and utility
partners, the project is designed to address the barriers that prevent producers from investing in energy eﬃciency. By bringing

While coal and natural gas are the primary fuel sources for electricity generation in Colorado, accounting for 55 percent and 23
31
percent in 2016, respectively, each requires different amounts of
water for their processes. Renewable energy generation can have
some consumptive water use, depending on the technology, but
overall renewable energy resources require substantially less water
to operate than fossil fuel generation. In fact, solar requires no
water and has helped Colorado save more than 300 million gallons
32
of water between 2007 and 2013. Colorado’s Renewable Energy
Standard not only required utilities to generate a portion of their
electricity from renewable sources, but also indicated that the
33
measure would “minimize water use for electricity generation.”
41

To reduce the energy intensity of water use, water utilities in
Colorado are implementing water conservation measures at the
end-user level. An example of this is Denver Water’s Eﬃciency
Plan, which includes rebates for water-eﬃcient appliances and
incentive contracts for indoor water-saving projects to help offset
38
the cost of installing or upgrading equipment. The state also
offers programs such as the Water Eﬃciency Grant Fund to help
communities develop water eﬃciency plans and Energy Performance Contracting and Energy Savings for Schools which address
both energy and water usage.

T

ransportation systems are designed to withstand local historical weather and climate conditions and
to last 50 years or longer. Therefore, it is important to understand how future climate might affect these
investments in the coming decades. In Colorado, winter precipitation events are expected to increase
in frequency and magnitude, while in other seasons conditions that lead to droughts and wildﬁre
1
are also projected to become more frequent. To date, A comprehensive analysis of the speciﬁc impacts of climate change on Colorado’s transportation system has not yet been performed; however, a recent study on the
vulnerability of climate change in Colorado determined that there are two primary sensitivities in Colorado’s
transportation sector:
1 The sensitivity of road, rail, and airport infrastructure to the physical effects of extreme heat and heavy
precipitation; and,
2 The sensitivity of travel behavior and safety to impaired visibility and traction from wildﬁres and
2
precipitation events.
The transportation system aids Colorado’s economy through employment opportunities and freight movement, in
addition to providing vital infrastructure for other state sectors, including tourism and recreation. While transportation is a critical element of Colorado’s economy and warmer future temperatures can threaten the sustainability
and resilience of infrastructure, as a sector, transportation is also a signiﬁcant contributor of greenhouse gas
(“GHG”) emissions (Figure 5-1). In 2016, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector exceeded
3
those from the electric power sector for the ﬁrst time since the late 1970’s. Nearly 97 percent of transportation
GHG emissions came through direct combustion of fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas, propane, methane,
and kerosene), with the remainder due to carbon dioxide (CO2) from electricity (for rail) and hydroﬂuorocarbons
4
(“HFCs”) emitted from vehicle air conditioners and refrigerated transport. To minimize transportation impacts to
climate change, steps must be taken to decrease GHG emissions, while proactively mitigating and adapting for
likely impacts.

vehicles since 2010.

6.1 LAND-BASED TRANSPORTATION
Climate change poses an increased risk to delays, disruptions,
damage, and failures across our land-based transportation systems.
Those designing, sustaining, and building transportation systems
must incorporate mitigation and adaptation strategies to prepare
for the future. Climate change will likely impact roadways and railways through higher temperatures, more frequent and intense
heat waves and drought, ﬂooding, increased winter precipitation,
6
and more severe storms (Table 6-1). Given the long life span of
transportation assets, planning for system preservation and safe
operation under current and future conditions constitutes respon7
sible risk management. The challenge is proactively planning for
these changes in a cost-effective and feasible manner.

6.1.1 Roadways and BRidges
Colorado has more than 88,740 roadway miles and 8682 highway
8
bridges to maintain. The annual vehicle miles traveled (“VMT”)
on our state highway system is now more than 27 billion miles—
an increase of 57 percent since 1990. During the same time, our
road capacity (or new lane miles) increased by only two percent.
Projections show that VMT is expected to grow by another 47
9
percent by 2040. This increase in VMT presents a challenge to
reduce overall transportation emissions, despite the increasing fuel
eﬃciency of vehicles because of improved technology and more
stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE") standards.
Increasing traﬃc volume may lead to greater congestion and
increased emissions associated with operational ineﬃciencies.
As the climate warms, it may become more costly to build and
maintain roads and highways. Larger temperature variations
resulting in drastic freeze and thaw cycles are extremely damaging
12
to roadways, causing buckling and heaving of pavement and
increased instance of rock fall in the mountains. Increased precipitation intensity is associated with reductions in traﬃc safety,
decreases in traﬃc eﬃciency (such as speed and roadway capacity),
13
and increases in traﬃc accidents. These climate changes can
shorten the life expectancy of highways and roads by requiring
increased maintenance and repair, which results in vehicle congestion, as well as limiting access to businesses and properties.

6.1.2 Railways
Fourteen privately owned freight railroads operate in Colorado and own more than 2800 miles of track in the state. Approximately
14
one-third of total freight tonnage moved in Colorado travels by rail.
Climate change–related effects (Table 6-2) may disrupt, halt, or reroute railway traﬃc, which can have substantial impact on the
mobility of people and freight operations, in turn causing a negative economic effect. Derailments have the potential to threaten the
health and safety of Colorado communities. More frequent and severe heat waves may require track repairs, speed restrictions, and
shorter trains to avoid derailments. Damage from wildﬁres, ﬂooding, or debris ﬂows could disrupt freight and railway operations and
18
require railway lines and infrastructure to be rebuilt or raised in future expansion projects. As the climate warms, it could become
more costly to build and maintain railways and associated infrastructure, including tunnels and bridges.

6.2 AIR TRANSPORTATION
19

The Colorado Airport System includes a total of 74 public-use airports, 14 of which support commercial airline service. With more
than 58 million passengers traveling through annually, Denver International Airport is the largest of Colorado’s airports, the sixth
20
busiest airport in the United States, and the eighteenth-busiest airport in the world. Colorado’s aviation system and the activity it
supports is a signiﬁcant economic engine for the state, generating $36.7 billion of economic impact, and supporting more than
21
265,000 jobs with an annual payroll of $12.6 billion. As such, climate effects on Colorado’s air transportation system (Table 6-3) can
have substantial economic ramiﬁcations.
Impacts from climate change may affect aircraft and airports, which can affect air travel, infrastructure, and the economy. High temperatures, particularly at high altitude airports, may result in aircraft-payload (passengers, cargo, fuel, baggage, etc. ) restrictions, ﬂight
delays, and cancellations. Reduced payloads, and cancelled or delayed ﬂights have negative economic impacts for aircraft operators.

Colorado is home to approximately 5.5 million people and 3 mil26
lion jobs. By 2040, the population is expected to increase by 38
percent to nearly 7.8 million, with the number of people age 65
and older representing approximately 1.5 million or 23.8 percent
27
of the total. Because of these projections, Colorado is facing a
growing demand for mobility and services throughout the state.
This presents several opportunities to modernize our transportation systems and decrease emissions, while also meeting growing
demands for alternative transportation. This includes:

v Support electric vehicle deployment as well as the
associated electric vehicle charging station (EVSE)
infrastructure development. As more renewable energy
comes online, the air quality beneﬁts from the use of
electric vehicles will also increase.

v Using advanced engine management systems (e.g. startstop technology, engine heaters, truck stop electriﬁcation).
Adopting alternative fuel vehicles save money, reduce
emissions, reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and
strengthen the local economy.

v Promote more fuel-eﬃcient vehicles in line with advancing
CAFE standards.

v Transportation infrastructure that uses traﬃc management,
including Intelligent Transportation Systems, to minimize
traﬃc congestion.

v Consumer information including campaigns for eco-driving
and the use of alternative modes and transportation fuels.

v Develop and implement multimodal transportation
solutions that promote the increased use of pedestrians,
bikes, car-pooling, van-pooling, walking, and rapid transit.

v Tax incentives for low carbon products/processes.

52

v New cars will become cleaner as federal GHG and corporate

trucks will be able to platoon on highways. Recent studies
have estimated a 9% fuel savings for trucks that platoon,
decreasing GHG emissions.
Additional efforts are included in the Adaptation section below.

6.3.1 idle Reduction
Colorado Revised Statute (C.R.S.) 42-4-1206, more commonly
known as the “puffer” law, allows law enforcement oﬃcers across
the state to immediately ticket individuals who have left a vehicle
running unattended for any period of time, unless the car has a
30
remote starter system and adequate security measures. In addition, some local jurisdictions have adopted anti-idling ordinances
that limit idling of all motor vehicles operating in their community.
In 2011, the Colorado trucking industry joined with local governments and clean air advocates in Colorado to create a set of
31
recommendations for a statewide idling standard: C.R.S 42-14-101.
Commercial diesel vehicles that weigh 14,000 pounds or more
and are designed to operate on highways are limited to idling ﬁve
minutes within a sixty-minute period unless the vehicle activity
or circumstance is exempt under the statute. This consistent
guideline enables commercial drivers to comply with the law and
protect Colorado’s air quality across the state, rather than having
to follow a diverse patchwork of local regulations.



Transportation: A Health Equity and
Environmental Justice Perspective
Transportation planning decisions affect communities and individuals and can elevate or harm
people's health and quality of life. The Colorado
Department of Transportation’s (“CDOT”) transportation investments help determine how Coloradans
move throughout the state. These investment decisions ultimately help or hinder healthy behaviors,
such as doctor visits, job access, and access to the
many recreational opportunities Colorado offers.
This is especially true for underserved residents,
children, older adults, and households without
automobiles. CDOT recognizes that the right
transportation investments can support healthier
communities.
To this end, CDOT is committed to exploring the
linkage between health, quality of life, and transportation investments in the 2045 Statewide
Transportation Plan (to be adopted in 2020). This
analysis will begin with researching initial ‘best
practices’ used by other state Departments of
Transportation such as using Health Impacts
Assessments in a statewide context and implementing assessment findings. These actions will help
CDOT to continue to improve transportation
decision-making in our state.

6.3.2 Multi-Modal tRansit
developMent
Transit services are an essential piece of the state’s future transportation network, addressing the mobility needs of an increasing and
aging population, as well as contributing to the economic, social,
and environmental health of the state as it grows. National level
data show signiﬁcant GHG emission reductions by use of public
transportation. The environmental beneﬁts of transit vary based
on the number of passengers per vehicle, the eﬃciency of the
bus or train, and the type of fuel used. Yet, even a partially occupied
diesel bus emits far fewer GHG emissions per passenger mile
32
than a single occupant vehicle.
Consequently, the state of Colorado is taking many steps to
develop transit around the state. The CDOT Division of Transit and
Rail developed its ﬁrst ever Statewide Transit Plan in March 2015
to address future needs and guide the CDOT’s future transit
investments and actions. Transit needs and recommendations
33
were developed based on local, state, and federal input.
In 2015, the CDOT implemented Bustang, a new interregional bus
service, that offers express transit services to the communities of
Fort Collins, Loveland, Denver, Lakewood, Monument, Colorado
Springs, Frisco, Vail, Eagle and Glenwood Springs. Bustang connects
major populations, employment centers and local transit entities
while offering commuters more travel choices, alleviating congestion and consequently reducing emissions that contribute to GHG.
Between July 2015 and December 2017, Bustang carried more
than 350,000 passengers a total of 1.7 million miles statewide.
Senate Bill 09-108, codiﬁed as Colorado Revised Statute § 42-4508, is also known as the Funding Advancements for Surface
Transportation and Economic Recovery Act of 2009 (FASTER).
FASTER allows the State of Colorado to improve roadway safety,
repair deteriorating bridges, and support and expand transit.
The bill generates approximately $200 million yearly for state
transportation projects. FASTER supports transit projects with
$15 million yearly and provides state funds for transit. This has been
an important source of funds for maintaining existing local transit
systems and expanding regional and interregional bus services.
FASTER transit funds are split between local transit grants
($5 million per year) and statewide projects ($10 million per year).
Among the types of projects that have been awarded are the
purchase or replacement of transit vehicles and the construction
34
of multimodal stations (Figure 6-2). By funding and promoting
transit options, FASTER is assisting to reduce the number of vehicle

trips and reducing the growth of VMT, thus reducing vehicle
emissions. The state is also planning to dedicate at least $18 million
of the state’s forthcoming $68.7 million Volkswagen Settlement
allocation to supplement Federal Transit Administration (“FTA”)
and FASTER funding for transit vehicles and better incentivize the
broad adoption of alternative fuel vehicles by transit ﬂeets statewide,
thereby increasing the emission reduction beneﬁts of transit usage.
In addition to state efforts, many local entities are developing
transit in their communities. In the Denver metro area, the Regional
Transportation District (RTD) FasTracks Program is a multi-billion
dollar comprehensive transit expansion plan to build 122 miles of
new commuter rail and light rail, 18 miles of bus rapid transit, 57
new transit stations, 21,000 new parking spaces at light rail and
bus stations, and bus service for convenient bus/rail connections
across the eight county district. As of 2017, RTD has completed
50.9 miles of new commuter and light rail (the A, B, R, and W
Lines) and 18 miles of bus rapid transit (the US 36 Flatiron Flyer)
while constructing extensive new facilities at Denver Union Station
and new light rail and commuter rail maintenance facilities across
the metro area. Projects currently under construction include the
G Line, N Line, and extension of the southeast E,F, and R Lines.
The state also has dozens of rural transit agencies that address the
mobility needs of its residents, reduce GHG emissions, and reduce
congestion. For example, the Roaring Fork Transportation Authority,
which operates in several communities around Glenwood
Springs and Aspen, is the largest rural transit agency in the nation
35
and provides more than ﬁve million passenger trips every year.

6.3.3 coMpact and connected land

located near transportation hubs reduces vehicles miles traveled,
thereby reducing GHGs and, at the same time, promotes eﬃcient

Communities Symposium, included discussions on how the state
and local communities can work together to achieve their goals

6.3.4 alteRnative Fuels developMent
Colorado promotes the use of alternative fuels in the transportation
sector, like electric vehicles (“EVs") and compressed natural gas
(“CNG”), propane, and hydrogen vehicles. Alternative fuel vehicles
utilize local Colorado resources, diversify the state’s transportation
portfolio, and promote air quality beneﬁts by reducing consumption of gasoline and diesel.
Although alternative fuel vehicles represent a small share of
Colorado’s 5.8 million registered vehicles, the market shares are
growing rapidly, particularly for natural gas and EVs. As of 2016,
Colorado has more than 85,508 alternative fuel vehicles, including
biodiesel, ﬂex-fuel, hybrid, electric, natural gas, and propane vehicles.
From 2015 to 2016, CNG sales grew from 5.8 million to 8.2 million
gasoline gallon equivalents. EV sales have grown rapidly as well,
from 20 of the vehicles on Colorado roads in 2011 to 11,931 as of
39
October 2017.

ALT Fuels Colorado
Beginning in September 2014, the Colorado Energy Oﬃce (“CEO”)
and the Regional Air Quality Council (“RAQC”) developed the ALT
Fuels Colorado program to continue the advancement of the state’s
adoption of alternative fuels. The two organizations jointly operate
the ALT Fuels Colorado program with a $30 million budget funded
by federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement
Program funds in combination with local matching dollars. The CEO
manages half of the funding for publically accessible alternative
fueling stations, and the RAQC manages the other half for alternatively fueled vehicles.
The CEO manages $15 million to develop alternative-fueling stations
along major statewide transportation corridors with the goal of
developing an intrastate system for alternative-fuel vehicle travel.
Applications are accepted on an ongoing basis. To date, this program
has made awards for 10 publically accessible CNG fueling stations.
In 2018, the CEO will begin offering grants for publicly accessible
propane fueling stations and EV fast-charging stations along
Colorado’s transportation corridors.
The RAQC manages vehicle funding to cover the incremental cost
of CNG, CNG bi-fuel, electric, and propane-powered ﬂeet vehicle
purchases. Both public and private ﬂeets that operate within the
State’s ozone nonattainment and carbon monoxide maintenance
areas along the Front Range are eligible for this funding. Funding
levels range from $3000 to $35,000 depending on the size of the
vehicle and type of ﬂeet. Applications for this program are open
three times per year. To date, grants for 887 vehicles have been
awarded.



Charge Ahead Colorado
Charge Ahead Colorado is a program of the RAQC and the CEO
designed to improve Colorado’s air quality, reduce harmful air pollutants, encourage adoption of EVs and incentivize the widespread
distribution of EV charging stations. Under this program, charging
station grants cover up to 80 percent of an electric vehicle charging
station for Level 2 and DC fast-charging charging stations. Incentives
range from $3260 to $16,000 depending on the level of charger
purchased. Public and private entities (but not private home owners)
can apply for program funding.
The RAQC funding for the program is available in the seven–county
Denver metro area, while the CEO’s funding is available outside this
area statewide. In addition to charging station funding, the RAQC
also provides funding for electric vehicles in the seven–county Denver
metro area. Vehicle funding covers 80 percent of the incremental
cost of a qualiﬁed, Buy America compliant EV up to $8260. Only taxexempt organizations are eligible for vehicle funding due to the
$12,500 in state and federal tax credits available to taxpaying entities.
To date, the RAQC has awarded funding for 440 stations and116
electric vehicles, and the CEO has awarded funding for 173 stations.

charging stations. Station funds will be deployed through Charge
Ahead Colorado and ALT Fuels Colorado for community-based and
corridor fast-charging stations.
The investments made in alternative fuels infrastructure and vehicles
using Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program,
Volkswagen Settlement, and other funds will be guided in part by
research and modeling of electric vehicle charging station costs,
beneﬁts, and locations recently conducted by the RAQC in partnership with the City & County of Denver, National Renewable Energy
Laboratory, Southwest Energy Eﬃciency Project, the CEO, and the
CDOT. They will also be aligned with broader planning efforts such
as the alternative fuel priority corridors identiﬁed under the FAST
Act, Regional Electric Vehicle West, the Governor’s EV corridor agreement with seven neighboring states, and the Colorado Electric Vehicle
Plan. This plan, developed in support of the Executive Order, provides actions and strategies to build out Colorado’s fast-charging
corridors and ensures that the beneﬁts that come from widespread
EV adoption are achieved.

6.3.5 sMaRt MoBility
Much of today’s congestion on highways is due to traﬃc incidents
(like crashes), poor weather, poor traﬃc signal timing, work zones,
bottlenecks, and special events which all impact the ﬂow of traﬃc.
The CDOT has formed the Division of Transportation Systems
Management and Operations to address these different factors
causing congestion. See the ﬁgure below, which describes the
sources of congestion in urban areas:

vehicles with the goal of mitigating the negative impacts of excessive
nitrogen oxide emissions resulting from the affected Volkswagen
vehicles in Colorado. Colorado’s Volkswagen Beneﬁciary Mitigation

6.4.2 Resilience and asset planning
The historic September 2013 ﬂood affected areas of Colorado from
the Front Range foothills through the Eastern Plains, along the South
Platte River, and to the Nebraska border. The recovery from this
event included temporary and permanent repairs to transportation
infrastructure. The CDOT oversaw development of a methodology
and tool to assess risk and resiliency that quantiﬁes the cost-beneﬁt
ratios of resiliency alternatives for damaged roadways slated for
permanent repair. This methodology is used to evaluate the relative
risks and costs of damage severity and roadway criticality to determine the return on investments in accordance with Federal Highway
Administration Emergency Repair policies. Although this tool was
developed speciﬁcally for the ﬂood repair projects, some of the
concepts are being considered in the identiﬁcation, development,
or prioritization of other transportation project improvements, such
44
as the I-70 Risk and Resilience Pilot project. Speciﬁc challenges
identiﬁed during the ﬂood recovery efforts include deﬁciencies of
knowledge, tools and skills, funding, monitoring, and communication
in the design, construction, and management of resilient infrastruc45
ture assets, further detailed in the Colorado Resiliency Framework.
Stemming from the ﬂood recovery process, a year-long CDOT study
known as the I-70 Risk and Resilience Pilot process began in August
2016, and builds on the work completed in the wake of the 2013
ﬂood event. It is a data-driven approach to proactively identify and
address vulnerabilities of the transportation system from potential
physical threats, such as rock falls, ﬂooding, and landslides. Four
hundred and ﬁfty miles of I-70 from the Utah border in the west to
the Kansas border in the east have been analyzed for the potential
of future damage and closures due to physical threats. The Pilot
project identiﬁes assets at high risk and suggests cost effective
improvements that could be made now—in advance of a threat
occurring—to proactively harden the assets or apply other strategies
that reduce future risk. The CDOT plans to apply this process to other
key corridors around the state. Moving forward, it is recommended
that both the hazard assessments and the risk and resiliency analysis
be used in the planning and design of future transportation projects,
asset management, operations plans and maintenance practices.
Incorporating the lessons learned from the Pilot project into policies
and routine procedures can be a tool to address social, economic
and environmental stressors including natural disasters, population
growth and climate change.

Concurrently, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act
and Fixing America’s Surface Transportation ACT established requirements for states to develop and implement a risk-based asset
management plan. Colorado developed the ﬁrst version of the plan
in December 2013. The next version will incorporate high-level risk
management strategies and will further build upon the successes
in planning for risk and resilience. The CDOT will publish an initial
version of its new plan in late April 2018, and a complete version will
be published in summer 2019.

6.5 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS
There are several opportunities for Colorado to develop strategies
for addressing climate change as relates to the statewide transportation system. These strategies can be broadly categorized as
those that seek to reduce the emission of GHGs from the transportation sector and those that aim to prepare the transportation
system to deal with the effects of climate change that are
unavoidable.

6.5.1 stRategies to Reduce
ghg eMissions

v Continue to support strategies and develop new strategies
to reduce GHG emissions, reduce the growth of VMT and
alleviate congestion, as laid out in the Colorado Resiliency
46
47
Framework and the CDOT Air Quality Action Plan.

v Support new technology, ﬁber optics, and planning process
considerations to reduce GHG emissions by improving traﬃc
operations for improved safety, mobility and reliability.

v Provide guidance to local governments on land use planning
strategies to promote eﬃcient use of public resources and
reduce GHG emissions through compact, transit-oriented
development that utilizes smart growth practices and
complete streets.

v The CDOT’s Division of Aeronautics will continue to work with
the Federal Aviation Administration and local airport sponsors
to ensure airport infrastructure, facilities and equipment
minimize aviation’s impact on our climate, and are adaptable
to climate change effects, to the extent practicable.

57



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

● The CDOT’s Division of Transit and Rail will seek to improve
statewide transit connectivity by sponsoring and providing
grants for regional and interregional bus services. The Division
will monitor this goal by tracking the number of miles of
regional, interregional, and inter-city passenger service.
Increased transit opportunities can reduce single-occupant
vehicle travel and reduce GHG emissions.

● The CDOT’s Division of Transit and Rail will continue to support
local transit agencies by providing grants to rural and small
urban transit providers for operational costs and bus purchases.
The Division will track ridership in these areas with the goal
that transit ridership will increase by 1.5 percent every year.
Increased transit opportunities can reduce single-occupant
vehicle travel and reduce GHG emissions.

6.5.2 cliMate change adaptation

● Work to promote education of the traveling public on the
impacts of GHGs associated with transportation while
concurrently educating and training local, state, and federal
entities and their staff on climate change adaptation concepts
and strategies.

● Encourage local, state, and federal entities to assess climaterelated risks to transportation systems and take action to
48
improve their resilience.

● CDOT will continue the development of a process to assess
hazards, manage asset inventories, identify areas of high risk,
utilize those ﬁndings in the design and planning of projects,
and establishment of maintenance needs.
● Ensure a robust emergency management program to deal
with the immediate consequences of transportation
disruption.

● Improve communication, data sharing, and collaboration
between local, state, and federal entities related to climate
change mitigation and adaptation programs and activities for
transportation.

● Identify climate-related impacts and develop a standard
method of recording impacts and costs of climate-related
effects.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN



Agriculture

A

griculture is one of Colorado’s largest economic drivers, a $40-billion-dollar industry that provides a
1
safe, abundant food supply for Colorado, the United States, and the world. More than 35,000 farms
2
3
4
and ranches employ 170,000 people and operate on more than 52 million acres across the state.
5
Colorado’s dominant agricultural products include cattle and calves, wheat, and corn, but the state is
also known for the quality and wide variety of its livestock, fruit, and vegetable commodities, and it is the nation’s
largest producer of millet. The success of this industry is closely tied to the health of the land, where farmers and
ranchers have acted as stewards beginning from when Colorado was ﬁrst cultivated. A variable climate with
periods of severe drought has always been part of agriculture in Colorado, but a changing climate introduces new
challenges. With spring runoff projected to shift even earlier, streamﬂows projected to decrease, and heat waves,
drought, and wildﬁres all projected to increase in frequency and severity because of climate change, the Colorado
6
of the future is unlikely to look like that of the past. While this chapter focuses on adaptation, there are also many
opportunities for GHG reductions in the agricultural energy sector, those efforts are covered in detail in Chapter 5.

7.1 IRRIGATION
Irrigation is a critical piece of agricultural success in Colorado’s semi-arid environment. While some crops and
forage can grow on natural precipitation, many also require supplemental irrigation to maximize production.
7
Approximately 3.4 million acres of agricultural land are irrigated in Colorado, diverting 11 million acre-feet of
8
water. However, as temperatures increase, evapotranspiration increases, resulting in higher crop irrigation
9
requirements. This means it will take more water to grow the same crops.
The 2012 Colorado River Water Availability Study showed that crop irrigation requirements are projected to
10
increase by 8 to 29 percent by 2040 and 20 to 43 percent by 2070, depending on the climate scenario used.
Coupled with this, runoff is projected to shift 8 to 14 days earlier over the same time period. If a shift in growing
season does not coincide with the shift in runoff, the result may be that irrigation water is not available during
the time of year when the crop irrigation requirements are the greatest, thereby decreasing crop production or
increased demands for agricultural water storage opportunities. In some instances, irrigation requirements
may increase to such a degree that producers choose to grow fewer water-intensive crops. In other instances,
producers may feel that leasing their water rights for non-irrigation uses is more proﬁtable than growing a crop,
or they may choose to do a combination of the two. These adaptation decisions affect not only the farms and

62



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

producers, but also the landscapes and communities where these
farms are located. Fallowing land by choice or because of lack of
suﬃcient irrigation water can negatively affect the soil health,
public health, and ultimate survival of small rural communities in
many regions of the state.
As our climate warms, those agricultural users who have senior
water rights (giving them ﬁrst priority to water that is available in
a given year) may have more options available to them for adaptation than agricultural users with junior water rights (who have

access to their water only after all senior water rights have been
fulﬁlled). Additionally, as the climate of Colorado shifts, past records
of stream ﬂows become a less reliable guide for the future. In
some scenarios developed for the Interbasin Compact Committee,
projected ﬂows in 2050 are negative. Under those scenarios, some
existing uses, both senior and junior, would be unable to obtain
11
their historical supply of water (Figure 7-1). The Arkansas and
the Rio Grande Rivers have negative projected gauged ﬂows
under both Interbasin Compact Committee climate scenarios;

Figure 7-1
Projected Gauged Flows for 2050 (acre-feet/year)
Projected depleted flows for 2050 in acre-feet per year at 11 different sites around the state. “Hot and Dry” is defined as the 75th percentile of climate projections for crop irrigation requirement (water use), and the 25th percentile for natural flows. In other words, only 25 percent of projections have lower natural flows and 25 percent of projections have higher crop-irrigation
requirements. Between “twentieth century observed” and “Hot and Dry” is defined at the 50th percentile for both natural flows and crop irrigation requirements. This scenario is the middle
of the range of severity. Historical or current conditions, which is no change in runoff or crop irrigation requirement fall at roughly the 9th and 67th percentiles, respectively; this means that
91 percent of runs show increases in crop-irrigation requirement and approximately two-thirds show reductions in runoff.

63



the South Platte has a negative projected ﬂow under the “hot
and dry” climate scenario. In Figure 7-1, the more negative the
value, the greater the magnitude of the projected deﬁcit. Therefore the “hot and dry” scenario, which shows the greatest deﬁcit,
would likely result in the greatest impact to users. In all of these
cases both senior and junior water right holders would be affected by the presence of little to no water in the river. Additionally, the shift in timing of runoff may affect the water available for
users if their water rights are dependent upon a time period in
addition to volume.
These effects are not only seen on surface water ﬂows, but will
also impact groundwater return ﬂows, and well irrigation.
Continued monitoring, research, and planning are critical to
determining whether future supplies will meet future demands
and continue to fulﬁll existing demands. Addressing and adapting to these challenges will require collaboration and innovative
solutions.

7.2 PRODUCTION
Colorado has a thriving agricultural sector, but changes to the
climate—driven largely by increasing temperatures—can affect
both crop and livestock production. In some cases these effects
could increase production, as described below. In many other cases,
production is projected to be negatively affected. Understanding
where the agricultural industry is vulnerable to a changing climate
helps the state better prepare and adapt. Additionally, changes
to operations on farms and ranches may result in improved carbon
sequestration, helping to mitigate overall GHG emissions.
The Colorado Climate Change Vulnerability Study cites several
production-related vulnerabilities that exist under a warmer
12
climate. These include:

v Crop yields may decrease due to increased heat stress.

v Crop yields may be reduced due to increased severity of
droughts.

v The prevalence of weeds and pests may increase due to a
longer growing season.
v The prevalence of weeds may increase due to CO2 and
fertilization.

v Reduced or untimely precipitation may affect pasture
productivity and feed supplies.

While warmer temperatures resulting in a longer growing season
13
(ranging from 8 to 32 days in 2040 and 21 to 46 days in 2070)
could help to increase production in some areas of the state, a lack
of suﬃcient water and increased heat stress during that period
may negate any potential gains. Producers in cooler regions of
the state with adequate irrigation water are more likely to beneﬁt
from the longer growing season. Others are more likely to see
crop losses associated with increased heat stress and lack of suﬃcient moisture. Ensuring that ample water storage is available for
producers may help them adapt to warmer conditions and may
decrease losses because of lack of water availability. However,
studies also show that net evaporation (evaporation minus
precipitation) is projected to increase for reservoirs throughout
the West because of increased temperatures, and consideration
14
should be given to this expectation. Increased CO2 levels may
help some crops, such as wheat, produce a larger yield but may
15
also result in an increase in weeds. An increased occurrence of
weeds and pests may also affect production or require adoption
of more costly technologies that will better support crops during
a longer growing season.
Extreme weather, including both drought and ﬂood, can have
serious effects on the agricultural sector and production levels.
The Palmer Drought Severity Index already shows a trend towards
more severe soil-moisture droughts over the last 30 years, and
climate projections indicate that droughts, heat waves, and wildﬁres are likely to increase in frequency and severity by the middle
16
of this century. In 2012, it is estimated that lost revenues resulting from the extended drought in the agricultural sector alone
17
exceeded $409 million statewide. When secondary and tertiary
economic effects on local communities are factored in, the loss
18
increases to $726 million statewide. Not only do these events
affect production during the discrete event, but they can also
inhibit production for multiple growing seasons. For instance,
ranchers forced to cull herds in response to drought may need
several years for the native range to recover to sustain previous
stocking levels; headgates and diversion structures damaged by
ﬂoods will take time to be repaired or replaced; and wildﬁres may
degrade soil quality such that it may take some time before the
soil can support native species or grazing. Bare soils created by
the loss of native grass species due to extreme drought often are
ﬁlled by invasive noxious weed species and can take years to
recover in order to fulﬁll original livestock stocking rates. At the
same time, frost hazards are likely to decrease, which could bring
beneﬁts to some growers such as fruit orchards.

64



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

One adaptation strategy that may make sense for some producers
is to alter their crops to better ﬁt the changing climate. For example, if Denver warms 2oF, its climate would become more similar
to that of Pueblo’s today; if warming reaches 4oF, the Mile High
City would more closely resemble the climate of Lamar; and with
19
an increase of 6oF, Denver would be analogous to Albuquerque.
Crops that thrive in Pueblo, Lamar, and Albuquerque are different
from those that thrive along the northern Front Range today. This
shift may result in the cultivation of entirely different crops, or it
may mean planting new variations of existing crops that are better
suited for warmer and drier conditions. Adopting the cultivation
practices and requirements for new crops as well as entering
new marketplaces will not come without challenges and investments. What is also unclear is the extent to which new technologies and practices will help reduce the negative impacts of such
changes in temperature. However, researchers at Colorado State
University are already working to develop pioneering approaches
to tackle these issues, making Colorado a national leader in
20
agricultural innovation. Farmers and ranchers have traditionally
adapted very rapidly to weather changes due to the inherent
direct connection of their vocation to the land and the weather.
Also producers are rapid adopters of new technology increasing
the bushels of corn grown statewide from 10,640,000 bushel in
21
22
1917 to 134,900,000 bushel in 2015.

7.3 SOIL HEALTH AND CONSERVATION
Healthy soils provide nutrients to crops, hold water to nourish plants,
and ﬁlter pollutants. Consequently, soil health is an important
component of a producer’s ability to grow high quality products.
Yet climate change has the potential to negatively impact soil
quality. More severe and persistent droughts, wildﬁre, and severe
heat can degrade the quality of soils. Degraded soils require more
management, more added nutrients, and more water to support
a crop, which then increase management costs to producers.
Scientists have predicted that within the next 20 years, global
23
food demand will increase by 50 percent. Along with increasing
demands on energy and clean water, demands on the earth’s soil
24
resource to feed that population will be greater than ever. As
soil organic carbon has volatilized and diminished, the soil health
of the earth’s arable land has declined. Carbon-depleted soils
become less productive and more dependent on additional
inputs to produce crops.
Farming Colorado’s arid high plains requires maximizing soil
uptake of rainwater and melted snow for storage and crop use.
Reduced soil permeability results in reduced or prevented groundwater recharge and exacerbates the effects of limited precipitation
or prolonged drought periods. Furthermore, enhanced soil
permeability can decrease the extent to which precipitation runs



Food Access: A Health Equity and
Environmental Justice Perspective
Affordable healthy food options tend to be less
accessible in low-income neighborhoods and
while not the sole determinant of healthy eating,
25
access is an essential component. As the climate
warms and our food systems respond, food prices
may also fluctuate. From a health-equity and
environmental-justice perspective, this is likely to
have disproportionately negative effects on the
26
development and health of vulnerable populations.
Communities in Colorado and beyond are exploring innovative ways to improve access to healthy
foods and provide education that supports healthier
choices. Local nonprofits, schools, and community
groups are creating community gardens that not
only provide access to fresh produce, but also
empower individuals and families to learn how to
grow and cook their own healthy food. Community
garden initiatives such as Denver Urban Gardens
(DUG) and Groundwork Greens help meet the
needs of residents in Denver-area food deserts.
Additionally, Colorado Fresh Food Financing Fund
provides nearly $20 million in grants and loans to
investors who open grocery stores in designated
27
food deserts. Another innovative program, the
Double up Food Bucks Colorado, led by LiveWell
Colorado, enables residents on federal nutrition
benefits (SNAP or food stamps) to get free
fresh produce at participating farmers markets
28
and grocery stores. These are just some of the
creative solutions addressing food access issues
in Colorado.

7.4 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS
There are opportunities to develop strategies and incentives that
improve Colorado’s crop and rangeland resiliency as well as its
long-term sustainability and productivity.

v Promote increased water-storage solutions that help
producers adapt to changing conditions and decrease
production losses due to lack of water availability.

v Partner with research institutions and federal agencies to
support producers’ efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate
change through improved irrigation eﬃciency and
enhanced low tillage practices.

v Support federal and state programs that improve soil health,
such as by increasing soil organic carbon and sequestration,
promoting long-term research into land management
practices that build soil health, and examining state and local
land-use policies that reduce soil erosion on arable lands.

off the surface instead of inﬁltrating into the soil proﬁle. The
greatest challenge, and the most important need for improving
soil health, is in dryland settings. No-till farmers have achieved
substantial successes in dryland farming by leaving standing
residue from the previous crop to protect soils from sun and wind
and increase soil organic matter.
In 2017 a stakeholder engagement session held at the Governor’s
Agriculture Forum focused on agriculture and climate change.
The primary messages shared with the State at this session
included an emphasis on the importance of water storage for long
term climate adaptation and resilience, support for climate smart
agriculture strategies, and the high feasibility of soil health projects.

Tourism &Recreation

C

olorado is known around the globe for its majestic mountains and superior recreational opportunities,
including: 12 national parks and monuments, 42 state parks, 300 wildlife areas, 25 ski areas,14 gold-medal
ﬁsheries, 23 million acres of public land, and thousands of miles of hiking, biking, and running trails.
1
Annually, more than 82 million trips are taken to Colorado, resulting in $19.7 billion in consumer
spending, which in turn generates $1.3 billion in state and local tax revenues. Tourism supports 165,000 direct
2
jobs in the state, making it one of the state’s largest economic drivers. With 71 percent of all Colorado adults
participating in some form of outdoor recreation each year, residents of this state value recreation very highly.
Yet, all this is vulnerable to climate change and variability as many of these activities are dependent on climate.
At the same time, both tourism and outdoor recreation can also contribute to GHG emissions. Globally it is esti3
mated that 5 percent of carbon emissions can be attributed to tourism. Balancing a thriving tourism industry
with the challenges presented by a changing climate requires proactive and innovative thinking.
A signiﬁcant portion of Colorado's economy is reliant on tourism and in some locations tourism is the economic
engine of entire towns and cities. For these locations, climate change threatens not only physical ecosystem
health, but it also poses a threat to the long-term economic viability of the communities by affecting things
such as season length, infrastructure, and snowpack. For example, reduced snowpack or drought conditions
may lead to conditions that are ripe for wildﬁre. The presence or the even the perception of wildﬁre nearby,
can result in depressed tourism and recreation in a speciﬁc location or region. In communities dependent on
tourism and recreation, wildﬁre can deter visitors in both the short-term (due to safety concerns) and long-term
4
(because of accessibility or aesthetic issues). Alternatively, in some instances, Colorado's recreation dependent
towns may be well situated to cope with climate change. High-elevation ski resort towns may initially see an
overall economic beneﬁt because of their ability to remain relatively cooler than lower-elevation locations,
resulting in a competitive advantage over ski areas elsewhere in the country, despite the potential loss of
5
shoulder-season snow sports. Diversiﬁcation offers a strategy for these communities to mitigate the impacts
of climate change by providing a broader variety of recreational opportunities throughout the year that can
stabilize historical shoulder season and off-season revenues. Although climate change poses substantial
concerns for natural resource–based recreation and tourism communities, the adaptive capacity is high for the
6
recreation and tourism sector, positioning these towns to better address potential changes and challenges.

8.1 SUMMER RECREATION & TOURISM and wildlife-viewing experiences, a $3 billion industry. NeverIt has been said that people come to Colorado for the winter but
they stay because of the summer. Sunny days, moderate temperatures, and endless recreational opportunities offer great appeal.
However, the impacts of climate change are already affecting our
natural resources and the recreation sector, and these effects are
likely to continue into the future.
Over the past 50 years, statewide temperatures have increased
across all seasons, with the largest increases in the spring (3.4oF)
and summer (2.4oF); and over the last 30 years, summer has
7
warmed more than any other season. These increases—along
with lower snowpack and dust-on-snow—affect peak runoff,
shifting it by one to four weeks with larger shifts projected in the
8
future. Changes in peak runoff greatly inﬂuence the rafting
community, and a shorter faster runoff may shorten the overall
9
rafting season. For example, if the peak runoff—historically in
June and July—shifts by a few weeks or a month then the prime
rafting season would fall during the school year—before many
are taking summer vacations or are planning weekend trips.
Additionally, if streamﬂows in late summer decrease, veteran rafters
may perceive the experience as too mellow and choose to go
elsewhere. However, families with novice rafters may ﬁnd the
calmer waters very appealing. Outﬁtters and the Colorado Tourism
Oﬃce will need to be cognizant of messaging and marketing so
the right clientele is on the river at the proper time of year. This
industry has done a superior job of adapting their messaging during
time of drought—as in 2012—, which helped protect revenues.
Warmer temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns will also
affect summer recreation and tourism. In the majority of climate
10
models, summer precipitation decreases and temperatures
increase to such a degree that a typical year in 2050 will likely be
11
warmer than the warmest years we have experienced so far. The
result is more heat waves, drought, and wildﬁre—all of which can
inﬂuence visitors’ perception and deter tourism to Colorado. Aside
from the perception issues associated with wildﬁre, this natural
disaster may further negatively inﬂuence tourism through impacts
12
to air quality in addition to road, trail, and campground closures.
Warming temperatures, wildﬁres, and droughts can also force
wildlife out of their preferred habitat, potentially affecting hunting

71

theless, it is critical to keep in mind that Colorado is a large state
and wildﬁres tend to be very localized, this must be reinforced
in social media and marketing—there is still a lot of Colorado
to explore.

Changes to streamﬂow volumes and temperature also greatly
14
affect ﬁsh populations, especially cold-water ﬁsh such as trout.
Colorado residents alone log more than one million days of ﬁshing
activity. Non-residents log an additional nine million and spend
15
on average approximately $100 each day, which results in nearly
16
$2 billion in economic output. Temperature-induced habitat reduction can affect ﬁsh populations and consequently affect angling
experiences. Rising temperatures may also affect gold medal
status, which may also deter anglers from ﬁshing in Colorado.
Forest health may also affect summer tourism and recreation in
the state. Since 2000, warm and dry conditions have enabled bark
beetles to thrive, resulting in widespread tree mortality across 4
17
million acres of Colorado. While beetle infestation may inﬂuence
18
runoff and snowmelt, it can also affect visitor experience as
aesthetics may deter people from recreating through dead tree
stands. The same is true post-wildﬁre. In these situations, marketing other areas of the state that are less affected may be an
adequate adaptation strategy. The Colorado Resiliency Framework
addresses these issues and some strategies to tackle them post

disaster, including an open-for-business campaign. Nevertheless,
it is important that we work with our partners at the federal and
local levels to maximize resources, reduce local effects, and preserve community vitality following a disaster. Buffalo Creek Park is
a great example of an area that has remained extremely popular
20
with mountain bikers despite being located in a burn scar.

Snow-dependent recreation occurring at relatively lower elevations
is also likely to feel the effects of warmer temperatures. Activities
such as snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, ice climbing, and ice
ﬁshing all may face challenges because of warming temperatures,
decreased snowpack, and shifts in the timing of snowmelt and
runoff. Dust-on-snow events have already resulted in earlier
snowmelt. For instance, the Ouray Ice Park, an international ice

with the highest mean elevation nationally, Colorado is in a unique
position in that the majority of our resorts are located in the high

increases, these resorts are likely to maintain skiable terrain
through mid-century, even while other resorts around the nation
and world struggle. Initially, this may result in an increase in winter
recreation and tourism in Colorado. However, as temperatures
continue to warm beyond mid-century, more effects are likely to
surface, especially during the shoulder seasons.

8.3 MITIGATION
While approximately 5 percent of emissions on a global scale are
attributable to tourism, it is unclear what percentage of Colorado’s
29
emissions is a result of the tourism and recreation industry.
Globally there have been efforts to curb emissions within the sector,
and widespread adoption of these measures will likely beneﬁt
Colorado. Further expansion of public transit, such as the recent
restoration of the Winter Park Ski Train, could help reduce GHGs
as well as congestion, while still providing viable transit for
tourists and those seeking recreational opportunities, especially
along the Front Range. This is further discussed in Chapter 6.
For recreation, efforts are underway to reduce the greenhouse
gas emissions of resorts in Colorado. For example, Aspen Skiing
Company has committed to reducing CO2 emissions by 25 percent
by 2020, has invested $5.5 million to develop the ﬁrst large coal
mine methane-to-electricity project in the U.S., has built a 147kW
solar electricity system, and has supported numerous eﬃciency
projects within their operations. Most importantly, Aspen Skiing
Company will expand its political power, and that of its allies, to
30
support good policy at the state and federal level. Similarly, in
2017 Vail Resorts launched EpicPromise with the goal of eliminating
the environmental impact of its operations by 2030. This includes
zero net emissions, zero waste to landﬁll, and zero net operating
impact to forests and habitat. To reach these three goals, Vail
Resorts is partnering with nonproﬁt and community stakeholders
in Summit and Eagle counties on efforts to purchase 100 percent
renewable energy, increase and invest in educational programs
such as tree planting, recycling, and composting, and work with
31
local communities to increase options for reuse and diversion.

73

8.4 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS

v Partner with federal, regional and local agencies and entities
to preserve and protect forest health and wildlife habitat,
and to reduce wildﬁre risk.

v Examine National Park Service Climate preparedness
activities for possible collaboration.

v Frequently update a strategic marketing plan for the
tourism industry that addresses natural hazards and climate
change.

v Encourage diversiﬁcation of activities at recreational areas
statewide.

v Encourage broader business continuity planning to include
preparedness and post disaster strategies.

Ecosystems

E

cological systems support Colorado’s residents and key economic sectors, and the state is blessed with a
diversity of them. Eighteen dominant ecosystems, each made up of several land-cover types, serve as habitat
for plant, aquatic, and terrestrial species across the state. Healthy ecosystems support thriving communities
with clean air, clean water, plant pollination, wildlife diversity, and recreational opportunities. The ability of
ecosystems to continue to produce these services is challenged by effects associated with climate change.

Climate change may affect Colorado’s ecosystems in many ways, including by increasing the ability of insects and
invasive species to establish and spread, elevating the severity of wildﬁres, and altering habitats that support plant,
ﬁsh, and wildlife species. When intact, forested ecosystems function as a carbon sink, helping to offset emissions
of carbon dioxide (a major greenhouse gas) through the absorption and long-term storage of carbon in plant
1
tissues. In fact, U.S. forests offset almost 16 percent of the nation’s carbon dioxide emissions. Yet, these ecosystems
are also susceptible to ﬁre and disease. Effects of climate change such as drought and early snowmelt could lead
to forest die-offs from drought-related stress, decreased likelihood of tree regeneration after a ﬁre, and thus
2
decreased forest productivity.
Grassland ecosystems in Colorado will be particularly impacted by drought and changed precipitation patterns;
3
reduced plant growth will weaken the potential for these ecosystems to serve as CO2 sinks. Alpine ecosystems
are at risk of decreased growing seasons as temperatures warm, raising the levels of nitrogen and phosphorous,

Ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change and yet they also
offer opportunities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The
concept of “natural climate solutions” suggests that conservation,
restoration, and certain land management actions can increase
carbon storage in the form of land sinks and/or avoid greenhouse
gas emissions from activities that would otherwise occur on the
7
land. Scientists estimate that, globally, ecosystems absorb the
equivalent of approximately 20 percent of anthropogenic green8
house gas emissions. Natural carbon solutions, like reforestation,
improved forest management, and wetland conservation and
restoration, can also increase resilience to climate impacts. While
a promising approach, more research is needed to reﬁne methods
for implementing natural carbon solutions in the context of competing land uses, as well as estimates of the carbon beneﬁt from
9
implementation.
Any changes to ecosystems because of the effects of climate
change, or as an attempt to mitigate the effects, are likely to trigger
changes in current resource management strategies. In order for
state agencies to adequately manage natural resources, managers
must ﬁrst understand the potential for future impacts to ecosystems and resources, then tailor their practices to address
projected future climate changes.

9.1 FOREST HEALTH AND WILDFIRE
Wildﬁre is an essential element in the natural cycle for forests
worldwide. Critical ecosystem functions are served by a regular
cycle of ﬁre. For example, soils depend on nutrients replenished
through ﬁre, the temperature controls pests, and many tree
species rely on the extreme temperatures of wildﬁre for healthy
regeneration.

downstream. Strontia Springs Reservoir near Denver is one highproﬁle example of this pattern. Following the 1996 Buffalo Creek
Fire and the 2002 Hayman Fire, erodible soils poured into the
reservoir, choking the water supply with sediment. Denver Water
partnered with the U.S. Forest Service to drain the reservoir and
11
improve water quality, at a price tag of $33 million.
Those costs occur within the context of overall ﬁre suppression
costs. In addition to the more obvious costs associated with wildﬁre, such as damage to homes and assets of value, there is a range
of indirect costs as well. While the ﬁre is underway, businesses are
likely to lose customers, tourism will decrease, and those with
respiratory health problems may need medical attention. Longerterm rehabilitation of forests, roads, watersheds, and utility corridors
can also drive up costs. The 2002 Hayman Fire ultimately cost the
12
state $207 million, and at the time was considered one of the
most expensive ﬁres in the state’s history. The effect of the Hayman
Fire was rivaled by the Black Forest Fire in 2013 which devastated
over 14,000 acres; killing two people and destroying nearly 500
13
homes and more than 200 outbuildings. It is estimated that the
14
total cost exceeded $430 million.
Add to the increasingly severe ﬁres the steady development of
homes adjacent to ﬁre-prone public forested lands, and the
combination is a daunting management challenge. More than
2 million homes exist in Colorado’s wildland-urban interface (“WUI”)
– the 6.2 million-acre area where structures and other human
developments meet or intermingle with wildland vegetative fuels.
15
And this housing number continues to increase. Headwaters
Economics notes that 84 percent of private lands in the high-risk
16
zone are currently undeveloped. If the wildﬁre risk we currently
face in the WUI is only 16 percent of the scale of the problem to
come, more aggressive steps may need to be taken.

Several forest types, primarily low-elevation Ponderosa Pine, have
historically maintained a low tree density through frequent, low
intensity wildﬁre. When public land management agencies
adopted a policy of immediate ﬁre suppression, those historic
patterns were disrupted. No longer maintained by routine, relatively benign wildﬁres, forests became denser and accumulated
heavy fuel loads. Today, scientists agree that a century of aggressive ﬁre suppression, along with private land management
decisions, has contributed to unhealthy densities in many forest
types, and those forests are more vulnerable to unnaturally
10
intense and damaging wildﬁres. Indeed, excessively large and
intense wildﬁres can have a powerfully negative effect on the
ecosystem. Sterilized soils are much more susceptible to erosion,
and eroded hillsides feed sediment into rivers and reservoirs
00



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Figure 9-1
Wildland-Urban Interface Lands
in Colorado

Active forest management is a critical tool in restoring forest health,
reducing the risk of intense wildﬁres, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. An example of proactive management on a larger
scale can be seen in Denver Water’s longstanding partnerships with
the U.S. Forest Service and Colorado State Forest Service, which has
resulted in tens of thousands of targeted acres being treated to
reduce wildﬁre risk and protect critical watersheds. Activities in
high-priority areas include reduction of forest vegetation (i.e., forest
thinning), maintaining defensible space around utility infrastructures, and creating fuelbreaks along ﬁreﬁghter and resident ingress/
egress routes.
Yet a challenge to managing forests in the state is the fact that
Colorado has long struggled to maintain a forest-products industry.
By all accounts, the markets are weak and the economics of timber
harvest have been inverted; where once the U.S. Forest Service
earned money on contracted timber sales, it now expends money
on “service” contracts. With declining federal budgets, the agency
has fallen behind in clearing out the hazardous fuels that contribute
to extreme wildﬁres. Where perhaps one hundred years ago,
unbroken landscapes of healthy forests were common, we now

80

see overly dense, disease-infested, wildﬁre-prone ecosystems that
many scientists consider abnormal—and which are becoming increasingly vulnerable to large-scale bark beetle mortality as average
17
annual temperatures increase.
Overlaying the climate change context on this already challenging
situation adds complexity. As hotter, more damaging, more intense,
and more frequent wildﬁres have become the norm, scientists point
to the trend as indicative of a changing planet. It can be diﬃcult
to separate the many variables at play, but we know that ﬁre is a
participant in the dynamics of climate change. As temperatures
increase and snow melts earlier, wildﬁres begin earlier in the season
and have become more frequent. At the same time, those ﬁres
release CO2, contributing to the ongoing rise in global temperatures.
Research shows that these patterns are manifested in measurable
ways, with more large wildﬁres, signiﬁcantly more area burned,
18
longer ﬁre seasons, and longer durations for ﬁre events. More
detail on the state of Colorado’s forests and the risk of ﬁre and
insects is available in the 2016 Report on the Health of Colorado’s
19
Forests by the Colorado State Forest Service.



9.1.1 ADAPTATION
The most important piece of the forest-health and wildﬁre dilemma
is adaptation. The term “ﬁre-adapted communities” has gained
traction across the West as towns with acreage in the WUI have
learned that ﬁre is inevitable. The goal is not to eradicate ﬁre, but to
minimize the risk to assets of value. Many non-proﬁt organizations
address this through public outreach and grants to local governments. More than 150 communities in Colorado have been certiﬁed
“Firewise,” indicating their implementation of a suite of tactics
designed to remove local fuels and protect homes.
Similarly, 2017 legislation consolidated two existing grant programs
in Colorado to help private landowners who live in the WUI treat
their property to minimize risk. The Forest Restoration and Wildﬁre
Risk Mitigation Grant Program, administered by the Colorado State
Forest Service, is funded at up to $1 million a year through the
severance tax operational fund and accepts applications from across
the state. This new program, like its predecessors, requires applicants
to match the public funds they receive. Since 2009 these programs
have contributed almost $20 million in public dollars toward a
reduction in hazardous fuels in high-risk areas throughout the state.
But the demand for resources to address the forest treatment need
is still high.
The use of prescribed ﬁre is essential for the adaptation task. Only
ﬁre can accomplish the range of ecosystem beneﬁts the forest
needs. Mechanical fuel removal may succeed in reducing biomass,
but it fails to rejuvenate the complete system.

Federal land management agencies are essential partners in both
mitigation and adaptation efforts. Given Colorado’s mixed ownership landscape, the state cannot reduce ﬁre risk without a close
partnership. One helpful tool is the Good Neighbor Authority, which
allows state forestry agencies to conduct hazardous-fuels reduction
projects across ownership lines into adjacent federal land. Colorado
has successfully piloted this authority since 2000. Based in large
part on the successes in Colorado, the authority was legislatively
20
extended to all states in 2014.
Available funding is a limiting factor to mitigating risk. With a relatively small grant program funded by the State that is available to
help homeowners address this risk, there is room for improvement.
Many believe that homeowners who chose to build in the WUI
should bear the brunt of the costs for reducing the risk that can
threaten not only their homes, but also the State’s tax base. For this
reason, many fuels reduction efforts are targeted through public
outreach and education. These important efforts must be matched
with real resources, both in the form of funding for fuels-reduction
work and in technical support. Local, state, and federal agencies
must work in concert to provide these key resources, to incentivize
private landowners who have an immediate stake in their own safety,
and to leverage funding so that risk does not fall disproportionately
on those with insuﬃcient means. Additional funding, enhanced
partnerships, and better outreach would improve outcomes.
We can further mitigate risk by focusing on reducing the number of
new homes built in ﬁre-prone landscapes. Governor Hickenlooper
convened the Wildﬁre Insurance and Forest Health Task Force in



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

2013 to consider the role of private home insurance companies in
reducing wildﬁre risk, and the Task Force developed a series of
recommendations. Chief among the suggestions was the need for
better information about risk in the WUI. The Colorado Wildﬁre Risk
Assessment Portal is a web-mapping tool offering information for
homeowners, emergency responders, risk planners, realtors, and
insurance companies to understand the wildﬁre risk in an area and
21
possible actions that could mitigate that risk. The Portal is intended
not only to raise risk awareness, but also to help emphasize the need
for WUI homeowners and communities to take personal responsibility to mitigate that risk.

9.2 FISH AND WILDLIFE
Coloradans heavily value wildlife, natural places, and outdoor
22
recreation; and wildlife contributes to the state’s multi-billiondollar outdoor recreation economy. In 2012 alone, Colorado
residents and visitors spent more than $21 billion on outdoor
recreation trips and equipment, a large portion of which were
directly related to wildlife through activities like hunting, ﬁshing,
23
and birding. As the state’s wildlife agency, Colorado Parks and
Wildlife (“CPW”) is entrusted with the responsibility of perpetuating ﬁsh and wildlife resources and ensuring outdoor recreational
opportunities for current and future generations.
Eighteen dominant ecological systems comprise Colorado’s landscape and serve as habitat for the many hundreds of species
24
managed by CPW. Future projected climatic changes have the
potential to alter habitat and water supplies that support wildlife.
For decades, biologists and resource managers at CPW have
studied species and their habitat to manage for seasonal and
cyclical changes. Now wildlife managers must understand the
potential for future changes and adapt management practices to
maintain wildlife populations for ecosystem health and future
public enjoyment.

of habitat types as well as the resulting response of those habitat
types to the changed conditions. The state received and incorporated signiﬁcant public input into the plan. The ﬁnal SWAP was
submitted to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in September 2015
and was approved in March 2016.
To inform the climate portion of the SWAP revision, the State conducted a thorough analysis of the vulnerability of priority wildlife
habitat under an altered climate. The State, in collaboration with the
Colorado Natural Heritage Program, U.S. Geological Survey, and the
North Central Climate Science Center, studied projected exposure
to climate change, sensitivity of priority habitat types to expected
changes, and the adaptive capacity of these habitat types to respond
to changes. Ultimately, the study produced a vulnerability assess25
ment rating for thirteen priority habitats in Colorado. This effort
received a 2016 Climate Adaptation Leadership Award honorable
mention from the National Fish, Wildlife and Plant Climate Adaptation
Strategy’s Joint Implementation Work Group, in partnership with
the Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Natural
Resource Conservation Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, U.S. Forest Service, and the Association of Fish and
Wildlife Agencies.
The results of climate modeling out to 2050 indicate broadly that all
areas of the state are likely to experience some degree of warming.
Precipitation projections are more variable: some models project
drier than current conditions, and some project wetter. Even slightly
wetter conditions may not be suﬃcient to maintain soil moisture
conditions as experienced in the recent past when combined with
26
expected increases in temperature. Most wildlife habitat will not
shift quickly, but within the 30-year timeframe we will likely begin to
27
see altered ecosystem composition. By mid-century, future wildlife
28
habitat will likely be warmer, especially on the eastern plains.

Aquatic habitat was not directly considered in the SWAP vulnerability
assessment, but biologists have known for decades that aquatic
species in Colorado may be uniquely affected by climatic changes.
9.2.1 ADAPTATION
Increased temperatures and decreased precipitation pose a threat
In 2015 the state revised their State Wildlife Action Plan (“SWAP”),
to aquatic species because increased water temperatures and

conditions for climate factors believed to inﬂuence the distribution While the focus of the studies may be initiated for other purposes,
many also address issues related to potential climate change, such
30
as thermal tolerances of native aquatic species.

82



Past work conducted by CPW scientists has focused on evaluating
effects of ﬂuctuating water levels in reservoirs to help forecast the
31
effects of drought on ﬁsh populations. The State has been working
with scientists at Colorado State University and the U.S. Geological
Survey to evaluate the potential impact of climate change on highelevation cutthroat-trout waters and to model the persistence of
cutthroat trout populations given a variety of factors, including
32
variables associated with climate change. Other work cooperatively
conducted by state agencies and Colorado State University includes
a study of Eastern Plains ﬁshes to determine if populations will be at
risk because of increasing temperatures and changes in hydrological
patterns. Researchers have already begun to investigate whether
stream-habitat improvement efforts can help stabilize water temperatures in degraded areas.
Ongoing stream-habitat work includes an emphasis on ﬁsh passage
features to improve connectivity of habitats and allow ﬁsh to migrate
to avoid becoming stranded in areas of unsuitable habitat. CPW
continues to build upon past work to improve stream connectivity
to enhance climate adaptation for ﬁsh species. This includes working
with local municipalities and water users to install ﬁsh passage
structures where feasible. One notable example is a ﬁsh passage
structure installed by the City of Fort Collins at the Fossil Creek
Reservoir Diversion on the Cache la Poudre River in 2016, which
facilitates passage of all ﬁsh species at the location. Additional ﬁsh
passage projects are in planning and implementation stages across
the state.

9.3 STRATEGIES AND POLICY
RECOMMENDATIONS
There are opportunities to affect policy and to develop strategies
and incentives to increase the resiliency of Colorado’s ecosystems.
The following are possible approaches.

v Continue to support funding and technical support for
homeowners who live in areas with high risk of wildﬁre.
Focus efforts on mitigation and the reduction of hazardous
fuels around homes.

v Develop and improve incentives for homeowners to
encourage personal responsibility for risk reduction.
Combine incentives with robust outreach and education.

v Maintain current data in the Colorado Wildﬁre Risk
Assessment Portal, so that homeowners and others can
accurately assess the level of risk associated with their
communities, and to best inform insurance companies,
emergency personnel, and local governments.

v Encourage forest management on private, state and other
lands to help capture and store carbon, reduce wildﬁre and
insect/disease risk, improve wildlife habitat, and achieve
other forest management objectives. Recommended
management actions may include emphasizing tree diversity,
reducing woody fuel loads, helping forests regenerate after
ﬁre and other disturbance, and landscape-scale forest
restoration projects.

v Promote the utilization of Colorado wood products to
improve markets that enable forest management actions.

v Implement conservation targets and management actions
in the updated SWAP approved by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service.

v Update the SWAP, including climate-related elements, no
less frequently than every 10 years.

v Work with state, federal, and non-governmental partners to
model projected distribution of species, to the extent that
available data supports analyses.

v Coordinate among CPW, the Colorado Water Conservation
Board, the private sector, and municipalities to evaluate
how future water-supply projections will impact aquatic
habitat.

v Develop strategies to reduce impacts of climate change in
aquatic systems through stream-habitat improvement
and connectivity.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN



Partnerships

P

artnerships and collaboration play a central role in achieving this plan’s goal of improving Colorado’s
ability to adapt to and mitigate future climate change impacts, increasing Colorado’s preparedness, and
identifying opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (“GHG”) throughout the State of Colorado.
In accordance with Executive Order D 2017-015, the purpose of this chapter is to outline the importance
of meaningful consultation and collaboration with local governments, non-proﬁts, and the private sector to meet
the State’s goals for GHG reduction. Another purpose is to empower the implementation of locally led climate
adaptation and resilience solutions.
This chapter highlights examples of collaborative action already taking place throughout the state and identiﬁes
opportunities for future action. It is not an exhaustive list of everything every community or organization in
Colorado is doing about climate change. This chapter highlights opportunities for collaboration and innovation,
articulates the support the State can provide to communities, and acts as a guide to what has been successful
to date and what can potentially be successful for other communities around the state in the future.

10.1 CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE
In 2015, the State of Colorado developed the Colorado Resiliency Framework (“Framework”), the State’s roadmap
for resilience. While the Framework was catalyzed by recent disasters, including the record 2012-2013 wildﬁres and
2013 ﬂoods, it provides actionable steps to reduce vulnerability from shocks (acute events such as wildﬁres, ﬂoods,
and tornadoes), and stresses (underlying long-term conditions including a lack of affordable housing, poor forest
health, and constrained community ﬁnances). Evidence shows that climate change has the potential to magnify
vulnerability to both shocks and stresses across multiple sectors. The State of Colorado deﬁnes resiliency as:
The ability of communities to rebound, positively adapt to, or thrive amidst changing conditions or
challenges — including disasters and climate change — and maintain quality of life, healthy growth,
1
durable systems, and conservation of resources for present and future generations.

87



COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Communities who are resilient in the face of disasters and climate
change display the following key characteristics:

v They are aware of their risks and vulnerabilities, as well as
their strengths. This awareness serves as a lens to inform
planning, policy, and action.

v They are diverse in perspectives, relationships, culture, and
thinking. Diversity of perspectives drives innovation and
helps to enhance social capital, which can be one of a
community’s greatest assets when a disruption occurs.

v They are integrated. Recognizing that communities
increasingly rely on complex and interdependent systems,
infrastructure and government operations are able to
maintain operability even if one component in the overall
the system fails.

v They are self-regulating, meaning that they can bend without
breaking when under extreme stress.

v They are adaptive. They can anticipate challenges and make
necessary changes—sometimes small, and sometimes
large —to proactively reduce their vulnerability to acute or
2
persistent disruptions.
Climate adaptation, while distinct from resilience, is a synergistic
3
approach to addressing the impacts of climate change. Adaptation encompasses adjustments in natural or human systems as a
result of expected impacts from climate change. Adaptation
actions can be taken before impacts are observed in order to
anticipate changes to risk or vulnerability, or it can be taken after
the effects and consequences of climate change have already
been observed. Adaptation and resilience actions require collaboration across all levels of government, the private sector, and
other community institutions. As a partner in this effort, the State
of Colorado is committed to supporting communities in building
capacity and developing and implementing adaptation and
resilience solutions that meet local needs, priorities, capabilities,
and vulnerabilities.

10.2 STAKEHOLDER ROLES
During the development of the Resiliency Framework, the State
engaged with local governments, businesses, and citizens
through a series of surveys, interviews, and focus groups. During
the engagement process, the State asked 450 stakeholders, including local government oﬃcials, small businesses, climate scientists, leaders from community based organizations, and the
general public about their view about the roles and responsibili-

88

ties of state government, local government, and community institutions in making communities more resilient. Respondents indicated that the State plays an important role as an advisor and
educator, and shares a regulatory responsibility with local governments. Local governments play a key role as a facilitator and
share responsibility with community institutions, including businesses, as a service provider.
Through the Framework, this Climate Plan, and locally driven efforts, stakeholders have consistently pointed out that while the
State plays an important role in advising, developing tools, and
providing resources to empower action, that local communities
are in many cases best suited to directly confront the effects of
climate change in Colorado. Already local governments around
the state have adopted new renewable fuel sources to power
their communities, have committed to reducing GHG reduction
in accordance with or beyond targets of the Paris Climate Accord,
and have put forth innovative solutions for planning for and mitigating future changes.

10.2.1 STATE CLIMATE ASSISTANCE
The State of Colorado can provide assistance to support and
empower regional and locally driven climate adaptation and
resilience actions. As outlined in earlier chapters, the State has
implemented planning, policy, and regulatory actions to reduce
GHG emissions and adapt to changing conditions. In addition,
state agencies can provide a range of technical and ﬁnancial
assistance services and support local efforts to cultivate cross-

Table 10-1

sector and regional partnerships. The State recognizes that
addressing challenges associated with climate change requires
interdisciplinary coordination and action. The State seeks to make
its support to communities as streamlined as possible. Depending
on local needs, communities can work with any State agency to
tailor appropriate solutions. State agency representatives will be
able to coordinate with partners in other departments to expand
support as needed.

COLORADO CLIMATE PLAN

Below are a few examples of State resources and activities
to support climate adaptation and resilience.

10.2.1.1 Climate Planning Resources

v Planning for Hazards: Land Use Solutions for Colorado
In 2016 the Colorado Department of Local Affairs developed
this guide and website (www.planningforhazards.com) to
provide Colorado municipalities and counties with tools to
reduce risks to hazards, including guidance on developing
a local Climate Plan and Resilience Planning. Training and
technical assistance to municipalities and counties to
implement land use strategies to reduce risks are underway.

v Colorado Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal (CO-WRAP)
The Colorado State Forest Service created CO-WRAP
(www.coloradowildﬁrerisk.com) to provide public access to
information that describes wildland ﬁre risk statewide.

v Hazard Mitigation Planning
The Colorado Division of Homeland Security and Emergency
Management provides data, resources, and technical
assistance to support local hazard mitigation planning.
www.colorado.gov/paciﬁc/mars/mitigation

v Integrating Water into Land Use Planning
The Colorado Water Conservation Board, the Pace University
Land Use Law Center, and the Department of Local Affairs’
Community Development Oﬃce developed educational
water eﬃciency and conservation materials targeted to
Colorado water providers and local government planners,
including a series of webinars.
www.colorado.gov/paciﬁc/cowaterplan/integrating-waterland-use-planning

v Local Drought Planning
The Colorado Water Conservation Board offers ﬁnancial and
technical support to any local jurisdiction interested in
drought mitigation planning, including: guidelines for
developing a drought mitigation plan, a Drought Mitigation
Toolbox, and Drought Mitigation Planning Grants.
https://tinyurl.com/LocalDroughtPlanning

v Climate Change in Colorado
The Western Water Assessment (WWA) in partnership with
the Colorado Water Conservation Board, authored a report
on climate science relevant for management and planning
for Colorado’s water resources, focusing on climate trends,
climate modeling, and projections of temperature,
precipitation, snowpack, and streamﬂow.
https://tinyurl.com/ClimateChangeInCO

90

v CO-Resiliency Resource Center
The Colorado Resiliency and Recovery Oﬃce developed this
online platform (www.coresiliency.com) for resiliency
knowledge and technical resources to provide government
agencies, elected oﬃcials, community organizations, the
private sector, and individual resiliency champions with
knowledge and resources to Understand, Plan for, and Act
on resilience.

10.2.1.2 Colorado State Forest Service Nursery
The Colorado State Forest Service Nursery (the Nursery), located in
Fort Collins, is leading a unique effort to cultivate trees and plants
that are native to—and appropriate to—Colorado’s climate. The
nursery is one of ﬁve such state-managed facilities in the country.
At its 130-acre facility, the Nursery grows seedlings for more than
50 native Colorado species of plants and trees to assist private and
public landowners and land managers across the state with
4
conservation efforts. The seedlings can be used for a variety of
conservation efforts including reducing erosion risk and stabilizing
soil; improving wildlife habitat; reforesting areas impacted from
wildﬁres, ﬂoods, and pest infestations; sequestering carbon; and
5
using drought-tolerant species.
The Nursery staff take great efforts to ensure that the plants they
grow are best suited for Colorado’s ecoregions, and thereby have
the greatest positive ecological impacts. As conditions continue
to change and evolve, the Nursery will continue to play a key role
in ensuring that the right seed, in the right place, at the right time
is available in order to to preserve and improve our air, water, soil,
and wildlife habitats.

10.2.1.3 Rural Response, Recovery and
Resilience
During the 2017 legislative session, the State Legislature established the Rural Response, Recovery, and Resilience program (“4R”),
which is designed to support community driven efforts to adapt
mineral extraction-dependent economies in the face of a changing
economic landscape. Coordinated by the Colorado Department
of Local Affairs, the program will provide strategic technical and
ﬁnancial assistance to eight pilot counties over a ﬁve year period
designed to diversify the economy and build community resilience
in the face of shocks and economic stresses. Counties currently
eligible for this program include Delta, Montrose, Gunnison, Moffat,
Rio Blanco, Grand, Clear Creek, and Routt.



10.2.2 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

10.2.2.1 City of Fort Collins

All around the U.S., local communities are taking the initiative to
address climate change. In the spirit of Colorado’s strong localcontrol tradition, local governments in Colorado are particularly
well poised to tailor locally appropriate mitigation, adaptation,
and resilience solutions through plans, policies, regulations, investments, and partnerships. There are a number of national and
statewide initiatives that bring local governments together to
address the impacts of Climate Change. For example, mayors from
around the U.S. have formed the Mayors National Climate Action
Agenda, known as “Climate Mayors,” a peer-to-peer network of
communities committed to working together to adopt and
6
uphold the Paris Climate Accord. As of September 2017, 372
Mayors from around the country have committed to upholding
the Paris Goals. In Colorado, 16 municipalities have signed the
7
Climate Mayors Pledge.

Fort Collins, located on the Front Range north of Denver, is the
fourth largest city in Colorado and has a population of 161,000.
Fort Collins embraces conservation, active lifestyles, and innovative
solutions. To that end, the City Council in 2015 set aspirational
goals and updated its Climate Action Plan—a roadmap to achieve
those goals—to ensure the community’s long-term social, economic, and environmental health.

In the previous version of this climate plan, examples from several
communities around the state were provided to highlight the
progress being made in Colorado in implementing new ideas for
adapting to climate change, enhancing resilience or committing
to GHG emission reductions. Additional examples from around
the state have been included in this update.

When the goals were adopted in 2015, the City’s 2014 inventory
showed that emissions were 8 percent below 2005 levels. From
2015 to 2017, the City has increased investments in additional
energy eﬃciency, renewable energy, and overall infrastructure to
support the goals. These investments have paid off—the City’s 2016
Community Carbon Inventory showed a 12 percent reduction in
emissions—all while the population and local economy grew.
In addition to overall emission reductions, the community has
reaped signiﬁcant economic and social beneﬁts from these investments, including the following:
● Businesses are saving more than $9.5 million annually from
investments they've made in energy eﬃciency alone.

● The community has increased locally installed solar capacity
by almost 3.5 times from 2014 to 2016, which not only
supports cleaner air but helps to avoid future development
of additional electricity generation sources.
● 96 percent of Fort Collins residents recycle.

● Transit ridership rose 26 percent from 2015 to 2016.

10.2.2.2 Garfield County Communities
Communities in Garﬁeld County have worked together since 2009
to achieve regional targets for energy eﬃciency, renewable energy,
and petroleum independence, and to use this work to diversify
and strengthen the local economy. A Colorado Department of
Local Affairs (“DOLA”) New Energy Communities grant launched the
countywide effort. In 2012, recognizing the long-term economic
beneﬁts of clean energy, local government partners formed the
Garﬁeld Clean Energy Collaborative.
Garﬁeld Clean Energy (“GCE”) is a regional government collaborative
that provides programs and services to help households, businesses,
and local governments become more energy eﬃcient and reduce
energy costs. Garﬁeld Clean Energy members are Parachute, Riﬂe,
Silt, New Castle, Glenwood Springs, Carbondale, Garﬁeld County,
Colorado Mountain College, and the Roaring Fork Transportation
Authority. Services are delivered by a regional nonproﬁt, Clean
Energy Economy for the Region (“CLEER”).

Showcase projects include large solar arrays powering 100
percent of the electric needs for water treatment plants in Silt and
Battlement Mesa, and an array at Roaring Fork High School in
Carbondale, the county’s ﬁrst 100-percent-solar-powered school.
In Riﬂe, the city government has achieved net zero status, using a
portfolio of 15 arrays to generate 2.7 MW—at least as much electricity as it draws from the grid. The estimated annual value of this
solar energy tops half a million dollars, according to estimates from
10
Garﬁeld Clean Energy. With a population of 9400, the city is believed to have the highest per-capita solar production in the nation.
The countywide effort has also started a collaboration with neighboring counties to create a “Clean Energy Innovation Corridor,”
an effort that aims to reach clean energy targets in a three-county
region with local renewable energy—and do so in a way that
maximizes local job training and economic opportunity.

10.2.5 FEDERAL AGENCIES

10.2.6.1 Colorado’s Brewing Industry

Agencies across the federal government provide ongoing support
to the State of Colorado, local governments, businesses, and individuals to address the impacts of disasters, to address community
development needs, and to enhance long-term resilience. For
example, six federal departments support the state’s resilience
24
leadership team, the Colorado Resiliency Working Group. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency supports the development of hazard mitigation plans and projects, and it has been
working closely with state agencies to develop ways to address
resiliency and asset management. The U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development supports the development of affordable
housing that incorporates energy eﬃciency and weatherization.
The U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Interior help communities
and the agricultural and natural resources sectors to mitigate and
to recover from the effects of droughts, ﬁres, and ﬂoods, as well as
to manage forests, grasslands, and soil health. Additional federal
agencies support social, environmental, economic, and infrastructure related resilience priorities. The State will continue to work
closely with our federal partners to increase Colorado’s ability to
respond to the impacts of a changing climate.

Colorado’s brewing industry is not only one of the biggest and most
25
robust brewing industries in the country, it is a leader in putting
in place actions that mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate
change. In 2015, a handful of Colorado’s locally owned and operated
breweries signed the Climate Declaration, committing to a number
26
of actions to monitor and reduce their environmental impact.
One brewery who signed on to the declaration is Fort Collins-based
Odell Brewing Company, Colorado’s third largest craft brewery.
The Odell Brewing Company powers 95 percent of its operations
through wind generators and the other 5 percent through solar
panels. The company also recaptures steam to use for heat in its
27
brewing process. MillerCoors, with its largest brewery located in
Golden, has identiﬁed its own environmental sustainability strategy,
which includes a goal to reduce its per-barrel carbon footprint by
28
25 percent before 2020.

In early 2017, the Colorado Department of Public Health and
Environment (“CDPHE”) started the Sustainable Breweries Assistance
Initiative to provide breweries with on-site assessments to document
current eﬃciency metrics for energy, water, air, and waste usage.
The program offers pollution prevention techniques and steps for

10.2.6.2 District-Scale Collaboration
Colorado is taking action at a district-scale to plan, design, and implement collective strategies for urban sustainable development with
the objective to achieve ambitious performance outcomes for
resilience and climate protection. The Denver 2030 District is “an
interdisciplinary public-private-nonproﬁt collaborative working to
create a groundbreaking high performance building district in
29
downtown Denver.” The District brings together property owners,
managers, and developers with businesses, local governments, and
community stakeholders. Through collaboration, leveraged ﬁnancing,
and shared resources, the District benchmarks, develops, and
implements creative strategies, best practices, and veriﬁcation
methods for measuring progress towards a common goal: economic
prosperity and environmental sustainability. Participants also have
access to a “marketplace” that offers products and discounts to cover
HVAC systems, high performance windows, advanced metering,
LED lighting, EV chargers, and plug load management devices.
The district-wide goal is to reduce building energy use, water
consumption, and transportation GHG emissions in downtown
Denver—50 percent by 2030. The District’s energy goal is compared
to 2003 baseline data from the Department of Energy’s Commercial
30
Buildings Energy Consumption Survey. The District's water goal is
compared to a baseline average of Denver Water’s 2010 and 2011
water data. Lastly, the baseline data for the transportation goal was
developed with the Downtown Denver Partnership using the data
from the 2013 commuter survey to baseline future transportation
31
carbon reductions. As of 2016, the District has made signiﬁcant
progress by achieving a 34 percent reduction in building energy use,
and 11 percent reduction in water consumption.
Three communities in the cities of Denver, Boulder, and Fort Collins
are exploring the EcoDistrict model to develop neighborhood,
municipal campus, and district-scale solutions to achieve various
urban sustainability and climate goals. Visit the Incubator Projects +
Teams for more information about participating communities
in Colorado.

and Statewide Water Suppy Initiative
In 2015, the Colorado Water Conservation Board
(“CWCB”) released the state’s first comprehensive
water plan. Colorado’s Water Plan set forth priorities
for water use throughout the state as well as dynamic
strategies needed to meet Colorado’s future water
needs. The plan considers a range of possible future
conditions and develops a practical, adaptive, and
balanced path forward for meeting these needs
through stakeholder engagement and sound science.
Given the challenge that climate change presents in
32
predicting future water supplies (and demands),
Colorado’s Water Plan does more than prepare for
the most likely future: It incorporates the uncertainties posed by climate change by looking at a broad
spectrum of futures, each with different levels of
water supplies, water demands, and social values.
The plan identifies a portfolio of needed actions for
each possible future scenario as well as decision
points (or signposts) that allow future planners to
determine which scenario the state is headed for.33
The CWCB is currently updating the Statewide Water
Supply Initiative (“SWSI”), the state’s analysis of
water supply and demand, serving as the technical
foundation for Colorado’s Water Plan. This time,
the SWSI analysis uses hydrologic modeling to
quantify the scenario planning approach initiated in
Colorado’s Water Plan. The result will be a consistent
and scientifically sound statewide framework for
examining future water supply and demand under
different scenarios. The SWSI update will also serve
to provide a wealth of tools and data to help basin
roundtables update local basin implementation plans
by better targeting local solutions to identified gaps.
Taking into account the unpredictability of factors
driving Colorado’s future, the ability to plan for
multiple scenarios presents a much more comprehensive tool to plan and prepare for what lies ahead.

Moving Forward

11

I

n Colorado, climate change presents a broad range of challenges. Projections from climate data indicate
that the warmest summers from our past may become the average summers in our future. With increasing
temperatures, shifts in snowmelt runoff, water quality concerns, or extreme weather events that can impact
air quality, transportation and infrastructure, the challenges we face will affect everyone, and require
collaborative solutions.
Yet, by acknowledging potential impacts head on, assessing where we are most vulnerable, and by offering
meaningful actions now and across all sectors, Coloradans will be in a better position to mitigate, and adapt to, the
effects of climate change. Thankfully, Colorado is already leading the charge. Our commitment to a renewable
energy standard (“RES”) was the ﬁrst in the nation, as was our regulation of methane from oil and gas development. Colorado’s Water Plan provides innovative solutions to meet the water needs of all Coloradans long into
the future, and factors in how a changing climate may affect our supplies, demands, and ecosystems.
The strategies and recommendations laid out in the plan are commitments by state agencies to continue moving
us forward by providing policies and strategies to mitigate and adapt. Those strategies and recommendations
cover both long-term and short-term objectives that the state is actively working on. Some are new, while
others are ongoing. We are working across agencies and with the Governor’s oﬃce to prioritize actions for the
greatest beneﬁt to Colorado. We always welcome input and ideas from stakeholders. While the action items are
also included in each sector chapter, they are summarized on the following pages.

Transportation

v Continue to support strategies and develop new strategies to reduce GHG emissions, reduce the growth of VMT and alleviate
congestion, as laid out in the Colorado Resiliency Framework and the CDOT Air Quality Action Plan.

v Support new technology, ﬁber optics, and planning process considerations to reduce GHG emissions by improving traﬃc
operations for improved safety, mobility and reliability.
v Provide guidance to local governments on land use planning strategies to promote eﬃcient use of public resources and reduce
GHG emissions through compact, transit-oriented development that utilizes smart growth practices and complete streets.
v The CDOT’s Division of Aeronautics will continue to work with the Federal Aviation Administration and local airport sponsors to
ensure airport infrastructure, facilities and equipment minimize aviation’s impact on our climate, and are adaptable to climate
change effects, to the extent practicable.
v The CDOT’s Division of Transit and Rail will seek to improve statewide transit connectivity by sponsoring and providing grants
for regional and interregional bus services. The Division will monitor this goal by tracking the number of miles of regional,
interregional, and inter-city passenger service. Increased transit opportunities can reduce single-occupant vehicle travel and
reduce GHG emissions.
v The CDOT’s Division of Transit and Rail will continue to support local transit agencies by providing grants to rural and small urban
transit providers for operational costs and bus purchases. The Division will track ridership in these areas with the goal that transit
ridership will increase by 1.5 percent every year. Increased transit opportunities can reduce single-occupant vehicle travel and
reduce GHG emissions.
