The “Roadmap to 2020” Process
In 2010 the Oregon Global Warming Commission is undertaking a “Roadmap
to 2020” Project that will offer recommendations for how Oregon can meet its
2020 greenhouse gas reduction goal (“10% below 1990 levels”), get a head
start toward its 2050 goal (“at least 75% below 1990 levels”), and build a
prosperous, clean‐energy‐based 21st century state economy.
Commission recommendations will be addressed to the next Governor, the
Legislature, our Congressional delegation, local governments, businesses and
Oregonians generally.
The initial work of describing scenarios, sifting through possible
recommendations and evaluating them, has been done by six technical
committees drawn from business, academia, non‐governmental organizations,
local government and state agency staff.
Technical committee draft recommendations were presented to the
Commission on October 8. The Commission adopted the roadmap as an
interim document on October 28. This is the compilation of all of the
Roadmap elements adopted by the Commission at that meeting, including the
resolution adopting the Interim Roadmap (see next page).
These Interim Roadmap elements will be incorporated into the Commission’s
upcoming Report to the Legislature due in early 2011.
The Commission will invite broad public review of all recommendations in
early 2011 through a public process, and take comments into consideration in
a 2011 revision of the Roadmap.
By the end of 2011 the Commission is planning to finalize all aspects of the
Roadmap.

Resolution Adopting the Interim Roadmap
Resolution of the Oregon Global Warming Commission
Resolution Number: 2010-3-014
Origin: Angus Duncan, Commission Chair

Adoption of an Interim “Roadmap to 2020” Report
Whereas, the Oregon Global Warming Commission adopted Resolution # 2010-1-013
earlier this year which called for the development of a “Roadmap to 2020” to recommend
actions and strategies that may be used by the legislative and executive branches of
succeeding State governments, in partnership with Oregon communities, institutions,
businesses and citizens, to achieve the State’s 2020 emissions reduction goal, and,
Whereas six technical committees, composed of technical experts and stakeholders, were
convened in the summer of 2010 to develop draft Roadmap recommendations for
Commission consideration, and,
Whereas each of the technical committees (energy/utilities, industrial, forestry,
agricultural, materials/waste management, transportation/land use) submitted a report with
a list of potential actions to meet the 2020 reduction goals and a long-term vision of how
the sector might operate if it were to be in a position to meet the 2050 reduction goal, and,
Whereas each technical committee specifically identified a small number of key
recommended actions to be implemented to help meet the state’s 2020 reduction goal, and,
Whereas additional “integrating actions” which are not sector-specific but have
implications for most recommendations, emerged in the committee process and have been
brought forward at this meeting of the Oregon Global Warming Commission for inclusion
into the “Roadmap to 2020”, and,
Whereas the Oregon Global Warming Commission has discussed and, where appropriate,
modified the “Roadmap to 2020” report elements at this meeting of the Commission.
Now therefore be it resolved:
The Oregon Global Warming Commission adopts the “Roadmap to 2020” report elements
as modified at this meeting of the Commission to form an Interim Roadmap to 2020 report.
The report is labeled “interim” to acknowledge the desire of the Commission to further
refine the “Roadmap to 2020” over time by, (1) conducting a public comment process in
early 2011 on the Roadmap elements, (2) improving the quantitative basis for the Roadmap
with more in-depth analysis, and (3) revisiting the balance of actions among sectors as
additional quantitative analysis is done and with the benefit of viewing the Roadmap
holistically, in contrast to the sector-specific manner in which it was created. It is the
desire of the Commission to revise the Roadmap and create a new version, with the interim
label removed, by the end of 2011.



Integrating Commission “Roadmap to
2020” Recommendations
(not sector‐specific)

I.

Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goal for 2030

The Oregon Global Warming Commission shall recommend to the Legislature a 2030 Oregon
GHG reduction goal; thereafter and from time to time, but not less often than every ten years,
the Commission shall revisit and recommend as needed ten‐ and twenty‐year emissions
reduction goals, and monitor progress toward their achievement.
The Oregon Legislature adopted greenhouse gas reduction goals for 2010, 2020 and 2050,
following the recommendation of the Governor’s Advisory Group on Global Warming in 2004.
This gave the State near‐term, intermediate and ending targets. With 2010 behind us, the 2020
goal becomes the near‐term goal and the need for a new intermediate goal arises. This need is
reinforced by the need to coordinate with other planning entities and initiatives which are
already looking past 2020 (e.g., ODOT setting a State transportation GHG goal for 2035; NW
Planning Council 20 year power plans; utility Integrated Resource Plans, etc.).
II.

Greenhouse Gas Inventories

The Oregon Global Warming Commission, in collaboration with State agencies, local
governments and others, should develop greenhouse gas accounting methodologies and results
(a) by source, (b) by use/user, (c) by cost and timing of reduction choices, and (d) by county or
other state geopolitical division. The Commission should use this accounting framework to
allocate and sequence carbon reduction targets by cost, sector and geography, to enable
Oregonians to better understand how emissions reduction goals can best be achieved, and what
may be their share of the overall responsibility.
Oregon’s current greenhouse gas inventory approach is largely “top‐down,” calculating
emissions by sector, often from fuel use data or estimations. Electric utility emissions are an
exception, relying on reporting from facilities generating electricity allocated to Oregon loads
(“consumption‐based”). A greenhouse gas emissions reporting system is being established by
DEQ at legislative direction; and DEQ staff is working with stakeholders on modeling for a
consistently consumption‐based model. Finally, there is a need for data that can be
disaggregated (a) geographically, to allow local governments to understand their emissions
profiles by sector so they can design responses, and (b) by cost‐effectiveness and timing, so
Oregon can describe and pursue a least cost path to its emissions goals. The Commission
should be interacting with all parties to ensure that data are consistent and usable by
policymakers and managers.

III.
Advocating for a national carbon cap or other equally effective national carbon
reduction measure.
The Oregon Global Warming Commission reaffirms its support and advocacy for a national
carbon cap or other means to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions economy‐wide, as
previously asserted in Resolution 2009‐1‐009, and will communicate with the President and with
Oregon’s Congressional Delegation to this effect.
The Commission is already on the record in support of this kind of national action (“. . . the
Commission reaffirms its support for a fair and effective national solution to achieving
greenhouse gas reduction goals comparable to Oregon’s, one that employs marketplace tools
such as a cap and trade mechanism, as ultimately preferable to regional or state‐based
initiatives.”). The issue arose in several of the Roadmap Technical Subcommittees, but as it
transcended the writ of any one subcommittee, members asked that it be considered by the
Commission as a whole. As intra‐state initiatives move ahead, they are handicapped by the
absence of national policy that sets clear direction on greenhouse gas reduction goals and
timing, that encourages private sector initiatives and innovations, and that protects the
economic competitiveness of states, communities and businesses that are already reducing
emissions.
IV.

Energy and Infrastructure Research Funding Priority

The Oregon Global Warming Commission and the State of Oregon should advocate with
Oregon’s Congressional Delegation and the President to assign the highest priority for federal
research funding to energy and infrastructure opportunities that hold greatest promise for
delivering near‐term greenhouse gas reductions.
While much can be done to reduce emissions with existing technologies and applications, it is
clear that achieving reductions comparable to Oregon’s “greater than 75% below 1990 levels”
will require significant technological advances in fuels, power plants, vehicles, appliances,
lighting and other efficiency and fuel‐switching options. Challenges such as carbon
sequestration and assessing climate modification options remain beyond our reach as
potentially needed tools. Yet federal funding for energy research is barely $5 billion annually
(up from $3B in the last Administration, down from an inflation‐adjusted $7.7B in 1979; and far
below the budgets for health research [$30B] and defense [$80B]). Half or less of that budget
goes to renewables and efficiency. Meanwhile, major reinvestment in transportation, power
transmission, water and other infrastructure is needed to leverage technologies into
widespread use. The Commission would be asserting that there should be no higher priority
assigned to government research dollars than in finding ways to reduce emissions and
preparing for the effects of climate change that cannot be avoided, and leveraging private
sector investments toward the same outcomes.

Energy Roadmap to 2020
Report to the Oregon Global Warming Commission
The following report, Energy Roadmap to 2020, was developed by the Energy Technical Committee
of the Oregon Global Warming Commission (OGWC). Energy Committee members are listed in
Appendix B of this report.

I. PURPOSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of the Committee was to develop and prioritize a set of strategies and actions for to
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy production and use in order to meet Oregon’s
2020 greenhouse gas goal. The recommendations will be considered by the Oregon Global Warming
Commission for inclusion in the Interim Roadmap to 2020/Report to the new Governor and
Legislature, to state agencies, and to Oregon’s Congressional delegation. Recommendations may
also guide private sector investments and university research agendas.
After several months of deliberations the Committee narrowed the list of recommended actions
down to the following Key Actions. Appendix A contains the consolidated Inventory of Actions
developed by Energy Technical Committee. The Committee’s Key Actions are more fully described
in Section III – Key Actions For 2020. In summary they are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Develop State Energy and Climate Policy
Energy Efficiency
Support and Plan for New Transmission
Phase Out Emissions Associated with Coal Generation
Oregon University System (OUS) Energy Research Priorities
Modern Gas Infrastructure
Smart Grid and Integration of Resources

The Committee recognized that In all our state’s greenhouse gas reduction strategies, while Oregon
can be a leader, it cannot by itself materially affect the growth of greenhouse gas emissions without
reciprocal initiatives by other states, by our federal government, and by other countries across the
globe. Attempts to go our own way in isolation would be not only ineffective, but would have
adverse economic effects on Oregon households and businesses. Especially this is true in our
electricity and gas utility sectors, where we are interconnected, by physical ties, access to fuels, and
economics, to the rest of the country and the world. The recommendations that follow should be
read with this qualifier in mind.
At the same time, we also assert the importance of providing leadership in this sector as Oregon has
done so often in the past, from our transmission arrangement with our neighboring states and with

Canada, to our pioneering work in energy efficiency and least cost planning. Leadership provided
by Oregon and other states is not only essential to achieving essential greenhouse gas outcomes; it
also positions our state to capitalize on emerging national and global clean energy markets. The
recommendations must be read in this context as well.
We explicitly acknowledge the essential role that Least Cost/Integrated Resource Utility Planning
(IRP) has assumed in the planning and decision‐making processes of our state and region over the
last three decades. The setting and achieving of energy and climate policy goals for utilities is best
accomplished within this framework.

II. FUTURE STATEMENTS
We cannot predict in detail how energy and capacity will be produced, delivered and consumed in
2050, we can propose scenarios that, relying on existing and emerging technologies only, could
plausibly meet our aggregated goals of reliability, affordability, and low greenhouse gas and other
emissions. It is likely that the architecture and operations of such an evolved system will be as
different from today’s as today’s is from that of the mid‐20th century. We can expect it to be
reshaped by emerging technologies and evolving values, both reflected in the public policies and
market forces of 2050; rearranging the basics – production, storage, transmission, distribution, and
use of energy – and perhaps introducing new factors we can’t anticipate. In one possible future,
carbon capture and sequestration breakthroughs give new life to coal; in another, a policy
preference for nuclear technologies prevails. What follows is one future scenario among the many
possible; perhaps not even the most likely scenario, but one that can help illuminate the choices we
face in reaching our greenhouse gas reduction goals while maintaining system reliability, quality
and cost management.

Energy System Architecture and Operations
This 2050 system is more decentralized, contains more – and more diverse – resources, and relies
heavily on Intelligence Technology (IT) for dynamic management and integration. It places a higher
value on system flexibility, and the resources that supply flexibility. “Integration” is not primarily
across generating plants but also between demand and supply sides, and even from customer to
customer ‐‐ the energy flowing not just downhill from plant to user but uphill as well, from user
back into the utility system; and sideways, from user to user. The battery in my plug‐in electric
vehicle (PEV) powers your toaster in the morning, and may even supply backup capacity when the
central grid goes down.
Communities are fully integrated as well. The farm on the corner supplies renewable gas to homes
while waste heat from the industrial plant is fed into an efficient district system.
The priority energy resource of this 2050 system is energy efficiency (as it was in 2010, when it was
the third largest source of electricity in the Pacific Northwest after hydro and coal) integrated into a
modernized electricity grid. New homes and commercial buildings are energy and carbon high
performance building, with consumption and related emissions >80% less than in 2010. This is
achieved by virtue of their passive energy efficient designs, tight building envelopes, high‐efficiency
LED lighting (that produces lower heat loads for the air conditioning required by 2050’s more

frequent heat waves), heat pump or direct gas space and water heating (water preheated with
rooftop solar thermal systems), and solar photovoltaic building skin elements (siding, windows,
roofs).
The priority capacity resource in this scenario is also found on the customer side of the meter.
Those buildings with excess power or thermal energy (or other “distributed” resources) may store it
onsite (in a PEV battery or a fuel cell), or return it to the electric grid or gas supply system for
storage or redistribution. “Smart” appliances talk to the utility “smart grid,” buying and selling
stored energy or capacity (from appliances that can be cycled on and off remotely) according to
schedules mutually agreed to by the customer and utility.
Gas appliances in both residential and commercial uses can also be programmed to respond
remotely to shortages of supply or weather‐related spikes in demand (they might also support
distributed electrical generation that could be called upon during peak power demand).
In 2050, electric and gas systems are also information systems. Achieving the benefits that Smart
Grid technologies offer will require that we think and plan simultaneously for the electric and gas
service system and the integrated role the data system will play in supporting these benefits
This active role for customer‐side electricity resources has enabled faster progress toward a power
grid that is more flexible than today’s system; that can respond more quickly and efficiently to
changes elsewhere across the system, whether it is following loads or reacting to variable
renewable resources ramping up and down. Most of the conventional coal and gas facilities that
served as baseload resources in 2010 have been replaced by newer technologies that operate
efficiently over a range of load factors, (pulverized coal plants were nearly all retired by 2030,
freeing up east‐west transmission that now brings High Plains wind to both West Coast and Mid‐
west markets). New gas turbine technology that can ramp up and down rapidly serves primarily as
integrating resource for a grid that contains wind (in diverse wind regimes), solar, ocean, hydro 1 ,
biomass and some geothermal renewable resources.
Wind and solar operate as “predictable” rather than “dispatchable” resources; the difference is that
while system operators can’t call on a wind‐farm to increase generation when loads increase, they
will know with higher probability than was the case in 2010 the level of output at which that wind‐
farm can continue to generate for the next hour, or day, or week ahead. IT systems will monitor
and predict (1) changing loads, (2) dispatchable demand‐side resources, and (3) available
“predictable” resources. It will automatically dispatch (4) integrating resources – hydro plus new
storage plus gas turbines – to backfill holes. Wind generators also can contract to reduce output to
prevent over‐generation and thereby preserve system balance.

Transmission, Storage and Controls
Such a system design relies on its transmission grid nearly as heavily as did the old architecture. But
today’s transmission grid is an intensively monitored and far more resilient, responsive, reliable and
efficient system that can remotely diagnose and often repair its rare malfunctions. Transmission
facilities are more strategically located and interconnected to be internally reinforcing, linking
together and permitting efficient integration among loads, generation and storage while respecting
environmentally sensitive landscapes and ecosystems. Siting new transmission facilities has

become easier as communities realize its importance in a strategy of lower carbon emissions and
greater energy independence.
Storage facilities are located both at the supply end (pumped storage, compressed air, advanced
batteries, etc.), at load centers (batteries, fuel cells) and within loads (PHEV batteries, remotely‐
dispatched appliance cycling). Sophisticated control systems optimize flows and reduce congestion.
The wide distribution of storage capability across the grid also strengthens system regulation and
stability.

Electricity Generating Resources
In 2050, hydro still supplies + 50% of the region’s electrical energy supply (and a significant share of
the integrating services for wind and solar). That hydro is complemented by a mix of new wind,
solar and other renewables, which together comprise >80% of electrical generation 2 Energy
efficiency standards and investments have held overall load growth to + 0, excluding shifted
transportation load (electric vehicles are estimated to have added 10% to 12% to overall energy
load 3 – assuming 60% of the light duty vehicle fleet is electrically‐powered in 2050 – but has
actually moderated the need for new electrical generating capacity by providing flexible load‐center
storage to the system). The entire system – supply, delivery and demand components ‐‐ is planned
and operated for optimum cost‐effectiveness within hard reliability and carbon emissions
constraints.
Gas

Natural gas supplies for both direct space and water heat, and for electricity generation as
described above, are supplied domestically from both conventional and unconventional (e.g.,shale
gas) resources, and from renewable gas. This renewable gas may come from anaerobic digestion
(animal waste, waste water treatments plants, landfills) or gasification of biomass. Between this
supply, and robust US research, development, demonstration and commercialization of other
renewable and energy efficiency products – and the shifting of most vehicles to electricity, gas and
biofuels – the long‐sought achievement of energy independence has been largely attained. To the
extent energy products are still imported, whether equipment or fuels, our capability to replace
imports with domestically‐sourced products assures the US of price and supply leverage in global
energy markets.
Oregon policies support, and utilities invest in, combined‐heat‐and‐power (CHP) facilities to retrofit
or displace boilers at industrial plants requiring substantial quantities of process heat. Oregon land
use policies encourage co‐location of such plants (which also enable industrial district heating
systems) to reduce stranded investment risks.

Financing and Affordability

The “Western Wind and Solar Integration Study” (NREL/SR‐550‐47781) published by the National
Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in May, 2010, estimated that a wind/solar (30%/5%) system
penetration rate on the WestConnect Grid was technically and operationally feasible even without
the hydro system flexibility available to the PNW grid. WestConnect includes utilities in AZ, NV,
NM, CO and WY.

Early on, Oregon developed a State‐sponsored energy financing platform that made use of State
and local bonding authority, State revenues (including user assessments tied to carbon emissions), a
strengthened and extended public purpose charge, and regulatory support for efficient utility
access to capital markets to provide consistent financing support for realizing this energy future.
The State’s efforts were supported by BPA and utility investments in transmission capacity and
control infrastructure. This financing was particularly important in effectively extending energy
efficiency assistance to low‐income households (including rental housing efficiencies captured
through combined code requirements and loans secured by the properties). The model was not
dissimilar to the public financing that created so much essential 20th century infrastructure, from
dams and transmission lines to interstate highways.

Research
National and Oregon energy research agendas and budgets have received vigorous support over the
last forty years, achieving gains in low‐ or zero‐carbon fuels, energy efficiency (including building
and appliance design, and behavioral response tools), supply and demand side controls, and low‐
carbon generating technologies. A reinvigorated research program will be pursued by the state in
partnership with the federal government. Cost‐effective carbon capture and storage (CSS) for fossil
fuel plants remains elusive; while new energy storage technologies have combined with
sophisticated control systems and wind/solar resource prediction capabilities to integrate a greater
diversity of resources across larger geographic control areas. Conventional nuclear power plants
have been deployed elsewhere in the US, while development interest in the Pacific Northwest
focuses on the “pocket” nuclear designs with passive safety systems, standardized design elements
and shorter development lead times, that were refined at Oregon State University

Regulatory Predictability
Looking back from 2050, it’s clear that the adoption of a mandatory national carbon emissions
reduction policy (cap, cap and trade, tax or other device) proved essential to achieving Oregon –
and national – GHG reduction goals. This single action provided homeowners, businesses and
utilities with the predictability that both incented and enabled them to make carbon reduction
investments at the scale required for deep emissions cuts. The required reductions were ramped in
over time, while price ceilings and floors flattened out the spikes and dips that unnerve investors
and lenders. The reduction curve encouraged innovation in carbon‐reducing technologies and
strategies (and created marketing opportunities for Oregon entrepreneurs).

III. KEY ACTIONS FOR 2020
In all our state’s greenhouse gas reduction strategies, Oregon acknowledges that while it can be a
leader, it cannot by itself materially affect the growth of greenhouse gas emissions without
reciprocal initiatives by other states, by our federal government, and by other countries across the
globe. Attempts to go our own way in isolation would be not only ineffective, but would have
adverse economic effects on Oregon households and businesses. Especially this is true in our
electricity and gas utility sectors, where we are interconnected, by physical ties, access to fuels, and
economics, to the rest of the country and the world. The recommendations that follow should be
read with this qualifier in mind.
Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020

At the same time, we also assert the importance of providing leadership in this sector as Oregon has
done so often in the past, from our transmission arrangement with our neighboring states and with
Canada, to our pioneering work in energy efficiency and least cost planning. Leadership provided
by Oregon and other states is not only essential to achieving essential greenhouse gas outcomes; it
also positions our state to capitalize on emerging national and global clean energy markets. The
recommendations must be read in this context as well.
We explicitly acknowledge the essential role that Least Cost/Integrated Resource Utility Planning
(IRP) has assumed in the planning and decision‐making processes of our state and region over the
last three decades. The setting and achieving of energy and climate policy goals for utilities is best
accomplished within this framework.

1. Develop State Energy and Climate Policy
Oregon should adopt clear, durable, integrated policy preferences on how best to meet reliability,
affordability and environmental goals over a planning horizon of > 20 years, to allow households
and businesses to plan and budget with confidence. The resulting energy policy should address: (1)
utility energy supply, delivery, use and conservation (IOU and COU; electricity and natural gas), and
(2) transportation energy supply, use and conservation; and, (3) environmental, social, and health
outcomes, including impacts on communities and workers. These goals should inform, but not
supersede, prevailing utility IRP requirements and obligations. Oregon should adopt a set of
benchmarks to serve as interim guides towards meeting the goals established in its energy policy.
The benchmarks may speak to statewide and sector specific goals, but must contain language
specifically stating that they do not apply to individual entities. Meeting the state’s climate policy
goals must be recognized as an effort that will require contributions by all citizens and corporations
of the state. Joint planning by the state across fuels (electric and gas) and across sectors (energy,
transport) can then inform both transportation and utility planning efforts. Utility integrated
resource plans, should consider “net GHG reductions” that reflect load shifting between fuels and
meeting new loads that may be emerging from the transportation sector.

2. Energy Efficiency
Develop and implement new standards, codes and incentives to address highly effective yet hard to
deliver energy efficiency measures including but not limited to: appliance and lighting codes and
standards; a retrofit building energy efficiency code; commercial building commissioning; rental
housing codes; utility investment in energy efficiency; and incentives for high performance
buildings.

3. Support and Plan for New Transmission
New transmission capacity for both gas and electricity will be required. Oregon siting standards
should be periodically reviewed to assure that they satisfactorily reflect State and Federal reliability
and safety requirements, the State’s environmental values and regional and State energy policies
that prioritize (a) the transition to enhanced system flexibility, and (b) access to low‐carbon
generating resources such as central station wind and solar. Full development and interconnection
of distributed/load‐center resources (efficiency; demand management; distributed renewables and
storage) should be facilitated. New transmission capacity should give due consideration to using
existing corridors; and new corridors should be created they are shown to be essential to meeting
resource and environmental goals, while assuring power quality and system reliability consistent
Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

with applicable reliability standards and performance criteria (including line separation
requirements).

4. Ramp Down Emissions Associated with Coal Generation
Coal‐fired electricity generation to serve Oregon load emits a significant share of total CO2
emissions attributable to the state. While technological and economic breakthroughs in Carbon
Capture and Sequestration (CCS) or other carbon abatement technologies may provide cost‐
effective solutions in the future, these are not viable options today. Therefore, policy makers must
understand the existing options available to Oregon utilities to begin making substantial reductions
in emissions attributable to conventional coal‐fired generation serving Oregon loads by 2020, and
achieving the additional reductions thereafter necessary to support Oregon’s deliberate,
continuous progress toward achieving its 2050 greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal. The
Legislature should direct and authorize the Oregon Public Utility Commission to direct Oregon
utilities to investigate alternatives to continued use of coal‐fired generation technologies, including
the policies, programs, technologies and measures that might provide a reduction in the emissions
from those sources, consistent with Oregon’s greenhouse gas reduction goals as adopted by the
Legislature. This evaluation should proceed within existing Integrated Resource Planning processes,
including thorough IRP evaluations of the benefits, costs and effects on the quality and reliability of
service of alternative pathways toward meeting the emission reduction goals. Other considerations
may include: (1) reciprocal initiatives by other states or, preferably, by federal action; (2) sufficient
time for an orderly replacement resource planning and acquisition process to assure system
reliability and manage transition costs (and especially impacts to utility employees, local
communities, and businesses and low‐income household customers); (3) sustained progress on
transmission infrastructure development, integration technologies (e.g., electricity storage) and
practices required to bring low carbon variable renewable generating resources into the electricity
grid; (4) success of efforts to reduce emissions in other sectors; and, (5) consideration of effects on
Oregon’s economy and employment.

5. OUS Energy Research Priorities
Oregon should support substantial increases in the federal investment in energy research so that it
is commensurate with its importance to the nation. Oregon, through the Oregon University System,
should invest in research priorities that include: building energy efficiency systems; design‐
integrated solar distributed generation applications; energy efficiency behavioral initiatives;
distributed load center generation, storage (e.g., fuel cells) and control systems; V2G electric
vehicle integration controls and configurations; biomass and ocean energy conversion technologies
and support (e.g., biomass fuel) systems; small‐scale nuclear generating technologies. Research also
should be supported on the social, economic, health, and health equity aspects of changes in
energy generation, storage, and transmission being considered in Oregon.

6. Modern Gas Infrastructure
In the next decade, natural gas infrastructure and operations will need to drive net reductions in
greenhouse gases through: a) harvesting waste heat from generation near thermal loads; b)
combining natural gas with renewable generation, such as solar thermal; c) serving a growing fleet
of natural gas powered vehicles (e.g., centrally fueled fleets, heavy duty vehicles) and d) gathering

and cleaning to pipeline quality renewable natural gas from a wide variety of biogas sources. State
energy policies should be designed to ensure adequate natural gas infrastructure and “the best fuel
for the best use;” these policies should in turn inform utility Integrated Resource Plans. Where a
showing is made of net greenhouse gas reduction potential from the direct use of natural gas,
integration of renewable resources or use of high‐efficiency electrical appliances for critical space
and water heating, State policy should prioritize such use

7. Smart Grid and Integration of Resources
To fully realize the potential of renewable and demand side resources, advances are needed in
technology, information systems, the grid, and system operations. These include Smart Grid
initiatives described in Recommendation 16, and the improvements in the integration of renewable
resources including tapping demand‐side flexibilities as described in Recommendation 23.

adopt a set of benchmarks to serve as interim guides
towards meeting the goals established in its energy policy.
The benchmarks should speak to statewide and sector‐
specific goals, and not apply to specific entities. Joint
planning by the state across fuels (electric and gas) and
across sectors (energy, transport) can then inform both
transportation and utility planning efforts. Utility
integrated resource plans, should consider “net GHG
reductions” that reflect load shifting between fuels and
meeting new loads that may be emerging from the
transportation sector.

2

Align Building Code with GHG Goals: Oregon building and
equipment energy codes should be aligned with its GHG
reduction goals over a planning horizon of > 20 years to
allow households and businesses to plan and budget with
confidence.

Codes and Standards

3

Fuel‐blind Space/Water Heat Standard: Oregon should
establish a life‐cycle fuel‐blind carbon‐efficiency standard
(BTU’s/tonne CO2e assuming the marginal generating
resource) for residential and commercial space and water
heating, and should systematically transition the standard
from incentive into code.

4

Appliance and Lighting Codes and Standards: Oregon
should revisit its appliance and lighting incentive and code
criteria at least every five years to capture the benefits of
likely continuous improvements in efficiencies. For
example, Oregon can adopt (initially for its incentive
programs, then transitioning into code), the Association of
Home Appliance Manufacturers 2010 standards for

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 16



refrigerators, freezers, washers, dryers, dishwashers and
air conditioners. Oregon should look first to advocate for
timely improvements in federal standards, then to
cooperative initiatives with other States.

5

“Retrofit” Building Energy Efficiency Code: Oregon
should develop a “retrofit” energy efficiency code
requirement, developed to reflect life‐cycle cost‐
effectiveness (including a carbon adder) of retrofit
measures, which will be different from cost‐effectiveness
in new construction. Oregon should require that any
residential or commercial building be brought into
compliance with this code at point of property transfer or
major remodel/rehabilitation, with the State also
providing access to financing through existing and new
financing tools.

6

Carbon Efficiency Feebate: Oregon should design and
implement a GHG “feebate” for residential energy use
that imposes a GHG surcharge (to the property tax) on
homes exceeding a “full‐time resident x energy
consumption” metric. Revenues may be applied first to
efficiency retrofits of affected dwellings, then to State
energy efficiency programs generally.

7

Commercial Building Commissioning: Oregon code
should require that all new commercial buildings (> XX sq
ft) undergo building energy systems commissioning as a
condition of building inspector signoff; and to undergo
recommissioning on schedules that are shown to be cost‐
effective.

8

Energy Management Equipment in Building Code:
Oregon building codes should establish minimum energy

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 17



management equipment requirements for new and
retrofit residential and commercial buildings (e.g., setback
thermostats; motion‐detection light switches; “vampire”
load controls; etc.).

9

Rental Housing: Oregon should require third‐party‐
owned rental housing to be brought into compliance with
the Retrofit Efficiency Code at point of sale or major
remodeling but not less often than every ten years.

Finance/Economics/Incentives

10

Invest State Revenues in Energy Efficiency: Oregon
should assign priority, in its investment policies for State
funds (revenues; pension funds), to investing those funds
in Oregon energy efficiency on a showing of comparable
risk‐return.

11

State Energy Financing Platform: Oregon should develop
a State energy facilities financing platform that can attract
and deploy capital investment (equity and debt) raised
from multiple sources (State funds; bond revenues;
private sector investment; utility investment; LID or
neighborhood REIT investment; individual investment;
etc.) on energy efficiency, infrastructure and distributed
generation, relying first upon the Energy Trust of Oregon
(in investor‐owned utility territory) and consumer‐owned
utilities (in their territories) to deploy the funding.
Homeowners and business owners could also qualify to
access the funding.

12

Utility Investment in Energy Efficiency: Where
circumstances (e.g., market barriers; large “lumpy”
investment requirements) suggest value can be added to
Oregon’s existing energy efficiency capture capabilities by

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 18



allowing direct utility investment, the Oregon Public Utility
Commission should have authority to permit such
investments by Investor‐Owned Utilities in energy
efficiency, distributed generation and related
infrastructure (including controls and storage) in a manner
that puts these investments on an even playing field with
supply‐side investments.

13

Incent High Performance Buildings: Oregon should set a
standard for high performance buildings that meet a goal
of reducing life‐cycle building related GHG emissions by 80
percent from the current baseline and provide a financial
incentive (no property tax payments for 20 years?) for the
first 1000 High Performance residences commissioned in
the State; and the first 100 High Performance commercial
structures.

14

Convert Energy Tax Credits into Grants: Oregon and
federal investment tax incentives (BETC; ITC) should be
redesigned as grants (monetized) to allow third party
facility development and non‐profit institutional
development of qualifying facilities to access these
incentives without (as now) being obliged to transfer a
significant share of the value to third‐party financing, legal
and other transaction costs.

15

Authorized RETC for Distributed Energy: Oregon should
allow taxpayers to claim Residential Tax Credits (RETC) for
heat pump water heaters, solar photovoltaic systems and
solar hot water systems and other distributed generation
resources (e.g., Combined Heat/Power [CHP] systems; fuel
cells).

Infrastructure
16

Smart Grid: Oregon State agencies, utilities and
University disciplines should prioritize, deploy and

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 19



demonstrate Smart Grid technologies and associated
information and applications that result in a future utility
system that meets end‐user needs more effectively.
Three broad areas for emphasis are:
(a) distribution/transmission system improvements and
reconfigurations, including distribution‐transmission
interface;
(b) underlying data/information systems; and
(c) introduction of “Smart Grid‐capable” metering,
appliances, V2G vehicle and infrastructure designs and
other interactive elements of a fully‐realized system.
Smart Grid improvements that facilitate integration of
variable renewable resources, energy efficiency, and
taking advantage of opportunities to tap the demand side
to meet needs for capacity and flexibility will be
emphasized. This future system should encourage and
support greater end‐user energy use control while also
addressing privacy, security, access, equity, and technical
considerations. State incentive and regulatory policies for
Smart Grid development, planning, deployment, and
reporting reflects this prioritization and these
considerations.
Standard

17

Support Combined Heat and Power (CHP) with Co‐
location and Other Incentives: Oregon should support
and incent, with land use/zoning variances and
investment incentives, the co‐location of industrial uses
that in turn will support a doubling of CHP capacity by
2015, and a further doubling by 2020.

Standard

18

Support and Plan for New Transmission: New
transmission capacity for both gas and electricity will be
required. Oregon siting standards should be periodically
reviewed to assure that they satisfactorily reflect State
and Federal reliability and safety requirements, the State’s

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 20



environmental values and regional and State energy
policies that prioritize (a) the transition to enhanced
system flexibility, and (b) access to low‐carbon generating
resources such as central station wind and solar. Full
development and interconnection of distributed/load‐
center resources (efficiency; demand management;
distributed renewables and storage) should be facilitated.
New transmission capacity should give due consideration
to using existing corridors; and new corridors should be
created they are shown to be essential to meeting
resource and environmental goals, while assuring power
quality and system reliability consistent with applicable
reliability standards and performance criteria (including
line separation requirements).

19

Modern Gas Infrastructure: In the next decade, natural
gas infrastructure and operations will need to drive net
reductions in greenhouse gases through: a) harvesting
waste heat from generation near thermal loads; b)
combining natural gas with renewable generation, such as
solar thermal; c) serving a growing fleet of natural gas
powered vehicles (e.g., centrally fueled fleets, heavy duty
vehicles) and d) gathering and cleaning to pipeline quality
renewable natural gas from a wide variety of biogas
sources. State energy policies should be designed to
ensure “the best fuel for the best use;” these policies
should in turn inform utility Integrated Resource Plans
(IRPs). Where a showing is made of net greenhouse gas
reduction potential from the direct use of natural gas for
critical space and water heating, State policy should
prioritize such use

Technical

Fuels/Conversion Technologies and Operations
20

Phase Out Emissions Associated with Coal Generation:
Absent technological and economic breakthroughs in

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 21



21

Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) or other carbon
abatement technologies, it appears highly unlikely that an
Oregon 2020 emissions goal (or a 2030 interpolated
target) can be met without a phase‐out of service from
coal‐fired power plants. Thus, subject to the conditions
identified here, Oregon utilities should begin immediately
the planning necessary to cease service to Oregon loads
from coal‐fired generation, with substantial progress
achieved by 2020 and the task largely completed by 2030.
Other conditions include:
(1) reciprocal initiatives by other states or, preferably,
by federal action;
(2) sufficient time for an orderly replacement
resource planning and acquisition process to assure
system reliability and manage transition costs (and
especially impacts to utility employees, local
communities, and businesses and low‐income
household customers);
(3) sustained progress on transmission infrastructure
development, integration technologies (e.g.,
electricity storage) and practices required to bring
low‐carbon variable renewable generating resources
into the electricity grid;
(4) success of efforts to reduce emissions in other
sectors; and,
(5) consideration of effects on Oregon’s economy and
employment.
The process of phasing out coal service should proceed
within prevailing IRP processes for Oregon’s utilities,
including thorough IRP evaluations of the benefits, costs
and effects on quality and reliability of service of alternate
pathways to these goals.
New Generation Attributes: PNW utilities, planners and
regulators should place a priority on the flexibility

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 22



attributes of new generating and demand side resources
to be introduced into the grid (e.g., ramp response rates;
siting for system value)

22

23

Hydropower: Subject to requirements to operate the
Columbia River hydropower system to support healthy
salmonid populations and overall ecosystem function,
federal and non‐federal operators should seek to
maximize the generation and operations flexibility of the
system to reliably serve utility loads, deliver low carbon
power and integrate new low‐carbon resource additions
(including new capacity and storage capabilities where
feasible).
Integration of Demand‐ and Supply‐side Generation and
Loads: Utilities, regulators and legislators, regionally and
in Oregon, should address the planning, regulatory, design
and operating issues that currently frustrate the efficient
integration of new, low‐carbon demand‐ and supply‐side
energy resources into the grid. This may involve
modifying both (1) utility grid operating protocols and (2)
regulatory/incentive signals that frustrate efficient
integration of variable, non‐dispatchable renewable
resources such as wind and solar. Examples of the former
include balancing authorities too constricted to capture
geographic diversity, and static (vs. dynamic in‐hour)
scheduling. Examples of the latter include tax incentives
and environmental attribute markets that may penalize
rather than reward flexible operations of these resources
in ways that may adversely affect efficient system
operations. These actions are additional to, and
interdependent with, new energy management and
storage capabilities mediated by Smart Grid tools.

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 23



24

Regional Integration Services: The State should
collaborate with BPA and other regional parties to ensure
that sufficient ancillary services are available to support
the development of non‐dispatchable/variable renewable
resources, and to ensure that the provision of these
services does not raise rates to Oregon consumers and
does not impair electric reliability.

25

Solar Pre‐Heating of Water: Where economically
competitive (when compared to other distributed
renewable energy sources) and physically feasible (e.g.,
available installation space; solar access), solar water
heating equipment should be a preferred and incentivized
pre‐heat treatment of residential and commercial hot
water supplies. Incentives for this technology will be
expected to broaden the market and lower both
equipment and installation costs – as is the expectation
for PV technology.

Other

26

Support and Strengthen Existing State and Regional
Energy Efficiency Tools: Oregon and the Pacific
Northwest have benefited greatly over the years from the
planning and delivery capabilities of the NW Conservation
and Power Planning Council, the NW Energy Efficiency
Alliance, the Energy Trust of Oregon, CleanEnergyWorks
(Portland), Battelle NW Laboratory and other entities.
Oregon and its investor and consumer‐owned utilities
must continue to invest in, and extend the reach and
capacity of, these institutions if it is to meet its climate
and energy goals

27

Incent Urban Density, Design: Oregon metropolitan areas
should give preferential property tax treatment and other

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

Page 24



incentives to encourage higher density common‐wall
residential developments that also offer energy efficient
access to transit and urban services (“locational”
efficiencies).

28

Water Efficiency: Oregon should prioritize water
efficiency in the supply, delivery, use and disposal of
water supplies, to mitigate the energy consumption
involved in water resource management.

Research

29

Energy, Carbon Research Funding and Agenda: Oregon
should advocate, through its Congressional delegation and
in national policy forums (e.g., WGA) for strengthened
national energy and carbon research budgets, with
funding allocated based upon least cost, most promising
technological and behavioral pathways to achieving
national energy and carbon goals.

30

OUS Energy Research Priorities: Oregon should support,
through the Oregon University System, research priorities
that include: building energy efficiency systems; design‐
integrated solar distributed generation applications;
energy efficiency behavioral initiatives; distributed load
center generation, storage (e.g., fuel cells) and control
systems; V2G electric vehicle integration controls and
configurations; biomass and ocean energy conversion
technologies and support (e.g., biomass fuel) systems;
small‐scale nuclear generating technologies.

31

Advanced Energy Research Initiative: Oregon should
consider an Energy Systems Advanced Research Center to
attract and concentrate the science and engineering
talent to take a leadership position in development and
application of selected energy technologies and

Oregon Global Warming Commission Energy Roadmap to 2020
Energy Technical Committee

applications where opportunities for Oregon businesses
can be identified.

32

Equipment Replacement Protocols: NEEA, ETO and
utilities should develop and maintain protocols for
commercial and industrial equipment replacement that
weigh embedded carbon against evolving equipment
efficiencies. The protocols should be easily accessible to
companies deciding whether to keep or replace
equipment.

Transportation and Land Use Roadmap to
2020
Report to the Oregon Global Warming Commission
The following report, Transportation and Land Use (T&LU) Roadmap to 2020, was developed by the
T&LU Technical Committee of the Oregon Global Warming Commission (OGWC). Technical
Committee members are listed in Appendix A of this report.

I. PURPOSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of the Committee was to develop and prioritize a set of strategies and actions for
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and land use choices to meet Oregon’s
2020 greenhouse gas (GHG) goal. The recommendations will be considered by the Oregon Global
Warming Commission for inclusion in the Interim Roadmap to 2020/Report to the new Governor
and Legislature, to state agencies, and to Oregon’s Congressional delegation. Recommendations
may also guide private sector investments and university research agendas.
After several months of deliberations the Committee narrowed the Key Actions from a possible 120
actions down to 12. Appendix B contains the consolidated Inventory of Actions developed by T&LU
Technical Committee. The Committee’s “Clean Dozen” are more fully described in Section III – Key
Actions For 2020 of this report. In summary they are:
1. Change the Way We Fund Transportation
2. Develop New Funding Sources
3. Expand Urban Transit
4. Create Complete Neighborhoods
5. Keep Urban Footprints Compact
6. Move Freight the Low‐Carbon Way
7. Plan to Mitigate GHGs and Adapt to Climate Change
8. Expand Intercity Transportation Options/Choice
9. Reduce Demand by Increasing Options
10. Manage and Price Parking
11. Support Electric Vehicles
12. Adopt Low Carbon Fuel Standard
The Committee noted that the greater part of its recommendations are focused on transportation
and land use choices in Oregon’s urban areas, although many are applicable statewide (more

efficient freight and intercity transit, along with access to electric vehicle technologies, offer
opportunities to urban and rural Oregonians alike). The focus was neither accidental nor reflecting
an urban bias; rather it was recognizing that the majority of efficiency gains and greenhouse gas
savings must be contributed by residents of Oregon’s cities, where densities make options like
transit more cost‐effective and feasible. By contrast, access to shopping and services in many of
Oregon’s smaller communities is already relatively clustered and efficient.

II. FUTURE STATEMENTS
The following Future Statements are intended to describe what the year 2050 might look like with
carbon reduction in alignment with Oregon State goals, based on the implementation of the Actions
for 2020 noted above and throughout this document (i.e. back‐casting exercise from 2050). It is
critical to align these actions with our 2050 visions recognizing that these actions can be either
enabling (funding shifts) or constraining (land use and other actions reducing VMT/demand) over
the long‐term. The Committee used these statements to guide our development of present day key
actions that need to occur by 2020. The statements are categorized into four topic areas:



How We Move Goods



How We Move People



How We Use Land



How We Make Transportation Choices, and Fund Them

How We Move Goods in Oregon in 2050
Oregon’s economy remains trade‐dependent and export‐led, and the transportation system serves
the engines driving the economy, supporting the growth of family‐wage jobs. The system is viewed
as moving people and goods rather than vehicles; and the design, planning, development, and
usage of transportation reflects that shift. Market forces in the form of customer demand, cost
reductions, and improved efficiencies and technology drive reduction in GHG emissions from freight
movement. Awareness of emissions and opportunities to reduce costs are second nature to front‐
line staff operating machinery and vehicles in the movement of freight. Policy decisions take a
systems approach and consider safety, economics, and GHGs.
Policy
Land has been preserved and (re‐)zoned for industrial use on, adjacent to, and near highway
interchanges and freight transportation corridors, where this would improve efficiency of freight
movement, multiply intermodal opportunities and efficiencies, and reduce total vehicle miles
traveled by trucks in Oregon. This also has enabled distribution and logistics complexes to be
established at or near the ports of Morrow and Umatilla with product being shuttled between
Portland and the mid‐Columbia by barge.
Federal regulations implemented in 2007 and beyond regarding heavy‐duty diesel engines have had
a substantial impact as the trucks and engines built immediately prior to new regulations have been
completely retired or replaced. Public policy requires manufacturers to improve the efficiency and
reduce the emissions of truck engines through the use of market‐based approaches.

As rail is usually more fuel‐and‐carbon‐efficient for overland freight, and where rail is an option,
land use planning has anticipated a need to better integrate freight rail. Long‐range land use plans
facilitate freight rail movement by supporting the development of industrial parks and “freight
villages” adjacent to rail ramps where loads can be consolidated for shipment by rail or broken up
for distribution. Markets for increased use of short line services have been identified and
developed, and investments in infrastructure improvements have been funded.
Operations
All cities, counties, and MPOs working with the trucking industry have identified viable, important
freight connectors, arterials, and routes. All signals are timed on these routes to allow large trucks
to pass through without stopping while driving the speed limit. This reduces idling and
consequently fuel consumption and GHG emissions. Freight vehicles of all kinds operate with
limited or no idling.
Both US and international air space is opened up to allow flights (both cargo and passenger) to fly
the most direct route possible between airports. Operations will be highly organized so that take‐
offs and landings can be managed in a way that allows planes to use very little fuel on descent and
final approach. The airplanes themselves are fueled by lower‐carbon fuels.
Design
All undivided roads have adequate passing and climbing lanes to reduce queuing of trucks and cars,
thereby reducing emissions. Where possible on divided highways and where efficiency gains are
possible, existing capacity exists and does not constrain other vehicle movement, truck‐only lanes
allow trucks consistent, efficient movement reducing starting, stopping, and slowing.
Process Improvement
Improvements in packaging have continued, enabling more freight to be shipped in fewer trips
reducing both fuel consumption and GHG emissions.
Better technology and information about the transportation system has improved the modeling and
operation of pick‐up/delivery activities. This includes the ability to incorporate the operations of
other fleets and private vehicles and their response to unpredicted problems on the network.
Capacity
Oregon ports and airports, where scale allows, have the facilities and service they need to capture
95% inbound and outbound freight within their market service areas. Oregon shippers no longer
need to rely on transporting goods to/from ports and airports in California, Washington, British
Columbia, and elsewhere.
Class I freight railroads (e.g. Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific) have invested in new
track capacity in Oregon and beyond enabling them to capture more long‐haul freight volume
moving into and out of Oregon. They are also cooperating to make more efficient two‐way use of
parallel tracking where it exists. Short‐line railroads have also expanded to handle shorter distance
freight movement.
Vehicle Manufacturing

Transportation vehicle manufacturers have modified designs (trucks, trains, airplanes, ships, etc.) to
become more fuel‐efficient and to reduce GHG emissions. Innovations in engine design, propulsion
technology, aerodynamics, and fuel type and consumption allow for more freight to be hauled
longer distances with fewer emissions.

How We Move People in Oregon in 2050
We’ve come a long way. In the forty years since 2010, Oregonians have thoughtfully, deliberately
and persistently shifted the way we access work, school, play and shopping, especially in Oregon’s
urban areas where population densities support greater efficiencies.
Much like 1973’s Senate Bill 100 laid the foundation for decades of wise land use in Oregon, the
legislature adopted the “Options Now” bill, launching a mix of immediate and long‐term actions
setting Oregon on the path to a fossil‐fuel free transportation system. Legislators recognized that
wise transportation is the other side of the coin of wise land use. The cornerstone of the Options
Now bill was the requirement that all Oregon cities larger than 10,000 people develop “Complete
Community” Plans. These plans were a first step toward meeting local aspirations to create and
maintain livable, vibrant communities that can accommodate a majority of non‐work trips via
walking, biking, shared rides, and, where available, public transportation
Oregon legislators recognized that every dollar invested in providing transportation options keeps
more dollars in the Oregon economy by reducing money exported to pay for petroleum. Oregon
wisely shifted investments from those that worsened our petroleum addiction to those that
boosted state and local economies.
Over the past four decades Oregon has retained most of the billions of dollars that would have
otherwise been exported to pay for petroleum. The “Options Now” program became one of the
most powerful economic development strategies in state history.
For four decades, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) within Oregon’s metropolitan areas and major cities
have been steadily dropping as people lived, worked, studied and played in greater proximity. This
was accomplished by the state steadily increasing the share of transportation capacity funds and
incentives going to rail, transit, bicycling and walking.
For most Oregonians, it’s easy to walk, bike or take transit to work, school, parks, shop, worship and
to visit with friends. For longer trips, Oregon’s major cities are connected by quick, clean, frequent
and convenient rail service. Rural areas have travel and vehicle choices that are both lower‐carbon
and lower‐cost.
As the state, regional and local governments invested in building more and better transportation
options, use of those options increased. Now, options for walking, bicycling, transit and driving
make up a truly balanced system capable of meeting State GHG emission reduction targets set
nearly 40 years earlier.
The legislature created an innovative system to reward ODOT, cities and counties for policies and
projects that reduced petroleum use and GHG emissions. From Astoria to Ashland and Burns to
Brookings, policies were adopted to determine and pay the true cost (including environmental
consequences) of parking and driving, along with comparable costs of other modes of travel.
Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 31



In 2050, nearly 90% of the miles traveled by vehicles in Oregon are from electric and other low‐or
non‐carbon vehicles. And most of the electricity consumed by those vehicles is Oregon‐based
renewable resources. Many of the parts of those electric vehicles are made by Oregon workers, as
is the technology that contributes to a more efficient operation of or transportation system.
There was concern early on that electric vehicles, with their lower operating costs, could create new
pressures for urban sprawl. But Oregon’s commitment to preserving the values embedded in its
land use laws, together with a public transportation system that continuously improved its offerings
created offsetting incentives to live and work within urban growth boundaries.
Oregonians now live longer than any other Americans. We get more exercise because we walk and
bike more, and therefore have lower rates of many chronic diseases. After decades of reducing
vehicle emissions; we have lower rates of asthma and other respiratory diseases.
The critical path to 2050 was established by two key policies offered in the “Options Now”
legislation:
1. Establish pioneering least cost transportation planning that focused investment of our
limited transportation budget in providing Oregonians with options that are both lower‐cost
and lower‐carbon.
2. Reward ODOT, cities and counties for adopting policies that reduce fossil fuel consumption,
vehicle miles traveled, and GHG emissions.

How We Use Land in Oregon in 2050
Oregon’s shift to a low‐carbon economy has given us, in 2050, the opportunity to live more
prosperous, healthier lives by making the right long‐term choices. Starting in 2010, anticipation of
our impact 40 years hence became a foundational principle in the region for planning and
developing our urban areas, using our natural resources and rural lands, and transporting our
people, goods, and services. The highly energy‐efficient homes and offices that have dominated the
market over these four decades are not only much less expensive to operate and maintain, but with
ever more sophisticated design have proven to be more comfortable and healthier to live in as well.
Oregon’s land use patterns and practices have evolved with each decade of progress, and
essentially will look to continue developing new urban constraints. By 2050, new development and
redevelopment reflect compact, efficient mixed‐use settlement patterns created largely through
redevelopment and infill; our communities in 2050 have approximately the same footprint they did
in 2012. 4 Statewide intercity and interregional networks of transit service, broadband, and
coordinated freight movement have enhanced personal and business mobility and accessibility at
no net increase in industrial land consumption.
Highly energy‐efficient building stock, assembled in more compact mixed‐use neighborhoods result
in increased convenience of urban living. More Oregonians have more choices of lifestyles with a
4 2012 is recognized as a transition year as current UGB analyses will be complete in both the Eugene‐

Springfield and Portland Metro regions. It’s recommended that UGB reviews post‐2012 include no expansion
options together with Complete Community Plans.

smaller footprint but greater livability. As the lower‐density neighborhoods from the last half of the
20th century were redeveloped, neighborhood centers for shopping and services were coupled with
on‐demand local transit to gain new efficiencies and convenience.
Greatly increased and convenient access to shared cars, walking, cycling, transit, and other services
have allowed people to reduce their average driving per household, and downsize their household
transportation costs. Urban households now own only one car on average. Commercial shared
vehicles and expanded access to the full range of convenient transit options have allowed families
and individuals to avoid many of the high costs associated with buying, operating, and maintaining
cars for longer trips.
Local governments hardly need to build new roads, and are directing scarce dollars to maintaining
and improving existing infrastructure.
Rural Oregon still relies greatly on personal autos and trucks, but these are efficient low‐carbon and
electric vehicles with an extended range. More efficient freight vehicles and IT‐managed
collection/delivery systems support more robust rural economies and better linkages between
urban and rural places, communities, and economies statewide. Oregon’s farms have efficient
access to both local and global markets, and this diversification helps stabilize farm incomes.
Rural Oregon is also the source of much of the energy we use to power our vehicles, homes and
businesses. Energy comes from wind, solar, biofuels, and combined‐heat‐and‐power or
cogeneration facilities at lumber‐mills, dairies, wastewater treatment plants and landfills.
To prevent further urban spread, communities in the lands along and within 10 miles either side of
the I‐5 corridor ‐‐ the part of Oregon that will be home to most of our population in 2050, as in 2010
‐‐ have adopted land‐use strategies where living, working, learning, and experiencing nature are
substantially co‐located and easily accessible.
Roles for State agencies, local governments and businesses have been realigned to focus on
sustainable development principles. Agencies and businesses have shifted from the traditional
linear “take‐make‐waste” production model to a circular “borrow‐use‐return” production system.
Shifting to this closed‐loop approach has lead to cost savings, increased productivity, and ultimately
to a competitive advantage for business while improving our quality of life and conserving nature.
To create a low‐carbon, prosperous Oregon of 2050, we built on our historic land use and
transportation policies, adopting a more rigorous integrated approach to land use and
transportation planning that incorporates the following elements:
1. Building and redeveloping our communities to make them more convenient places to live,
with or without a car. We added more destinations within walking distance of our homes
and jobs; made the public realm more people‐friendly and safer for pedestrians, cyclists and
transit riders; and reduced the number of trips that required an automobile.
2. Developing a statewide system for intercity public transportation, in close partnership with
private sector providers, local communities, public agencies, and others. Making it possible
to inhabit not just a neighborhood but an entire state as a pedestrian. This extended the

reach of citizens and created new luster for Oregon’s international reputation as an
environmental leader. Using the revenues from new funding sources like congestion pricing
allows us to fund efficient options such as urban and intercity transit. This brings
transportation choices to both urban and rural Oregonians.
3. Creating stronger, safer and more convenient links between the amenities in the public
realm (parks, squares, public facilities, access to nature, beauty, etc.) and smaller, more
efficient building and site designs.
4. Using transportation system pricing—tolls, transit fares, parking charges—to ensure that
the people who choose to make heavy use of scarce transportation system capacity thereby
creating congestion, pollution and GHGs pay the real cost of that use. Getting the prices
right ensured market signals that allowed us to make smarter choices about where we live,
how and when we moved around, which reduced the carbon emissions caused by driving.
5. Changing the way we raised and decided how to spend our scarce transportation dollars so
we were getting the least‐cost, biggest‐bang for our buck system. This is defined as
maximum mobility and accessibility for people, goods and services at the least cost in
dollars, air quality, land consumption and GHG emissions.
6. Prioritizing the use of now‐scarce gasoline and diesel fuels and associated infrastructure to
support rural economies and goods movement, and backing it up with both public policy
and public investment.
Technological development played a central role in Oregon’s transition to a low‐carbon future.
However, Oregon’s strategy of developing a diverse set of living, working and transportation
choices for families and businesses avoided the overreliance on technological “silver bullets”. This
strategy allowed Oregon to continue protecting its farm, forest and wild lands as they coped with
the stresses of adapting to the unavoidable climate change effects of water scarcity, variable land
productivity and pressures on existing ecosystems accustomed to climate stability.

How We Make Transportation Choices, and Fund Them in Oregon in 2050
Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Oregon’s transportation sector involves different
institutional arrangements, policies, as well as direct actions (e.g., fleet conversion to low‐carbon
vehicles and fuels). These institutional changes were essential in enabling Oregon’s transportation
and land use institutions to become catalysts of change, enabling us to connect different uses and
users, to think in terms of systems, of systemic change, and of collaborative efforts across
boundaries instead of isolated actions that failed to connect and reinforce each other strategically.
Allocating GHG Emissions Among Emitters
Oregon early on reached agreement on the amount and timing of needed emissions reductions
from transportation and other sectors that are sources of GHGs, giving Oregon citizens and
businesses carbon predictability. GHG allocations were based on technical feasibility, amount of
the reduction, cost, timing, and equity impacts. Different sub‐sectors within transportation (e.g.,
air/sea/land freight, business, transit, and private vehicles) have allocations that declined over time
at different rates, and to different levels (that still, in aggregate, meet an overall transportation

T&LU Technical Committee

Page 34



sector allocation). Allocations within Oregon also conform to a national GHG budget, captured in a
national “cap” mechanism, so Oregon’s allocation reflects its fair share.
Planning
Transportation and land use planning in Oregon shifted to a “least cost planning” basis that
internalizes the economic, environmental, social and other identifiable costs of fuel choices, land
use actions, and GHG emissions. Planning and infrastructure investing for reduced GHG emissions
consistent with State goals were embedded into planning protocols as a fixed limiting condition.
Modeling tools for such a least cost path have been developed and applied, allowing for plans that
can meet GHG reduction goals while optimizing for multiple attributes (e.g., safety; congestion‐
avoidance; travel time reliability; accessibility; modal share; etc.). Infrastructure investments and
operational are consistent with the least cost plans.
“Locational” Costs Assessment
Urban areas, where most of the population lives in 2050, apply the lessons of least cost planning to
integrating transportation with locational land use decisions. Internet‐accessed models now display
transportation “locational” costs (travel time/accessibility; travel costs; emissions effects; health
effects) of choices of where to live and work. Businesses seeking new locations clearly can access
what their shipping/distribution costs will be and their access to skilled work force. These costs can
be integrated with other locational costs (e.g., energy, water, and services) to give those locating a
residence, business, institutional or government office a more complete picture of the
consequences of different location choices.
Transportation Funding and Cost Allocation
It was clear before 2010 that funding models for transportation were not working. The purchasing
power of gas tax revenues were declining as the need to maintain existing and build new
infrastructure was growing. More efficient mobility and accessibility were required for both freight
and people. Existing funding models were also failing to capture the full range of costs created by
transportation, in particular the costs of building capacity to accommodate peak transportation
demand, and the costs of pollution and the increases in GHG emissions. Oregon pioneered a
“utility” pricing model that levied a base (“capacity”) charge for access to the transportation
infrastructure (roads, transit, etc.); a usage‐based (“energy”) charge for each user’s annual share of
roadway, airshed, and GHG budget consumed; and a congestion (“peaking”) charge to reflect peak
period use. “Congestion pricing,” together with real time information on traffic flows and
slowdowns, now helps us avoid traffic jams and rush hours which contributes to more efficient use
of our transportation infrastructure. As well, because demand is managed we now can avoid
building a great deal of new infrastructure. Traffic – vehicle, pedestrian, transit, and bicycle –
moves efficiently and predictably, reduces stress for all, and reduces costs and delays for
commercial traffic. Computers designed for privacy and electronic applications accessible to drivers
facilitate movement and access.
Research and Commercialization
Oregon has become a technical and business leader in developing advanced transportation
solutions; building off its base and exploiting its comparative advantage already apparent in 2010.
Modeling, planning, applied technology and user behavioral studies are combined into a cycle of

constant investment and improvement in moving people and goods efficiently and equitably. The
vehicles may be made elsewhere, but the systems that make them work are made in Oregon.

III. KEY ACTIONS FOR 2020
The following Key Actions were developed by reviewing numerous local and regional Climate
Change Action Plans, and where appropriate, new and enhanced action items were developed. The
top 12 Key Actions, our “Clean Dozen,” are listed below:
1. Change the Way We Fund Transportation
2. Develop New Funding Sources
3. Expand Urban Transit
4. Create Complete Neighborhoods
5. Keep Urban Footprints Compact
6. Move Freight the Low‐Carbon Way
7. Plan to Mitigate GHGs and Adapt to Climate Change
8. Expand Intercity Transportation Options/Choice
9. Reduce Demand by Increasing Options
10. Manage and Price Parking
11. Support Electric Vehicles
12. Adopt Low Carbon Fuel Standard
While this list represents the T&LU Technical Committee’s top 12 actions, many more actions were
considered (see Appendix B). The process concluded that most of these actions, including but not
limited to the top 12, will be needed to reach our 2020 and 2050 State goals.

1. Change the Way We Fund Transportation
Develop and deploy a “utility” funding model for State and local transportation infrastructure,
transit fleets and operations, and other transportation costs. Such a model should include:



A base (“capacity”) “access” based charge to all who use any part of the system, whether
driving, biking, busing, or using goods and services delivered from the system;



An (“energy”) “usage” based charge (i.e. VMT charge) to reflect the amount one uses the
system, that includes both the cost of infrastructure and externalities (e.g., airshed pollutant
contribution; carbon emissions);



A (“peak”) “congestion” based charge to reflect peak period use of the system.

Oregon has relied for decades on a gas tax applied to light‐duty vehicles to fund the State’s portion
of transportation capital and operating costs (heavy duty freight vehicles pay a weight‐mile tax
rather than a fuel tax) as directed by the State Constitution. This reliance on the gas tax should
Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 36



come to an end for three reasons. First, the amount of the gas tax is fixed and has declined in
purchasing power due to the combined influence of inflation, dramatic increases in transportation
infrastructure costs, and the effect of more efficient vehicles. Second, proceeds from the tax are
directed constitutionally solely to expensive highway‐related costs, leaving other least‐cost mobility
and accessibility solutions unfunded. Third, transportation charges should be levied commensurate
with use of the system (as highway freight charges now are) rather than more narrowly on the
amount of fuel used. A change in Oregon’s Constitution will be required to transition to a ‘utility’
funding model.
“Utility” rate design evolved from electric and gas utilities as a way to allocate costs fairly and
according to use of the system. In the case of transportation, a “utility” design would charge all
parties a base or “access” rate because all parties benefit from the system, either by using the
highways, buses and trains directly, or relying on them to bring them goods and services.
A “usage” charge would reflect miles traveled in the system and how efficiently those miles are
traveled. The usage charge would reflect miles traveled by different modes (e.g., auto, bus, train,
bicycle) and the efficiency of the mode (e.g., an average emissions per VMT/passenger for a bus
rider; an efficiency rating that might be captured instead as a graduated registration fee within the
“access” charge).
A “peak” or “congestion” charge would be triggered when vehicles create congestion, and would
reward those who use available real‐time traffic information to avoid congested sections of the
system at times of congestion (thus avoiding the need to incur additional capital costs of new
facilities to accommodate the increased congestion).
This strategy for pricing publicly‐supplied transportation services (roads, buses, trains) should: (a)
more fairly allocate all costs to users (including land consumption, air pollution and climate impact
costs); (b) provide price signals which create incentives for the public to use existing infrastructure
more efficiently in meeting their transportation needs; and, (c) lower pollution and emissions per
person‐mile traveled because of gains in efficiency.
The above action will only work if we can truly define the total cast of the transportation system.

2. Develop New Funding Sources
Develop new, stable sources of funding for climate‐friendly transportation.
It is imperative that every transportation dollar spent move us closer to meeting the state’s
greenhouse gas reduction goals. However, Oregon’s current method of funding transportation is
inflexible and unstable, and thinly spread funds are insufficient to meet our needs. Oregon has a
constitutional requirement to use gas tax dollars on road improvements instead of on a broader
suite of transportation alternatives that could achieve “least cost” mobility and access. Oregon is
also one of only four states with no sales tax. To make critical investments in transportation
infrastructure, operations and programs that will enable us to meet our GHG reduction goals, we
need new sources of funding that are diverse, stable, predictable and flexible, as well as moving
towards a ‘utility’ based methodology described above. Included in the development of the utility
method would be defined approaches for governance, administration, and allocation of revenues
Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 37



generated from the utility rate base. Existing authorities and commissions may not be correctly
structured to administer a new rate.
The T&LU Technical Committee did not fully explore the viability or revenue‐raising potential of all
possible new sources of funding; however, the following have been identified as options in need of
future exploration by the T&LU Technical Committee, the Global Warming Commission, the
Governor and Legislature, and others:



Maximizing the use of all discretionary funds (e.g. federal funds for multimodal
transportation).



Offering drivers the opportunity to make a voluntary contribution to an alternative
transportation fund to offset the impact of their driving behavior when they renew their
vehicle registration or driver’s license.



Reducing the senior medical deduction for high‐income seniors and dedicating savings to
Oregon’s Special Transportation Fund to support special needs transit.



Implementing taxes on the act of parking or imposing a business license tax based on the
number of parking spaces a business makes available for employees and the public.



Dedicating state lottery revenue to multimodal transportation.



Expanding payroll tax authority and implementing and raising payroll taxes to fund transit.

3. Expand Urban Transit
Expand Urban Transit to Provide Travel Choices, Reduce Carbon Intensity of Travel, and Curb
Vehicle Miles Traveled.



Expand and improve public transportation infrastructure and operations in the state’s urban
areas to provide lower carbon intensity travel options that reduce the number of vehicle
miles traveled, while meeting the access and mobility needs of commuters, low‐income
citizens, seniors, disabled persons, school kids, recreationalists, and others who because of
circumstance or choice seek public transportation options.



Extend coverage and/or increase frequency and capacity of urban transit service to
urbanized areas with transit‐supportive land use policies; shaping the level of service to
density factors and density development goals consistent with transit agency policies.



Provide separated lanes where possible and/or traffic signal priority for public
transportation vehicles to reduce travel time, reduce idling, and improve the reliability and
operating efficiency of transit service.

The benefits of public transportation are many. At the national level:



Public transportation’s overall effects save the United States 4.2 billion gallons of gasoline
annually: more than 3 times the amount of gasoline imported from Kuwait.



Households near public transit drive an average of 4,400 fewer miles than households with
no access to public transit.

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 38





Communities that have invested in public transit reduce the nation’s carbon emissions by 37
million metric tons annually. This is equivalent to the GHG emissions from all the electricity
used by New York City; Washington, DC; Atlanta; Denver; and Los Angeles – combined!



One person switching to public transit can reduce daily carbon emissions by 20 pounds, or
more than 4,800 pounds in a year. A single commuter switching his or her commute to
public transportation can reduce a household’s carbon emissions by 10%, or up to 30% if he
or she eliminates a second car. 5

The Federal Transit Administration has also assessed the carbon footprint of transit agencies and
compared their performance to that of other modes. 6 FTA’s analysis found that “national averages
demonstrate that public transportation produces significantly lower GHG emissions per passenger
mile than private vehicles.” 7 Analysis specific to TriMet found riders emitting 53% less GHG per
passenger mile than the national average for single‐occupancy private vehicles. 8
GHG emission reductions at the community level are attributable to the provision of transit service
through three pathways:


Mode Shift: Benefits from directly shifting trips from more carbon‐intensive modes (low‐
occupancy private vehicles) to less carbon‐intensive modes (bus and rail transit).



Congestion Relief: Benefits through improved operating efficiency of private automobiles,
and commercial vehicles, including reduced idling and stop‐and‐go traffic.



Land‐Use Factor: Benefits produced through transit enabling more compact land‐use
patterns that promote walking and cycling, shorter and less frequent trips in private
automobiles, and reduced private vehicle ownership.

Modeling commissioned by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), indicates
that the MTA helps avoid the emission of 8.24 metric tons of GHG emissions for every 1 metric ton
that its own operations emit. This number can and does vary from region to region. Even within the
MTA service region (the largest transit‐served area in the country), the “avoidance factor” at the
sub‐regional level varied from about 2 to 20, with 8.24 being a weighted average for the entire
region. 9
While the same modeling has not yet been fully run for TriMet or other Oregon transit districts,
initial TriMet analyses using a similar approach suggest an avoidance factor of approximately 1.84

due to mode shift and congestion relief alone. However, this likely substantially underestimates the
overall avoidance factor since it excludes the emissions avoided due to more compact development
patterns enabled by transit (the most significant factor in the MTA analysis). The “land use factor”
is likely to be a significant factor in the Portland region, where much of the documented GHG
savings from the transportation and land use sector comes from lowering over time VMT in the
Portland region as a result of more compact development within the urban growth boundary. Even
without this land use factor being considered, TriMet services reduces nearly two tons of GHGs for
every single ton it emits, making the expansion of high‐quality, productive transit service a key
reduction strategy for GHGs from transportation and land use for urban areas in Oregon.

4. Create Complete Communities
Require the development and implementation of “Complete Community Plans” for all urban areas
that are subject to Comprehensive Planning in the State of Oregon (cities over 10,000).
“Complete Community Plans” (e.g. 20 minute neighborhoods) are intended to meet local
aspirations for creating and maintaining livable, vibrant communities that can accommodate a
majority of non‐work trips via walking, biking, shared rides, and, where available, public
transportation. Complete community plans should include, but not be limited to:



Higher density, mixed‐use zoning and development incentives aligned with public transit
and a connected system of “complete” streets that include pedestrian amenities and bicycle
facilities (bike boulevards, lanes, parking).



Parking management plans that limit parking in order to allow more efficient use of land
and to balance parking supply with actual demand.



Land use plans that identify a development and implementation strategy of key community
amenities to fit local aspirations for shopping, parks, schools, libraries, public plazas, farmers
markets, and other places for people to congregate and meet everyday needs.



Housing plans that balance housing needs for all income levels and housing types and
leverage access to public transit, walking, and bicycles.

Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD) would be responsible for
statewide rule‐making and review of local comp plans to ensure compliance for complete
community plans.
Collective research conducted by Metro during the 2010 Update to the Regional Transportation
Plan on trip generation rates shows complete neighborhoods and communities with compact urban
form, access to transit and a greater mix of uses generates shorter vehicle trips with a 20‐50%
reduction in vehicular trips when compared to rates in lower‐density, suburban style development.
The finding confirms that ITE trip generation rates tend to overestimate automobile trips for
compact, mixed‐use development patterns. Recent data collection in areas with these development
characteristics within the Portland region showed an average reduction of 40 percent between the
ITE vehicle trip rates and observed trips.

5. Keep Urban Footprints Compact
Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 40



Keep employment and population growth within existing UGBs.
Land within Oregon is considered a finite resource and must serve future generations. In addition
to urban needs, the State’s lands must serve agricultural, forest, and natural habitat purposes.
Therefore, with limited exceptions (i.e. allowing flexibility within UGBs without modifying total
urban land supply), we must accommodate residential and employment growth within existing
urban growth boundaries by focusing new development on vacant developable land or through
infill and redevelopment. This requirement would take effect after December 2012 and exceptions
should only be approved for specific uses that cannot be accommodated within an existing UGB or
for growth that accommodates integrated transportation and land use planning for complete
communities.
Objectives would focus on land conservation and include:
•

Strategies to better balance housing and employment within UGBs in order to minimize
expansion of urban “travel sheds.”

•

Brownfield redevelopment. While difficult, efforts to minimize urban footprints by cleaning
up and reusing large parcels of mostly vacant land should be accelerated, partnerships
fostered, and incentives developed.

•

Transit Oriented Developments to better leverage mixed‐use high‐density development
with transit investments.

Comparisons between urban areas that expand land areas and those that restrict urban growth to
inside existing growth boundaries show that vehicle miles of travel and GHG emissions can be
reduced up to 20 percent over 20 years at growth rates between one to two percent per year.

6. Move Freight the Low‐Carbon Way
Reduce carbon emissions from freight movement in Oregon and help improve the efficiency and
cost‐effectiveness of freight movement.
The freight community has a number of opportunities to contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas
emissions. Because freight movement competes on a regional, national and global scale, policies
and programs must be harmonized with other states and countries to avoid unintended
consequences. Those low‐carbon strategies that offer the greatest potential are those that will
both reduce carbon emissions from freight movement in Oregon while helping improve the
efficiency and cost‐effectiveness of freight movement.



Improve tools and transparency to accurately show how freight moves through the system
in order to improve efficiency of freight movement and infrastructure investment. This
includes the development and deployment of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS)
elements to inform drivers of existing conditions and route alternatives as well as the
collection and sharing of truck trip routing data to identify where operational or
infrastructural inefficiencies exist.

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 41





Make strategic investments in multi‐modal freight transportation, including intermodal
freight transshipment facilities as well as infrastructure capacity to enable cost‐effective
mode shifting over time from less carbon‐efficient modes (e.g., truck, air) to more carbon‐
efficient modes (e.g., rail) for medium and long‐haul freight movement. Ensure such
investments are commensurate with and result in an identifiable public benefit (consistent
with Least Cost Planning principles) and leverage private investments where possible.



Site industrial land/facilities along key freight corridors and interchanges, and support and
conserve regional significant industrial areas that may provide for future intermodal
facilities and efficient local deliveries.



Implement market‐based incentive programs to incent truck and rail fleets to switch to
more efficient engines and fuel types and to adopt alternative sources of power (rather than
their own engines) to power while idled. Regulation may also be necessary.



Implement incentive programs needed to increase capture of inbound and outbound
freight within Oregon ports’ and airports market service areas, thereby maximizing the
use of the most efficient modes of freight movement.



Engage the private sector to determine what shippers are already doing or are looking into
resulting in positive emission results and identify those innovations that Oregon could help
with implementation support (e.g. shipping practices, vehicle design/aerodynamics, etc.).

Reducing emissions from freight transportation is one area which can benefit from both public and
private sector innovation. This combination can also result in benefits in other areas such as safety,
reduced infrastructure and operational costs, and reduced conflict between land uses.
In
Columbus, OH, for example industry, government, and higher education as part of a larger strategy
to attract the logistics industry are working to develop green logistics solutions and practices. The
primary attraction for these private‐sector developments is cost savings, yet they reduce the impact
of freight movement. The following examples illustrate the potential:



In 2009 Wal‐Mart implemented a low‐packaging strategy to reduce the packaging around
many of the products they sell. By doing so they were able to ship more freight on the same
truck or rail car than they did before. By the end of 2009, they had increased the number of
cases of products shipped by 161 million, yet reduced VMT 87 million miles and gas
consumption 15 million gallons.



Boeing’s most recent improvement to its 747 freighter has resulted in a reduction in fuel
consumption of 17% per metric ton of cargo and about a 20% reduction in carbon emissions
all while carrying 16% more cargo. Alaska Airline is testing bio‐jet fuel that significantly
reduces emissions.

Knowing and understanding where research and development in logistics practices, equipment
manufacturing, and other areas is making advances can shape future policy and programs. Oregon,
through policy, its research universities, and partnerships with the freight community can advance
the state of the practice and encourage competition and innovation.

7. Embed Climate Change in Transportation Planning
Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 42



Embed greenhouse gas mitigation and climate change adaptation goals into least cost
transportation and land use planning conducted by state, regional and local governments.
From the overarching Oregon Transportation Plan developed by ODOT to the local comprehensive
plans and transportation system plans developed by cities and counties, all levels of government
must plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to climate change, and prepare for the
inevitable escalation in the cost of petroleum fuels.
State, regional and local governments must align spending programs to support transportation
investments that result in reduced GHGs and/or help communities adapt to climate change with the
least cost plans. We recommend that:



ODOT develop and deploy a Least Cost Planning (LCP) model for state and local government
transportation decision‐making pursuant to House Bill 2001. A robust LCP model, adapted
from electric utility LCP, would take a comprehensive approach to solving transportation
problems along the sustainability triple‐bottom‐line of the economy, the environment, and
social equity. It should consider how to affect transportation demand as well as
transportation supply. It considers all direct and indirect costs on a lifecycle basis. “Cost”
should include not only the up‐front price of an option, but also costs that can be quantified
(like congestion and GHG emissions) and costs that are qualitative in nature (like equity). It
should compare the benefits and costs of a variety of solutions and ranks them according to
cost‐effectiveness or benefit/cost ratios. It ensures that solving one transportation problem
doesn’t exacerbate another transportation problem. Oregon’s LCP model should
incorporate GHGs as a hard constraint; in other words, when applying LCP, GHGs must not
exceed a specific emissions level related to metropolitan area or statewide GHG reduction
targets.



LCDC incorporate GHG reduction goals into the Statewide Land Use Planning Goals and align
existing VMT reduction requirements with GHG reduction goals.



LCDC and DLCD develop and incorporate climate change adaptation risk assessment and
planning and Statewide Land Use Planning Goals.



ODOT incorporate GHG reduction goals and strategies to meet those goals into all modal
plans (Oregon Highway Plan, Oregon Rail Plan, etc.) as they are updated, utilizing the
statewide strategy for reducing GHG emissions from transportation sector being developed
pursuant to Senate Bill 1059.



Local governments, MPOs, and the State work cooperatively, as financing is available, to
develop, adopt and implement scenarios to achieve their transportation‐related GHG
targets, using strategies that best fit their communities. This would occur once ODOT and
DLCD have completed their Senate Bill 1059 10 requirements to develop a statewide strategy
to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, set targets for reduction of GHG

10 ODOT and DLCD are currently working with local governments, agencies and stakeholders to develop a

Statewide Strategy for Transportation for Oregon, as required by SB 1059. The strategy will serve as a
foundation for LCDC's rulemaking on GHG targets for light duty vehicles within MPO areas. Technical and
policy committees were formed or are being formed to advise OTC and LCDC on the strategy and rulemaking.
The recommendations in this report are not intended to conflict with the outcome of that effort; rather the
intent is to enrich it.

emissions from light vehicle travel for the state’s six major metropolitan areas, develop
guidelines for scenario planning, develop a toolkit to assist local governments in reducing
GHGs from transportation, develop rules for Complete Community Planning, and educate
the public about the costs and benefits of reducing transportation‐related GHG emissions.



Utilize newly developed GHG accounting and reporting methods, which include lifecycle
carbon emissions (i.e. construction energy), operations (vehicle miles traveled and flow) and
maintenance, in all planning efforts.

8. Expand Intercity Transportation Options/Choice
Provide efficient and reliable intercity transit, with higher‐speed rail as a central component.
Passenger rail and other fast, reliable intercity options are essential components of a low‐carbon
transportation future. We recommend that the state:


Pursue its near‐term plan (by 2017) to increase train speeds between Eugene and
Vancouver, BC to 110 mph, improve on‐time performance to 95 percent, pave the way for
additional daily roundtrips to be added in the future, and consider switching to electric
power for the route, potentially using solar panels on the state‐owned right‐of‐way to help
provide the electricity. These improvements could triple ridership on the Eugene to Portland
segment reducing the state’s CO2 emissions by nearly 70,000 pounds a year 11 and laying the
groundwork for eventual high‐speed service.



Explore other opportunities for commuter rail and long‐distance passenger rail.



Link Oregon communities not served by passenger rail via intercity bus service.



Build stations in the right places, where passengers have access to a variety of
transportation options for completing their trip and where passenger rail can provide a
catalyst for transit‐oriented development.

Passenger rail travel currently emits 60 percent less CO2 per passenger mile then cars and 66
percent less than planes. 12 Newer locomotives are becoming even more efficient, and switching rail
lines from diesel to electric power could reduce GHG emissions even further. We need to think
big—imagine all major U.S. cities within 100 to 500 miles of each other linked by true high‐speed
rail by mid‐century. Here in the Pacific Northwest, the Amtrak Cascades line between Eugene,
Portland, Seattle and Vancouver, B.C.—which is less than 500 miles from end to end and where
ridership has increased eight‐fold over the past 15 years—is particularly ripe for substantial
investment. While this corridor should be the initial focus of our high‐speed rail efforts, other
corridors can be served by lower‐speed passenger and commuter rail; and all communities not
served by rail must be linked with frequent and reliable intercity bus service.

9. Reduce Demand by Increasing Options
Implement cost‐effective Transportation Demand Management (TDM) programs that increase
use of travel options. TDM is a quick, inexpensive approach to reducing the number and length
of drive‐alone trips.
Nationwide, agencies have been successful at reducing drive‐alone trips by adopting demand
reduction targets, then implementing community‐appropriate strategies to achieve the target. But
Oregon currently lacks statewide and regional TDM strategies with clear goals, roles and funding.
An effective TDM program would:



Reward ODOT, MPOs, cities, counties and transit agencies that establish 2020 Demand
Reduction targets and implement strategies to achieve the targets.



Develop and market a new Statewide Rideshare Online program, a tri‐state advanced
ridesharing program for personal and commercial car sharing. Involve private sector and
marketing experts in the development. Offer incentives for participation.



Develop and implement “Corridor TDM” programs in large new transportation construction
projects.
ODOT, local agencies and employers collaboratively provide corridor users
information and incentives to carpool, vanpool, use transit, walk, bicycle and telecommute.
Similar programs have proven effective, reducing drive alone trips 8 – 13%.



Provide baseline funding for TDM programs in jurisdictions with major employers and
ongoing congestion programs, similar to WSDOT’s successful Commute Trip Reduction (CTR)
program.



Provide incentive funds for a competitive, performance‐based TDM program, open to local
agencies and private sector employers and entrepreneurs who prove measurable trip
reduction, similar to WSDOT’s successful Trip Reduction Performance Program.



Reduce or eliminate government‐supported parking subsidies.



Reward local agencies that implement Transportation Management Plan (TMP) standards
for large and mid‐sized new development projects. Developers and/or project owners
provide employees and residents information and incentives to use travel options.



Expand the use of local transportation management associations and parking management
districts to coordinate TDM and parking programs.



Support companies in setting up and marketing Peer‐to‐Peer (P2P) car sharing. P2P car
sharing enables owners of underutilized vehicles to add their cars into a P2P network during
certain hours for other members to use for an hourly rate. Example companies include
relayrides.com and spride.com.

10. Manage and Price Parking
Encourage less single‐occupancy vehicle travel and less travel during peak periods by
implementing one or more parking management strategies.

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 45



We recommend the following:



Charging for parking.



Modifying existing parking charges by eliminating discounts for daily or monthly parking,
structuring parking fees to reflect peak period use, and/or setting hourly rates higher once a
certain number of hours have passed.



Requiring employers to offer employees a “parking cash‐out” option where the employee
can choose the parking benefit or the cash equivalent of the benefit.



Impose a business license tax based on the number of parking spaces a business makes
available for employees and the public to encourage more efficient use of land.



Develop Shared Parking policies and practices.

99% of automobile trips end in a free parking spot. But neither land nor pavement are free, and the
availability of free or heavily subsidized parking encourages driving. When designed in conjunction
with other land use and pricing measures, parking pricing policies and parking management policies
can ensure the appropriate supply of parking for a given area while encouraging carpooling and
trips by other modes. Studies conducted by the USEPA of various employee parking programs found
a 12‐39% reduction in vehicle miles traveled and a 66‐81% reduction in single occupancy vehicle
trips to worksites. Similarly, the studies found community‐wide pricing programs resulted in a 19‐
31% reduction in vehicle trips. 13

11. Support Electric Vehicles
Deploy an Oregon Electric Vehicle (EV) Strategy designed to double the 2020 National level
(estimated at 5% of total fleet) of light duty vehicles registered in Oregon qualifying as electric or
plug‐in electric vehicles. 14
Accomplish this through:



Creation of a new Transportation Electrification Tax Credit (TETC) for electric vehicles and
infrastructure, as recommended by the 2010 Working Group (Governor's Alternative Fuels
Advisory Committee).



Incentives such as tax credits and feebates for EV purchases including freight vehicles.



Tax credits and other incentives to fund EV charging stations and infrastructure in
residences, work places, and public places.



Incentives for and investments in electric vehicle fleet purchases and set EV purchase
standards for government fleets.



Redesign urban streets to accommodate and encourage deployment of low‐speed electric
vehicles (including two and three‐wheeled EVs).

13 US EPA (1997) "Opportunities to Improve Air Quality through Transportation Pricing Programs
14

The EC‐Vehicle Electrification Roadmap, published in 2010, projected a 5% by 2020 national target.

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020

Page 46





Deployment of smart grid technology for EV charging by 2020 to significantly reduce the
need for utility infrastructure upgrades.

Use of electricity for powering vehicles will reduce harmful emissions and promote sustainable
mobility. In Oregon, our electricity partly comes from renewable sources but also coal and natural
gas. Nonetheless, powering vehicles with electricity produced from any of our energy sources is
more efficient than using gasoline powered engines. According to the US Department of Energy,
electric motors convert 75 percent of the chemical energy from the batteries to power the wheels,
while internal combustion engines (ICEs) only convert 15 to 20 percent. Even with energy losses at
the power plants and through transmission, electric vehicles are producing considerably less GHG
emissions than internal combustion engines. As the percentage of renewable energy sources
increases, the benefits of electric vehicles will also increase.
While EVs are a substantial improvement over internal combustion engines, driving EVs in the next
decade is not a “cure‐all” and will still contribute to GHG emissions; therefore, promotion of EVs
needs to be integrated with other strategies to most efficiently meet GHG targets.

12. Adopt Low‐Carbon Fuel Standard
Ensure an Oregon low‐carbon fuels market through adoption of a low‐carbon fuel standard and
local production of sustainable biofuels.
The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is currently undertaking rulemaking to adopt a
low carbon fuel standard. The low‐carbon fuel standard will require providers of transportation
fuels to reduce the carbon intensity of the fuel mix they deliver to Oregon by at least 10% by 2020.
This will grow Oregon’s clean energy industry, from electric vehicle manufacturing to cellulosic
biofuels; discourage unclean energy investments, such as fuel from coal‐to‐liquids and oil produced
from tar sands and oil shale; reduce Oregon’s dependence on imported oil, keeping more money in
the state; and reduce the sensitivity of Oregon’s economy to oil price uncertainty and shocks
resulting from refinery outages, cartel actions or disruptions in world oil supplies. The rules will
apply only to major transportation fuels, allow for a phased‐in schedule, provide quality assurance,
and allow deferrals and exemptions as necessary to ensure adequate fuel supplies.



The DEQ rulemaking needs to be completed with accurate GHG intensity methodologies
that reduce life‐cycle carbon impacts of Oregon’s fuels.



Current statutory authority expires in 2015; this “sunset” needs to be removed so that long‐
term market stability encourages investments in fueling, vehicles, and local fuel production.



Companion actions are needed to increase state and local support for building in‐state fuel
production and processing infrastructure, which studies indicate will have major benefits for
rural Oregon economies.

Oregon’s overwhelming dependence on petroleum as a single feedstock for its transportation fuels
leads to volatility in prices and high GHG intensities throughout the transportation sector. One
essential component for Oregon to reduce its GHG emissions in the transportation sector is to
reduce the GHG intensity of transportation fuels. Providing diversity in sources of transportation
Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 47



fuels will reduce the volatility in prices, increase new economic opportunities for the development
of in‐state production of liquid fuels, and do this while reducing GHG emissions statewide.
A low‐carbon fuel standard requires all providers of transportation fuels to meet a declining
standard for GHG‐intensity of its fuels. HB 2186, passed by the 2009 Legislature, established these
requirements in Oregon through 2015. The Department of Environmental Quality is developing the
rules to implement the market mechanisms that will allow complying entities to most cost‐
effectively meet the GHG intensity reductions of the fuels they sell. Innovations in biofuels, and
emerging replacement fuels, such as electricity to power electric vehicles, will likely play a major
role in the state’s effort to meet these important standards.

Land within Oregon is considered a finite resource
and must serve future generations. In addition to
urban needs, the State’s lands must serve
agricultural, forest, and natural habitat purposes.
Therefore, with limited exceptions (i.e. allowing
flexibility within UGBs without modifying total
urban land supply), we must accommodate
residential and employment growth within existing
urban growth boundaries by focusing new
development on vacant developable land or
through infill and redevelopment. This requirement
would take effect after December 2012 and
exceptions should only be approved for specific
uses that cannot be accommodated within an
existing UGB or for growth that accommodates
integrated transportation and land use planning for
complete communities.
Objectives would focus on land conservation and
include:
Strategies to better balance housing and
employment within UGBs in order to minimize
expansion of urban “travel sheds.”
Brownfield redevelopment. While difficult, efforts
to minimize urban footprints by cleaning up and
reusing large parcels of mostly vacant land should
be accelerated, partnerships fostered, and
incentives developed.
Transit Oriented Developments to better leverage
mixed‐use high‐density development with transit
investments.

Better link leisure and recreation opportunities with
transit, walking, and biking.

B. Non‐motorized Transportation
Bicycling –related Strategies:
Create pedestrian & bicycle master plans and
expand and improve pedestrian & bicycle
infrastructure and connectivity. These
improvements should include increasing the
mileage of bicycle boulevards and shared‐use paths
to accommodate bicyclists of varying abilities.

16

Require a minimum amount of long‐term bicycle
parking spaces for multi‐dwelling development in
areas other than the dwelling unit.
M

Require the development and implementation of
“Complete Community Plans” for all urban areas
that are subject to Comprehensive Planning in the
State of Oregon (cities over 10,000).
“Complete Community Plans” (e.g. 20 minute
neighborhoods) are intended to meet local
aspirations for creating and maintaining livable,
vibrant communities that can accommodate a
majority of non‐work trips via walking, biking,
shared rides, and, where available, public
transportation. Complete community plans should
include, but not be limited to:

17

Higher density, mixed‐use zoning and development
incentives aligned with public transit and a
connected system of “complete” streets that
include pedestrian amenities and bicycle facilities
(bike boulevards, lanes, parking).

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 55



Parking management plans that limit parking in
order to allow more efficient use of land and to
balance parking supply with actual demand.
Land use plans that identify a development and
implementation strategy of key community
amenities to fit local aspirations for shopping,
parks, schools, libraries, public plazas, farmers
markets, and other places for people to congregate
and meet everyday needs.
Housing plans that balance housing needs for all
income levels and housing types and leverage
access to public transit, walking, and bicycles.

18

Create pedestrian districts where only a very limited
vehicle traffic is allowed in Central Business Districts
and neighborhoods. These could be permanent or
implemented at regular intervals.

C. Public Transportation
Provide efficient and reliable intercity transit, with
higher‐speed rail as a central component.
Passenger rail and other fast, reliable intercity
options are essential components of a low‐carbon
transportation future. We recommend that the
state:

19

Pursue its near‐term plan (by 2017) to increase train
speeds between Eugene and Vancouver, BC to 110
mph, improve on‐time performance to 95 percent,
pave the way for additional daily roundtrips to be
added in the future, and consider switching to
electric power for the route, potentially using solar

panels on the state‐owned right‐of‐way to help
provide the electricity. These improvements could
triple ridership on the Eugene to Portland segment
reducing the state’s CO2 emissions by nearly 70,000
pounds a year 15 and laying the groundwork for
eventual high‐speed service.
Explore other opportunities for commuter rail and
long‐distance passenger rail.
Link Oregon communities not served by passenger
rail via intercity bus service.
Build stations in the right places, where passengers
have access to a variety of transportation options
for completing their trip and where passenger rail
can provide a catalyst for transit‐oriented
development.
Provide efficient and reliable intercity transit, with

D. Transportation Demand Management

Implement cost‐effective Transportation
Demand Management (TDM) programs that
increase use of travel options.
Reward ODOT, MPOs, cities, counties and transit
agencies that establish 2020 Demand Reduction
targets and implement strategies to achieve the
targets.

development. Offer incentives for participation.
Develop and implement “Corridor TDM” programs
in large new transportation construction projects.
ODOT, local agencies and employers collaboratively
provide corridor users information and incentives
to carpool, vanpool, use transit, walk, bicycle and
telecommute. Similar programs have proven
effective, reducing drive alone trips 8 – 13%.
Provide baseline funding for TDM programs in
jurisdictions with major employers and ongoing
congestion programs, similar to WSDOT’s successful
Commute Trip Reduction (CTR) program.
Provide incentive funds for a competitive,
performance‐based TDM program, open to local
agencies and private sector employers and
entrepreneurs who prove measurable trip
reduction, similar to WSDOT’s successful Trip
Reduction Performance Program.
Reduce or eliminate government‐supported parking
subsidies.
Reward local agencies that implement
Transportation Management Plan (TMP) standards
for large and mid‐sized new development projects.
Developers and/or project owners provide
employees and residents information and
incentives to use travel options.
Expand the use of local transportation management
associations and parking management districts to
coordinate TDM and parking programs.
Support companies in setting up and marketing

Invest in carpool vans and park and ride sites.
Support investments to provide high‐performance
broadband connectivity to every business and
residence to enable widespread e‐commerce,
telecommuting and improved emergency response.

E. Pricing and Unbundling Fixed Costs
Encourage less single‐occupancy vehicle travel and
less travel during peak periods by implementing
one or more parking management strategies.
Charging for parking.
Modifying existing parking charges by eliminating
discounts for daily or monthly parking, structuring
parking fees to reflect peak period use, and/or
setting hourly rates higher once a certain number of
hours have passed.

Develop Shared Parking policies and practices.

26

Support federal tax credits for insurance companies
that offer a pay‐as‐you‐drive insurance product to
supplement Oregon’s tax credit. Court MileMeter,
an insurance company in Texas that is offering a
pay‐as‐you‐drive insurance product.

27

Develop a location‐efficient mortgage program to
help families buy houses close to where they work.

28

Require developers to pay impact fees to help cover
the cost of infrastructure improvements.

IV. Move Goods Efficiently
A. Freight Movement
Reduce carbon emissions from freight movement
in Oregon and help improve the efficiency and cost‐
effectiveness of freight movement.
Improve tools and transparency to accurately show
how freight moves through the system in order to
improve efficiency of freight movement and
infrastructure investment. This includes the
development and deployment of Intelligent
Transportation System (ITS) elements to inform
drivers of existing conditions and route alternatives
as well as the collection and sharing of truck trip
routing data to identify where operational or
infrastructural inefficiencies exist.

29

Make strategic investments in multi‐modal freight
transportation, including intermodal freight
transshipment facilities as well as infrastructure
capacity to enable cost‐effective mode shifting over
time from less carbon‐efficient modes (e.g., truck,

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 61



air) to more carbon‐efficient modes (e.g., rail) for
medium and long‐haul freight movement. Ensure
such investments are commensurate with and
result in an identifiable public benefit (consistent
with Least Cost Planning principles) and leverage
private investments where possible.
Site industrial land/facilities along key freight
corridors and interchanges, and support and
conserve regional significant industrial areas that
may provide for future intermodal facilities and
efficient local deliveries.
Implement market‐based incentive programs to
incent truck and rail fleets to switch to more
efficient engines and fuel types and to adopt
alternative sources of power (rather than their own
engines) to power while idled. Regulation may also
be necessary.
Implement incentive programs needed to increase
capture of inbound and outbound freight within
Oregon ports’ and airports market service areas,
thereby maximizing the use of the most efficient
modes of freight movement.
Engage the private sector to determine what
shippers are already doing or are looking into
resulting in positive emission results and identify
those innovations that Oregon could help with
implementation support (e.g. shipping practices,
vehicle design/aerodynamics, etc.).

30

Increase the number of trucks participating in
"Green Light" (weigh‐in‐motion) program.

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020

31

Review transponder and WIM requirements in CA
and WA. Implement consistent equipment
requirements along West coast.

32

Develop new goals and strategies for efficient goods
movement, including working with ports to adopt
“green ports” goals.

B. Vehicle Technology
Accelerate EPA regulations on diesel emissions from
ships.

33

Set and meet goals for reduced diesel consumption
by ships at port by providing shore power.

34

Design and maintain commercial harbor crafts (i.e.
tugboats) to maximum efficiency.

35

Remove Transport Refrigeration Units Cold Storage
prohibition and to increase energy efficiency

C. Vehicle Operations
36

Educate vessel operators about most fuel‐efficient
speeds to operate at.

V. Optimize Vehicle Flow and Operations
A. Transportation System Management and Operations
Provide real‐time information to drivers on optimal
route and parking options utilizing Intelligent
Transportation Systems. (i.e. –iPod apps, etc,]

37

Utilize best practices including congestion pricing to
optimize traffic flow for travel time, fuel efficiency,
and GHG performance. Include speed limits, signal
timing and other intelligent transportation system
(ITS) solutions.

Reduce the speed limit on interstates and highways.

VI. Enhance Decision Making
A. Decision Making Framework

40

Include transportation emissions in any “cap‐and‐
trade” or carbon tax mechanisms developed at a
national, regional or state level.
Embed greenhouse gas mitigation and climate
change adaptation goals into least cost
transportation and land use planning conducted by
state, regional and local governments.

41

ODOT develop and deploy a Least Cost Planning
(LCP) model for state and local government
transportation decision‐making pursuant to House
Bill 2001. A robust LCP model, adapted from electric
utility LCP, would take a comprehensive approach
to solving transportation problems along the
sustainability triple‐bottom‐line of the economy,
the environment, and social equity. It should
consider how to affect transportation demand as
well as transportation supply. It considers all direct
and indirect costs on a lifecycle basis. “Cost” should
include not only the up‐front price of an option, but
also costs that can be quantified (like congestion
and GHG emissions) and costs that are qualitative in
nature (like equity). It should compare the benefits
and costs of a variety of solutions and ranks them
according to cost‐effectiveness or benefit/cost

Oregon Global Warming Commission T&LU Roadmap to 2020
T&LU Technical Committee

Page 64



ratios. It ensures that solving one transportation
problem doesn’t exacerbate another transportation
problem. Oregon’s LCP model should incorporate
GHGs as a hard constraint; in other words, when
applying LCP, GHGs must not exceed a specific
emissions level related to metropolitan area or
statewide GHG reduction targets.
LCDC incorporate GHG reduction goals into the
Statewide Land Use Planning Goals and align
existing VMT reduction requirements with GHG
reduction goals.
LCDC and DLCD develop and incorporate climate
change adaptation risk assessment and planning
into the Statewide Land Use Planning Goals.
ODOT incorporate GHG reduction goals and
strategies to meet those goals into all modal plans
(Oregon Highway Plan, Oregon Rail Plan, etc.) as
they are updated, utilizing the statewide strategy
for reducing GHG emissions from transportation
sector being developed pursuant to Senate Bill
1059.
Local governments, MPOs, and the State work
cooperatively, as financing is available, to develop,
adopt and implement scenarios to achieve their
transportation‐related GHG targets, using strategies
that best fit their communities. This would occur
once ODOT and DLCD have completed their Senate
Bill 1059 requirements to develop a statewide
strategy to reduce GHG emissions from the

C. Funding
As discussed in action #53 below, the state should
adopt a “utility” methodology for assessing and
charging Oregonians according to their efficient use
of the transportation system.
The T&LU Technical Committee did not fully explore
the viability or revenue‐raising potential of all
possible new sources of funding; however, the
following have been identified as options in need of
future exploration by the T&LU Technical
Committee, the Global Warming Commission, the
Governor and Legislature, and others:
Maximizing the use of all discretionary funds (e.g.
federal funds for multimodal transportation).
Offering drivers the opportunity to make a
voluntary contribution to an alternative
transportation fund to offset the impact of their
driving behavior when they renew their vehicle
registration or driver’s license.

use any part of the system, whether driving, biking,
busing, or using goods and services delivered from
the system;
An (“energy”) “usage” based charge (i.e. VMT
charge) to reflect the amount one uses the system,
that includes both the cost of infrastructure and
externalities (e.g., airshed pollutant contribution;
carbon emissions);
A (“peak”) “congestion” based charge to reflect
peak period use of the system.

Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Report to the Oregon Global Warming Commission
The following report, Oregon Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020, was developed by the
Industrial Technical Committee of the Oregon Global Warming Commission (OGWC).
Technical Committee members are listed in Appendix A of this report.

I. PURPOSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The Industrial Technical Committee of the Oregon Global Warming Commission is to
identify technologies, practices and policies required to contribute to meeting Oregon’s
greenhouse gas emission (GhG) reductions of 10% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 75%
below 1990 levels by 2050. The committee’s short duration did not allow for a more
comprehensive development of a roadmap. Next steps recommended include:
establishing intermediary goals, timeline, prioritization of strategies based on impact
(emission reductions), implementation strategies, identification of implementing
parties, establish follow up date to report progress. It is further recommended that
environmental interests be represented on subsequent industrial committees.
The recommendations in this report will be considered by the Oregon Global Warming
Commission for inclusion in the Interim Roadmap to 2020/Report to the new Governor
and Legislature, to state agencies, and to Oregon’s Congressional delegation.
Recommendations may also guide private sector investments and university research
agendas.
A summary of the key recommendations is below with a more detailed discussion in
Section III. Key Actions for 2020:
1.

4.

Accelerate use of energy efficient technology and practice.
Establish GhG leadership recognition program.
Improve access to financing and incentives.
Build human capacity to innovate and execute industry process improvements.

Background
In 2005, Oregon industrial greenhouse gas emissions of 19.96 million metric tons
represented 27% of all Oregon emissions in carbon dioxide equivalents. Those
emissions include direct combustion, electricity consumption, industrial processes,
methane from wastewater, nitrous oxide from waste incineration, high global warming
potential gasses such as ozone‐depleting substance substitutes and other CO2
equivalent emissions from semiconductor and other manufacturing processes. The two
largest categories are 1) direct combustion of petroleum and natural gas and 2)

Industrial Technical Committee

Page 70



consumption of electricity. These two categories totaled 13.2 MMTCO2e in 2005,
roughly 66% of industrial emissions. In 1990, overall emissions were 16.3 MMTCO2e.
Reduction to 10% below 1990 levels by 2020 will require a 27% reduction of 5.3
MMTCO2e from the 2005 emissions level of 19.96 MMTCO2e.

Reduction of overall Oregon industry emissions to 75% below 1990 levels by 2050
would result in a reduction of 15.9 MMTCO2e or total industry emissions of 4.06
MMTCO2e, which is the equivalent of more than half the emissions from direct
combustion alone. Discussion with industry indicates that reduction of emission
intensity per unit of production provides a manageable metric, encourages dramatic
improvement, and addresses site or commodity specific processes, while positioning
Oregon industry to compete globally based on environmental attributes.
Metrics of MMTCO2e intensity per unit of product from all Oregon industrial processes
are not entirely known at this time. MMTCO2e benchmarking in industry, by unit of
production, is nascent. Northwest Food Processors Association (NWFPA) has begun
benchmarking products for energy intensity and MMTCO2e , with product energy
intensity as the metric for a commitment to its industry‐wide energy reduction efforts.

II. FUTURE STATEMENTS
In order to guide the recommendations, the group defined what the state of industry
could be in 2020 and 2050 if Oregon Greenhouse goals were met. The following are
visions and projections of the future for such a case.

Industrial Practices in 2050
Oregon industry is a zero waste, zero defect and 100% on‐time producer of the most
globally advanced products and industry services which have the lowest energy and
raw materials intensity on the planet. For those reasons, Oregon industry products are
sought‐ after worldwide. Comprehensive industry enterprise management systems
enable production whereby each product is labeled with its carbon and all materials
content from raw material extraction through delivery to the end‐user. GhG emissions
from natural gas and petroleum combustion, semiconductor manufacturing gasses,
cement manufacturing, iron and steel processes, ammonia and urea production, and
other industrial emissions, in intensity per unit of production, is 75% of 1990 levels.
Continuous improvement management is measured in real‐time, on a commodity‐by‐
commodity basis, in all industry with quality and safety control fully integrated.

Industrial Practices in 2020
In 2020 Oregon industry is a national leader in applying and sharing best practices in
energy efficiency, waste reduction and by‐product utilization. In 2020, primary GhG
emission reductions are being accomplished through stringent management, upgrade
and replacement of direct natural gas using equipment. Other emissions reductions
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 72



strategies from substitutes for greenhouse gas depleting refrigeration gases and
process gasses are being developed. Lean manufacturing processes are being
implemented and reduce overall energy use per unit of production.
The marketplace in 2020 shows substantial progress towards addressing these market
barriers. The following conditions are accelerating industries GhG reductions. Industry
is sharing best practices in ways that do not threaten their competitiveness. Third
parties are vetting technologies and identifying successful applications with thorough
case studies, workshops and technology transfer forums readily available to industry.
Industry confidence in vetted technologies is high and the characteristics of plant
specific applications are readily understood and communicated. Industry sectors are
collaborating on technology and practice applications.
Industry and product
benchmarking and metrics are being used at Oregon facilities using national level data
to provide more efficacy, and broader data sets. Industries are setting energy and GhG
goals to compete nationally and internationally. The state and other third parties are
providing recognition and promotion of industries in the upper twentieth percentile
performance on GHG emissions and energy use per unit of production. Additional
capital inside and outside industry is pursuing investment in cost effective energy
savings and GhG emissions reductions. Industry is realizing lower cost of production
from efforts and gaining competitive advantage. The education and training available
to industry is providing them with a world‐class workforce fully prepared to implement
continuous improvements in GhG emissions reductions, lean manufacturing, energy
savings and renewable resource use. Higher education, industry associations and utility
efficiency advocacy organizations provide a coordinated and complimentary array of
efficiency training opportunities. Successful models of business co‐location for energy
systems operations, energy savings performance contracts, thermal energy sharing and
combined heat an power operations exist and are details of that success are available
for industry consideration.

III. KEY ACTIONS FOR 2020
To accomplish GhG reductions of 10% by 2020 requires a 27% reduction from 2005
emissions levels. To accomplish this the following actions must be taken to accelerate
industry use of efficient technology and practices, align and motivate industry
leadership around greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals, improvement needs to be
made in streamlining and providing additional access to financing and incentives.
Water use is an important component of the energy use of many industrial processes,
and increases in water efficiency should also be part of the greenhouse gas emissions
reduction strategy. Attention must be paid to development of the industrial workforce
are required to assure the capacity to lead substantive industry process change.
The following actions need to be implemented immediately to even meet the 2020 goal.
It is believed these actions provide the supportive framework necessary for industry to
accomplish GhG emissions reductions through voluntary participation. These actions
will provide additional employment, reduce industry waste, improve their productivity
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 73



and improve their competitiveness. Achieving GhG reductions to 10% below 1990
levels by 2020 will require eliminating some 5.3 million metric tons of GhG emissions
from Oregon industry per year. That is a 27% reduction in industrial emissions from
2005 levels!
Note: More details for each of the actions below are discussed in more detail in Appendix
B.

1. Accelerate use of energy efficient technology and practice
Energy efficiency in boilers, thermal systems, motors and drives, refrigeration, air
compression, lighting, materials handling and best design, operations and maintenance
practices are not in widespread use in industry. The Northwest Power and
Conservation Council identified in their Sixth Power Plan some 700 average megawatts
of cost‐effective known electric energy savings potential in Oregon. An estimated 200
average megawatts of that potential is in industry. The Energy Trust of Oregon is on
track to accomplish nearly half or 300 average megawatts of that potential over the next
decade, but from all market sectors including residential, commercial, industrial and
new construction. Additional services and resources and approaches are called for to
directly target Oregon’s large industrial facilities and Oregon’s other large greenhouse
gas emitters such as universities and hospitals. Natural gas energy savings technologies
in boiler systems and many direct use thermal improvements are known and proven.
The Energy Trust of Oregon has accomplished 21 million therms per year of natural gas
savings through their efficiency programs to date. However, most of those savings can
be attributed to commercial uses. Oregon’s industrial energy efficiency service
programs for natural gas focus on utility purchasers of natural gas while a larger
proportion of industrial natural gas is purchased through pipeline contracts and not
subject to public purpose charge incentives or organized services. This larger source of
GhG emissions needs to be addressed through development of GhG metrics by industry,
services and expertise from higher education, and focusing incentives, resources and
financing options on these large GhG emissions. A comprehensive combined heat and
power initiative has not been delivered in Oregon and evaluation, planning and
implementation of one will result in significant reductions of GhG in Oregon’s largest
industries.



Implement an aggressive boiler and direct natural gas efficiency initiative
targeting industry.



Provide additional cross‐cutting industry efficiency training, analysis and
implementation technical assistance.



Provide support for distributed generation; Assess and initiate industry wide
combined heat and power evaluations and support investment, assess and
initiate industry wide distributed renewable generation scoping studies and
investment.

2. Establish GhG leadership recognition program
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 74



Focused and deliberate planning and implementation of GhG reduction strategies needs
to be understood as value‐added by industry leadership. Recognition and “branding’ of
early commitment to effective GhG reduction needs to support that understanding,
commitment and progress. Oregon has not historically engaged, nor fully supported,
industry sectors to share best practices, identify benchmarks or determine the needed
services to accomplish meaningful and valuable GhG reductions though energy
efficiency and other measures. The Northwest Food Processors Association has begun
to provide the planning, services and recognition to their members who have formally
adopted energy intensity reduction goals. That effort is proving results and the lessons
learned will benefit other industry sectors. Implementation of an industry “Leaders“
program (detailed in Appendix C) will be essential to the success of these actions. The
committee believes an industry “leaders” approach will be critical to the success of any
regulatory accomplishment of Oregon industry GhG reductions as well, should they be
considered. Recognition for industries that are successful and on track with GhG
intensity or overall reductions will be essential as well. National and international
expert assistance with the planning, initiation and implementation of industry sector
(pulp and paper, wood products, steel, microelectronics, chemicals, metals casting)
goals, plans, benchmarks (metrics) and practices needs to be coordinated and facilitated
with industry leader participation.



Create a Recognition, branding and marketing “Oregon Top Twentieth” or
“Leaders” program that includes primary industry and the services. Integrate
into Oregon marketing programs (see Appendix C).



Assign state government to focus goals and action implementation on the top
nine emissions and top ten industry sectors.

3. Improve access to financing and incentives
Oregon financing and incentives have not directly targeted GhG emissions reductions.
Energy efficiency and renewable resource incentives and finance have resulted in GhG
reductions. Oregon’s largest industrial natural gas uses are not eligible for public
purpose charge incentives or services. Access to GhG specific incentives and financing
will help industry to set goals for reductions while providing ready, assured, fixed rate
and terms finance. Coupled with focused cross‐cutting technology knowledge, service
and implementation assistance, bond backed financing of industrial GhG reduction
efforts will improve industry profitability, provide employment and sustain
accomplishment of industry GhG emissions reductions.




Maintain and expand state incentives and financing that target industry GHG.




Increase Energy Trust of Oregon (ETO) initiatives for industry.

Review, evaluate and adopt the most effective emerging or innovative funding
mechanisms, particularly those that leverage private dollars
Encourage congressional delegation to expedite energy legislation with
expansion of investment tax credit to GHG.

4. Build human capacity to innovate and execute industry process
improvements
Perhaps the most significant opportunity to reduce Oregon industry GhG emissions and
improve their global competitiveness is through significant changes in industry
processes. Facilitated by USDOE, the pulp and paper, steel, wood, products,
biotechnology and microelectronics industries have partnered to identify fundamental
changes in materials transformation (see Appendix B. for examples) and production
resulting in substantial energy savings and GhG reduction. These changes are essential
for industry to begin to address the challenges of meeting the 2050 goal of 75% GhG
reduction from 1990 levels. Engaging higher education in providing technical
assistance to Oregon’s industries will both provide needed services now and prepare
the future workforce for the daunting task(s) of implementing these fundamental
changes. Drawing upon national “Roadmaps” for specific industries, engaging the
national laboratories and using all possible federal resources (Commerce, Energy and
Environmental Protection) will require planning, concerted human resources,
curriculum emphasis and further technology research and application. Developing the
science to where industry is confident of outcomes and supported technically in
applications will be critical.
To accomplish these actions, a planned partnership of industry, state government,
industry associations and utility efficiency advocacy groups must be developed and
effectively managed. Energy efficiency technologies and practices are believed to be
capable of providing cost effective approaches to accomplishing the 2020 reduction
goals. Substantive industrial process changes or new CO2 free energy sources will be
required for savings past that threshold to meet the 2050 objective of having all
industrial GhG emissions at 4 MMTCO2e.



Develop Oregon industry specific plans and roadmaps for 2020 and 2050.



Partner with industry to direct multi‐discipline teams from agencies and higher
education to develop a center of excellence to help industry sectors.



Build lean manufacturing practices into standard engineering programs at state
universities and community colleges.

Impacts to Oregon’s Industry
The following table estimates the possible range of investment and cost savings should
Oregon GhG reduction goals be accomplished by 2020. Emissions are shown in
millions of metric tons of C02 emission equivalents per year. Energy savings in the
natural gas direct use and industrial process category are shown in millions of therms
per year and average megawatt hours for electricity consumption. Costs are in millions
of dollars by 2020 for investments. Energy cost savings is shown in millions of dollars
per year for energy cost savings in 2020 at 2005 cost for energy.

Capital cost for implementing GhG reduction projects and practices in Oregon industry
that accomplish the 2020 goal of 10% below 1990 levels will be between $800 million
and $1.7 billion dollars. The measure cost estimates and any simple payback based on
those costs does not take into account any federal, state local or utility incentives.
Conservative energy cost savings from that reduction is expected to be at least $265
million. The range of simple rate of return on these investments is from 3 to 6.6 years.
Incentives will lower this simple payback range and improve the attractiveness of
industrial efficiency investments. The natural gas savings is a third of all industrial
natural gas use and some 18 times the annual natural gas savings implemented by the
Energy Trust of Oregon (21 million therms per year) in over a half dozen years work
with all market sectors. The electric energy savings is just over all of the potential cost‐
effective electric energy savings identified in the NW Power and Conservation Council
6th plan for Oregon industry.
Note that energy savings and costs are not shown for Methane, Nitrous Oxides and
greenhouse gas depleting gasses and their substitutes (CFC, HFC, SF4). Less is known
about the costs and reduction strategies for those emissions. In the case of Nitrous
Oxide emissions it is expected that addressing industry direct gas use and industrial
processes will result in some reduction. Even though, it is expected that the
aforementioned actions will address those emissions sources through establishment of

industry specific goals, sharing of best practices and development of Oregon specific
action plans by industry segment.
Some assumptions for consideration of these estimates include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

2,205 pounds per metric ton of emissions
11 lbs CO2 per therm of natural gas
.96 pounds of CO2 per kilowatt hour
Natural gas efficiency cost range is $1 and $3 per therm saved
Electric efficiency cost is between $1.5 million and $2 million per average
megawatt hour (8,760,000 kilowatt hours)
Natural gas cost savings assume $0.40 per therm
Electric energy cost savings assume $44 dollars a megawatt hour

There are numerous, economic, environmental and future potential benefits to Oregon
industry from accomplishment of 2020 industry GhG reduction goals. Up $1.7 billion
dollars in new capital projects will create more jobs. Over $200 million in projects will
have to be undertaken each year to meet these reduction goals at the estimated high
cost. Given that approximately one third of industrial capital investments are for labor,
we can estimate that more than $70 million per year would be spent on a technical
workforce earning more than family wage jobs. At an average of $70,000 per person
with all indirect costs included, employment could exceed 1,000 per year. Granted,
some of those jobs will be currently employed construction and technical workers that
are retained. However, this investment represents a more than threefold increase per
year in industry capital investment in efficiency and GhG reductions. Energy cost
savings to industry is very conservatively estimated at just over a quarter of a billion
dollars per year in 2020. The simple return on investment to industry is 6.6 years
without accounting for depreciation, incentives that buy down their cost or the likely
escalation of energy costs over the next nine years. A simple internal return on
investment of 15% or greater can be expected from the energy efficiency related
investments in GhG reduction which accounts for nearly 60 percent of GhG reductions
called for by industry, should we accomplish 2020 goals. The air quality improvements
from reduced direct natural gas use, reductions in other GhG’s and the indirect
reduction in emissions from electric generation will result. No estimate for the
resulting positive health impacts is determined at this time. Oregon industry reductions
in GhG will position them to be more globally competitive in future energy supply and
carbon constrained markets.

Conclusions
We call upon stakeholders, including government and elected officials, business leaders,
environmental advocates and others to work together to make our energy use as
productive and efficient as possible. We recommend that our community embrace and
implement the actions that we discuss and use this approach to meet emission
reduction goals from the industrial sector. This suite of actions provides a broader array

of services and resources specifically targeting expressed business needs. These
strategies build on recent voluntary initiatives that are making gains (e.g. NW Food
Processors).

APPENDIX D
“Leaders Program” of Industry Support and Recognition
“Leaders” program
This program would seek a long term commitment and goal from industry CEO’s and would
coordinate the long term strategy and support that will help each company reach its goal. This
program would be high profile and would include elements of public relations, marketing and
executive‐to‐executive forums to create a network of business leaders.
Resources from organizations like Oregon Department of Energy, Energy Trust of Oregon,
Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance, the Climate Trust, Climate Solutions, Northwest Food
Processors Association, Oregon Business Council, Associated Oregon Industries, Northwest Natural
Gas, US Department of Energy and others would be coordinated to develop, fund and manage the
program. A minimum of 5 years of intense assistance would be committed to participating
facilities, tied to a multi‐year plan created for each facility upon joining. Long‐term commitment by
federal, state, local and utilities to providing industry assistance is critical to assuring industry’s
active participation and progress towards GhG emissions reductions.

APPENDIX F
Industry Characteristics in 2020 and 2050
More than 90% of the carbon emissions from the Oregon industrial sector are associated with the
conversion and use of energy. The future portends a gradual restructuring of industry toward
knowledge‐intensive rather than materials/energy‐intensive products, because of improved computer
controls, gains in process efficiency, just‐in‐time manufacturing methods, more efficient conversion
and use of energy supplies, application of advanced technologies, and resource recovery and
optimized resource use.
2020

All boilers over 1 million British Thermal Units per hour capacity are maintained and tuned annually,
stack heat recovery is installed, steam trap and pressure reduction are continuously maintained and
use the best available technology. Other gas thermal systems use efficient radiant or fluidized bed
drying technologies with the highest efficiency available. A coordinated, multi agency boiler efficiency
program serves all industry throughout the state. This program coordinates resources (human and
financial), marketing, information, technical support and measurement techniques in order to very
quickly help industry reduce carbon emissions and develop research ideas in the technical area that
has the highest carbon reduction potential, boilers. The largest boiler systems are targeted and
marketed to for participation. Participants get over 100% rate of return on their investment in annual
boiler tuning. Heat recovery and steam distribution energy savings are targeted, identified, quantified
and internal business cases made for capital improvements to boilers made.
Industry associations, the ETO, NEEA and utilities regularly share best available practices through
onsite education, project implementation workshops, industry staff training and case studies. Industry
groups and higher education collaboratively develop areas of research to solve technical problems and
to develop applied solutions to industry process management and GHG reduction.
Industries across Oregon all have energy managers who have benchmarked production energy, cost
and emissions by facility and commodity. Targets are set for GHG emissions reductions in each
industry and at each facility and specific technology applications are identified by process or system.
State and local government continue to provide access to low cost capital, incentives and property tax
abatement that incent industry investment in GHG and energy reductions. Those include publically
bonded financing, income and property tax credits, regulatory streamlining for air, water and
structural permitting.
2050

Various and complimentary industry are co‐located throughout the state, optimizing use of all
feedstock’s, energy and water supply. All production residues (materials, water, chemicals, thermal…)
become feedstock for other complimentary industry. Nano‐technology conversion systems are used in
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 93



all industries to create unique products with superior qualities at low or no GHG emissions. Advanced
separation systems use ambient temperature fractionation and cellulose fiber membranes to improve
segregation, purity and use of chemicals and organics alike. Renewable energy supplies are either
extracted from feedstock materials or scheduled for use based on real‐time renewable energy supply
forecasts and production schedules for just‐in‐time, on‐time delivery at programmed costs.
Oregon institutions of higher education, and state, federal and local government provide industry
advancement support by routinely sponsoring and convening industry market segment and cross‐
cutting technology, pre‐competitive research, education, marketing and application implementation.
Education institutes directly provide applied research for continuous improvement, rapidly, toughly
and solution specific to each of Oregon’s major industry sectors. State government provides policies
that promote the use of best available practice (BAP) and technology (BAT) through workforce
readiness, research of best available practice and technology, promotion of benefits, standards setting
with achievable reach goals and education. State agencies have specific targets, and technical and
policy staff to help industry accomplish GHG intensity targets through value‐added field, policy and
regulatory services. Local government provides land use and transportation infrastructure support
that grows industry co‐location, resource sharing and integration to continually improve local industry
efficiency.
Quality. Oregon’s, paper, wood products, metals, foods, microelectronics, chemicals, membranes, non‐
metallic minerals, machinery, transportation equipment, plastics and fabricated metals and wood
products set global standards for production performance, specification tolerances, safety and
durability. Oregon commodities are known for their low or net‐zero carbon content, lean resource and
manufacturing processes, metrics for accountability and performance reliability. The methods for
accounting are transparent and published and available for adaptation by others in pre‐competitive
formats.
Energy. All natural gas, petroleum, electrical energy and renewable energy use per unit of production
is 75% of 1990 levels. Thermal energy processes in industry require half the energy they did in 1990
and are twice as thermally efficient. Thermal energy reductions result from use of ambient
temperature organic chemical catalysts, ceramic thermal management, and low vacuum forming. All
remaining thermal processes use advanced gasification, pyrolysis and Fisher‐Tropsh methods
recovering all syn‐gasses as higher added‐value commodities or energy supplies. All feedstock
materials are efficiently mined for all energy, fiber, mineral and chemical properties and the
predominant volume of feedstock comes from renewable resources. Advanced energy and resource
management telemetry enables industry to source the lowest GhG emission materials and energy
supplies in real‐time.
Technology. Full enterprise management systems optimize the use of all industry resources from raw
material to product delivery (materials, resources, human resource, energy, services, technology,
processes). Learning controls systems rewrite algorithms for systems optimization in reliable,
replicable and accountable ways. All BAT and BAP are implemented in all industry. Advanced
combustion, thermal, refrigeration, materials conversion and refining, conveyance, lean packaging, and
multimodal transportation systems are in use industry wide. Cooling towers are all but eliminated as
businesses co‐locate with industry to optimize use of any of the remaining waste heat.
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 94



Principal Emissions. Natural gas, petroleum and coal combustion emissions in 2050 are less than
20% of the 6.711 MMTCO2e it was in 2005, when it was 40% of all industrial emissions. That
reduction is due to the adoption of ambient temperature processing, unique chemicals and catalysts,
enzyme use, vacuum environment production, application of nano‐technology and improved thermal
management (ceramic insulators) systems. Little or no direct combustion is used and is replaced by
gasification, pyrolysis and Fisher‐Tropsh processes where products are more efficiently fractionated,
all gasses recovered and each element used at its highest and best value. Rankine cycle low
temperature heat recovery is used throughout industry to generate electricity.
Emissions from electric energy consumption are likewise reduced to 20% of 2005 levels through
transformation of conveyance, controls, refrigeration, adhesion and product processing technologies
and systems. Pumping, fans and motors are re‐designed through bio‐mimicry efficiency replication
(e.g. vortical versus centifugal). Refrigeration has been transformed by using non‐condensing CO2 or
inert gas refrigerant cycles with higher heat transfer rates, better dimpled heat exchange with nano‐
engineered surfaces Overall refrigeration demand is less through more use of aseptic vacuum
packaging. Organic light emitting diodes have reduced illumination and light sterilization processes
energy use to less than 5% of their 2005 energy intensity levels. It provides improved color rendition,
nanometer management, tuneable illumination levels, ten times longer equipment life and lower
overall GhG life cycle footprint. Space conditioning and air filtering loads dramatically reduced
through low fan speed air exchange, better filtration and reduced particulate production in plant
processes. Rare gasses used in microelectronics production (solvents, catalysts, cleaning agents) are
replaced with organic and naturally occurring solutions, methods and materials, further reducing high
global warming potential gasses.
All ozone depleting substance substitutes are now replaced by no or low GHG producing gasses and
solutions to include CO2 refrigeration, organic thermo‐chemicals, or no‐refrigeration or rankine cycle
production requirements. Refrigeration of Oregon industrially produced commodities is entirely
replaced by all aseptic vacuum packaging, increasing product qualities, shelf life and percent raw
materials to product ratios.
Practice. Industry associations, higher education and government collaborate on best practices and
production management by industry sector with regard to cross‐cutting technologies and approaches
as well as industry specific and unique processes.
The Market Transformation approach taken by Northwest Food Processors to reduce energy intensity
by 25% by 2020 is widespread across all industry sectors and includes: 1) Operational Improvements,
2) Operational Management Improvements, 3) Business and Quality Process Improvements, and 4)
Waste and Natural Resource Utilization [optimization]. Best available management and production
processes are detailed and practiced for each industrial facility in Oregon and metrics are managed on
a per product basis. Staff are trained, monitoring systems use common platforms and open sourced
software and input output controls and sensors to assure uniform data quality throughout industry.
Protocols are shared, and trained into place with industry associations sponsoring training in
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

conjunction with higher education and government. International and national benchmarking by
industry, product and industrial process are available, reliable and updated in real‐time so that
industry can compete in the global marketplace without revealing competitive details specific to their
firm or commodities.
Multiple businesses operate at each single facility. Businesses that just manage energy, feedstock’s,
packaging, marketing or process control have emerged, are successful and enhance the transfer of best
available practice and lowest cost of production considering all product attributes. Five nines, Six
Sigma and Lean Manufacturing, international Standards Organization (ISO) standards have evolved
into a digital information statistical process control realm where they fully integrate all industry
actions into the entire industrial enterprise in such a way that each element is not distinctly
distinguishable from standard practice.
Policy. Government’s statutory and administrative role and relationship with industry is as a partner.
Goals and targets are set by industry on a site and product specific basis. Governments’ role is
adopting law, policy and services necessary to accomplish those goals. A regulatory stance is only
adopted for determining minimum expected standards of practice and realizable reach goals.
Government’s role is in helping industry to organize, plan, research, train, adapt, afford and acquire
changes in practice and technology that advance their competitive position and accomplishment of
GhG reduction goals. Permitting and evaluating next generation or new applications is collaborative,
affordable and uses the best available information to identify consensus or compromise plans,
practices or designs.
Market(s). International and global markets recognize the value of low GhG products and they are
priced to prefer those with the lowest environmental cost with the highest qualities. Oregon’s
industrial products are sought after locally, nationally and to the extent they have low GhG
contributions. Local demand for local products, with the lowest GHG impact, makes Oregon industry
more competitive with higher margins through lower cost of delivery. A fully integrated multi‐modal
transportation system serves Oregon industry with maximally designed back‐hauling, lowest carbon
routes, timing, just‐in‐time logistics and co‐shipment allowing them more affordability of the best
available technologies and practices. State government and industry associations have a globally
recognized and deemed highly credible branding campaign with third party verified performance.
Energy Conversion and Utilization. Energy efficiency could be improved through incorporating the
best technologies in a systems approach. Technologies include solid oxide fuel cells, higher combustion
efficiencies, and using thermal energy in a systems approach to mill/plant design. In the longer term,
non‐combustion technologies are likely to have a significant impact, such as fuel cells and gasification
of biomass and in‐plant residues (e.g., black liquor in the forest products industry).
Increased on‐site power generation using materials currently sent for disposal and non‐combustion
technologies, such as fuel cells and gasification, will also play a crucial role in reaching energy
reduction targets in the industrial sector. Within manufacturing, materials and process industries
account for about 80% of the hazardous and toxic wastes and about 95% of nonhazardous wastes.
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 96



These wastes often impose high cleanup and disposal costs but offer the potential for recovering the
“embedded” energy and materials value. Steam and thermal system efficiencies can be improved by
more than 20% using cross‐cutting and proved technologies including better boiler technology,
improved burners and controls, better insulation, steam trap repair sizing and replacement,
condensate return and more efficient, lower chemical use water treatment.
Electric energy conversion technologies in lighting, pumping, fans, conveyance, power voltage
transformation and process systems can likewise be improved using cross‐cutting available
technologies. Fewer than 20 % of electric motors in Oregon industry are rated as premium efficiency
motors. Most motors under 50 horsepower in Oregon, with variable loads, have no variable speed or
frequency drives or controls. Latest generation, electronic ballast fluorescent lighting provides higher
lumens per watt that most industrial high intensity discharge lighting, allows for more switching
control and is underrepresented in industry applications. Electronic or organic light emitting diode
fixtures will soon provide even more energy efficiency, longer life and equivalent illumination qualities
to fluorescent systems.
Industrial Process Efficiency. The industrial sector is extraordinarily complex and heterogeneous.
The needs are diverse: hundreds of different processes are used to produce millions of different
products. Improving process efficiency will be done through implementation of site‐specific processes
and protocols with management directive to manage process and procedure controls to meet GHG
reduction targets and goals specific to products and facilities.
Some of the more broadly applicable industry process changes include: selective catalysts, advanced
separations, improved measurement and control systems, improved materials, and improved electric
motor systems, such as large motors with superconductivity wires, low temperature processing,
forming and . A particularly attractive longer‐term opportunity is the use of biotechnology and
bioderived materials.
The need exists to identify various industries collective high‐risk, high‐payoff technology needs. This
analysis allows higher education, U.S. Department of Energy (USDOE) and other federal research and
development (R&D) organizations to align their resources to best meet those needs. Industry
segments and local government need to align these interests and attract the participation of the
national laboratories, Department of Commerce–National Institute of Standards and Technology
Advanced Technology Program to focus resources specifically on GHG reduction strategies.
Emerging Technologies. Increased understanding in the fundamentals of chemistry, metallurgy, and
biotechnology will allow the development of innovative manufacturing processes. This knowledge,
along with advanced modeling and simulation, improved industrial materials, and measurements
(sensors) and intelligent control systems, will result in major incremental improvements and lead to
fundamental break‐throughs.
Resource Recovery and Utilization. This is a technological pathway is built on industrial ecology,
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020
Industrial Technical Committee

Page 97



wherein a community of producers and consumers perform in a closed system. Fossil energy is
conserved and/or energy is obtained from non‐GhG sources; materials are reused or recycled.
Through technological advances, the raw materials and resources needed for manufacturing can be
obtained by designing products for ease of disassembly and reuse.
Strategic Partnership. Strategic public–private R&D alliances for achieving GHG reduction goals in
energy‐ intensive industries is needed. These alliances need to be extended to embrace climate change
mitigation goals. Different types of public–private R&D partnerships are needed to reduce GhG
emissions in the light‐manufacturing sector. Finally, utility restructuring may challenge industrial self‐
generation and power sales using advanced industrial turbines integrated with combined‐cycle
generation or with non‐combustion generation techniques such as fuel cells.
Cross‐cutting energy efficiency solutions exist to cost effectively get GhG 10% below 1990 levels by
2020 in all Oregon industry sectors.
Cross­Cutting Technologies. Technologies, applicable across all industry sectors, are ready for
deployment, proved and have demonstrated cost effectiveness. Manufacturing process controls
include all systems and software that exert control over production processes. Control systems include
process sensors, data processing equipment, actuators, networks to connect equipment, and
algorithms to relate process variables to product attributes. These controls enable more
comprehensive analysis of process systems so that systems can be prioritized for cross‐cutting
technology evaluation and applications. Cross‐cutting applications include: Process Integration (pinch
analysis), Combined heat and power, Condensing package boilers (Super Boiler), Lower fan speed air
filtration and facilities HVAC, Advanced lighting technologies, Advanced lighting design, Advance
adjustable speed drive (ASD) designs, Advanced compressor controls, Compressed air system
management, Motor diagnostics, Motor system optimization, Pump efficiency improvement, Switched
reluctance motors, Advanced lubricants, Anearobic waste water treatment, High efficiency/low NOx
boiler burners, Membrane technology for wastewater treatment, Advanced Sensors and controls,
Advanced cooling tower controls, Advanced CHP turbine systems, Advanced reciprocating engines,
Fuel cells Microturbines,
Industry Specific Approaches. National industry directed technology “roadmaps” exist in the pulp
and paper, wood products, steel and iron, aluminum, chemicals, microelectronics, and food processing
sectors that address the technology needs both near and long‐term to reduce Oregon industrial energy
use and GhG emissions. Indexing the cost and emissions reductions attributable to these process
shifts, technology leaps and game changing applications is not done comprehensively at this time.
Food Processing. Northwest Food Processors Association (NWFPA) has adopted an industry‐wide
goal to reduce product energy intensity by 25% by 2020. NWFPA has developed a Roadmap to assist
the food processing industry in achieving this goal. The most definitive selection of food processing
technologies that reduce energy and GHG is the emerging technologies database developed by
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the NWFPA. In addition to the cross‐cutting industry
technologies, it identifies the leading edge and emerging technologies specific to most all food
manufacturing processes. In addition, the following, next generation technologies, will take the food
Oregon Global Warming Commission Industrial Use Roadmap to 2020

processing industry a long way towards 2050 GhG Reduction goals. Those technologies include: Low
temperature processing and aseptic packaging, Electron Beam Sterilization, biotechnology processing,
Heat recovery ‐ low temperature, Membrane technology – food, Cooling and storage management,
ultrasonic drying, and Closed‐cycle air refrigeration (CCAR).
Pulp and Paper. A 2006 report sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) concluded that the
U.S. pulp and paper industry could cost‐effectively reduce energy consumption from 2.36 quads to
1.75 quads, a 25 percent reduction from 2002 levels, by broadly implementing the best available
industry cross cutting technologies. Those savings could be greater by black liquor gasification,
condebelt drying, direct electrolytic causticizing, dry sheet forming, heat recovery – paper, high
consistency forming and impulse drying.
Chemicals. The chemical Industries Vision2020 Technology Partnership (Vision 2020) is an industry‐
led collaboration in the chemical and allied industries to leverage financial resources and technical
expertise. The goal is to accelerate innovation and technology development resulting in superior
materials, lower energy intensity and lower greenhouse gas emissions. Clean fractionation ‐ celluose
pulp, gas membrane technologies‐ chemicals, heat recovery technologies – chemicals, levulinic acid
from biomass (biofine), liquid membrane technologies – chemistry, new catalysts, and autothermal
reforming‐ammonia. Advancements are being applied in Nanotechnology and Nanomaterials,
Environmental, Safety, and Health Issues for Nanotechnology, R&D for Nanotechnology and
Nanomaterials, Alternative Feedstocks, Corrosion Reduction, Advanced Separations, Distillation, Ionic
Liquids, Process Intensification, Process Equipment Materials (Materials of Construction), and
Computational Fluid Dynamics.
Steel and Iron. BOF gas and sensible heat recovery, Near‐net shape casting/strip casting, New EAF
furnace processes, Oxy‐fuel combustion in reheat furnace, and Smelting reduction processes.
Ozone Depleting Substance Substitutes. The U.S Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is
leading national efforts to implement replacement of ozone depleting substance substitutes (ODSS). In
2007 ODSS contribute nearly 20% to Oregon industrial direct emissions. Those include: Hydro Fluro
Carbons (HFC) including some 16 compounds, Per Fluro Carbons (PFC) including some seven
compounds, Sulfur hexaflouride (SF6), and to a lesser extent NF3 and HFE 7100 and 7200. The USEPA
goal is to phase out all ODSS by 2050. Substitutes exist for most of these refrigerants and cleaning
agents but applications are underdeveloped. Acceptance of water, air and CO2 as refrigerants gasses is
emerging. Lower energy Stirling cycles and evaporative/desiccant or straight evaporative cooling
exist and can be commercialized for industrial application. Water lithium bromide absorption, or
ammonia water absorption are replacements for many CFC’s and HCFC’s, known ozone depleting
substances, that still exist in legacy systems. Direct nitrogen expansion, propane, propylene, CO2 or
butane is all applied as refrigerants. Non‐mechanical heat transfer and electronics cleaning can be
accomplished with methyl siloxanes and/or water to replace aerosol solvents. Powder coat
deposition, ultraviolet and electron beam curing replace or eliminate the need for solvent processes in
coatings and finishes. Mechanical cleaning and thermal vacuum de‐oiling processes currently replace
solvents in metals and electronics cleaning.

The purpose of the Committee was to develop and prioritize a set of strategies and actions for minimizing
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and increasing carbon storage in the Agriculture sector to meet Oregon’s 2020
greenhouse gas (GHG) goal. The recommendations will be considered by the Oregon Global Warming Commission
for inclusion in the Interim Roadmap to 2020/Report to the new Governor and Legislature, to state agencies, and
to Oregon’s Congressional delegation. Recommendations may also guide private sector investments and university
research agendas.
After several months of deliberations the Committee narrowed the Key Actions to the list below. Appendix A
contains the complete list of Recommended Actions developed by Agriculture Technical Committee. The
Committee’s Key Actions are more fully described in Section III – Key Actions For 2020. In summary they are:
•
•
•
•

Increase Nutrient Use Efficiency
Increase Carbon Sequestration in Crop Management
Develop Manure to Energy Methods
Proactively Prepare for and Adapt to Climate Change Impacts on Water Supply

II. FUTURE STATEMENTS
Oregon has a thriving, resilient agricultural industry that is part of a diverse rural economy that produces food and
agricultural crops more efficiently with fewer Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agriculture has prepared for and
adapted to climate changes in the most cost‐effective and sustainable ways. The multifaceted economic,
ecological and social benefits of farming and food systems to Oregon are recognized, quantified and rewarded,
including the provision of a diverse and sustainable array of food, feed, and horticultural products. Ecosystem
services such as carbon sequestration, clean air and water, healthy soil and wildlife habitat, visual amenities, and
the essential role of agriculture in creating the fabric of strong communities, cultures, and economies, are
recognized and rewarded.

Agricultural GHG reduction and carbon sequestration is an integral part of agricultural
conservation research, planning, outreach and incentive Programs.
Greenhouse gas reduction and carbon sequestration is one of multiple conservation goals for agricultural lands,
alongside water, air and soil quality and wildlife habitat, reflected in agricultural technical assistance programs,
agricultural research and outreach programs, and conservation funding programs.

Benefits of reducing atmospheric GHG emissions and sequestering carbon have been quantified and fully realized
on agricultural lands, where appropriate. Research has quantified the GHG reduction and carbon sequestration
possibilities on agricultural lands, including soil carbon sequestration rates, soil nitrous oxide emissions, livestock
diet strategies, and methane reduction through improved manure management. Research has developed the best
agricultural practices to realize GHG reductions and these have been demonstrated and adopted by farmers and
agricultural technical assistance and resource providers. Environmental policy and programs provide market‐based
and other economic incentives to farmers that foster the adoption of GHG reducing and sequestering practices
based on sound agri‐business considerations.
Agricultural management practices which effectively reduce and sequester GHG have been developed and applied
consistent with regional conditions. Practices include those that enhance soil carbon sequestration, improve
nitrogen use efficiency, increase ruminant digestion efficiency, capture gaseous emissions from manure and other
wastes, generate renewable energy from agricultural lands and agricultural waste products, and reduce energy and
fuel consumption

Agriculture has prepared for and adapted to climate changes using the most cost‐effective,
technically feasible and sustainable paths
Agricultural research, outreach, conservation technical and financial assistance, and risk management funding
programs have prepared agriculture for the effects of climate change, including reduced snowpack and seasonal
water supply, increased atmospheric carbon, drought, warmer average temperatures, extreme weather events,
and changes in pests and invasive plants. Through a combination of planning, research, education, efficiencies, and
infrastructure improvement, agriculture is a strong, thriving industry despite these challenges because it’s practices
and methods have evolved and adapted to a changing climate.
Ongoing efforts continue to help agriculture adapt and mitigate climate change. Research programs have
increased crop yields and quality, improved input efficiency, and reduced our dependence on external energy
sources. Examples of such programs include: crop breeding, crop management, abiotic stress management , soil
management, and crop management.
Investment has increased local and regional food production, processing and distribution capacity and
infrastructure to create a more resilient food system that better adapts to the uncertainties of climate change.

Agricultural GHG accounting is well established
Oregon has invested in the critical foundation for agriculture's full participation in state, national and international
mitigation and adaptation programs by developing a consistent means for establishing baseline GHG levels and for
addressing in a scientifically‐defensible manner additions and changes to these levels in GHG accounting.

Robust incentives and well functioning ecosystem markets exist
Robust incentives and ecosystem markets are available and accessible to landowners with operations of all sizes.
Measurable indices have been devised for agricultural systems (e.g. carbon, water quality, air quality, energy,
hydrology, wildlife, native vegetation, space).

Activity in the marketplace is at a level that investment returns to land owners are equal to or exceed inventory,
accounting, and other transaction costs.
Greenhouse gas reductions are accounted for, and aggregated information about their impact is shared globally.
Markets depend upon solid oversight and accountability from national and international governing body.

Market emergence and function has resulted in a sustainable supply of verifiable ecosystem services that continue
to motivate and maintain long‐term investment. State governments cooperate with implementing and
administering national and international policy agreements and standards for market participation and verification.

III. KEY ACTIONS FOR 2020
Each of the priority actions described below requires capacity, commitment, and funding for ongoing research,
outreach and easily accessible incentives and financing. Without capacity, commitment and funding, the change
that is possible in Oregon agriculture to reduce GHG emissions and adapt to climate change will not be realized. In
a time of shrinking budgets, this means that budgets for university and local resource provider staff to do research
and outreach, and for incentives and financing for GHG reduction, carbon sequestration and climate change
adaptation must be increased.

1.1. Create targeted research, outreach programs, technical assistance and tools that increase nutrient use
efficiency in Oregon agriculture.
1.2. Research soil emission coefficients to establish baseline and future emissions data.
1.3. Create an initiative to identify strategies and actions to close the nutrient loop (better utilize all organic
materials, urban and rural, for plant nutrition and building soil quality). Bring together waste management
industry and agricultural industry to determine how to more efficiently use organic materials in an economically
viable way.

2. Increase Carbon Sequestration in Crop Management
2.1. Determine irrigated soil carbon sequestration rates.
2.2. Encourage practices that sequester carbon in the soil and build soil quality.
2.3. Increase outreach and incentives to protect and restore native vegetation, habitats and riparian areas along
agricultural lands.

3. Develop Manure to Energy Methods
3.1. Develop low‐cost technology, incentives, offsets and technical assistance to significantly increase adoption of
methane capture and digester technology for all size animal operations.

4. Proactively Prepare for and Adapt to Climate Change Impacts on Water Supply
4.1. Promote irrigation efficiency.
4.2. Help facilitate water storage projects at all scales that are protective of Oregon’s watersheds and natural
resources.

Forestry Roadmap to 2020
Report to the Oregon Global Warming Commission
The following report, Forestry Roadmap to 2020, was developed by the Forestry Technical
Committee of the Oregon Global Warming Commission (OGWC). Forestry Committee members are
listed in Appendix B of this report.

I. PURPOSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of the Committee was to develop and prioritize a set of strategies and actions for
primarily increasing carbon storage in forest ecosystems and long‐lived forest products to meet
Oregon’s 2020 greenhouse gas (GHG) goal. The recommendations will be considered by the Oregon
Global Warming Commission for inclusion in the Interim Roadmap to 2020/Report to the new
Governor and Legislature, to state agencies, and to Oregon’s Congressional delegation.
Recommendations may also guide private sector investments and university research agendas.
After several months of deliberations the Committee narrowed the Key Actions from a possible 31
to 4. Appendix A contains the consolidated Inventory of Actions developed by Forestry Technical
Committee. The Committee’s Key Actions are more fully described in Section III – Key Actions For
2020. In summary they are:

•
•
•
•

Establish a Carbon Inventory for Oregon Forests

Invest in Key Research to understand the impacts of climate change on carbon storage
in forests
Pursue Reforestation/Afforestation
Advance Energy and Forest policies supporting biomass facilities

The Committee recognized that “Oregon’s forests” and “Federal forests” are often used
interchangeably; the error is understandable, since Oregon is substantially (61%) federally‐
owned17, mostly by the US Forest Service and the US Bureau of Land Management. But State and
privately‐owned forests are extensive, are generally more productive, often include critical
ecosystems, and are frequently contiguous with or interspersed among the federal lands. Other,
non‐forested private lands are also placed such that what occurs on those lands affects the adjacent
forest in significant ways (fire occurring in the urban/wild interface is one example; effects in
watersheds critical to endangered species is another).
Thus carbon policy addressing and affecting forestlands, forest practices and forest products
require particular attention to common strategies and collaborative practices.
The
17

Oregon Forest Ownership: 61% Federal, 19% Industrial Private, 15% Non‐industrial Private, 3% State, and 2%
Tribal and other public lands

Forestry Technical Committee

Page 108



recommendations in this section of the Oregon Roadmap to 2020 are meant to be read in that
context. Policies on Federal, State and private lands do not need to be identical – in fact they must
often be different but complementary. But each ownership type must inform and be informed by
the others. Policies must be developed collaboratively, and executed across jurisdictional lines
when ecosystems and carbon outcomes stretch across those lines.

II. FUTURE STATEMENTS
The forest sector’s contribution to achieving Oregon’s greenhouse gas reductions goals will come
primarily from increased carbon storage in forest ecosystems and long‐lived forest products.
Despite predictive modeling and speculation, the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems
are still uncertain and may, therefore, complicate future policy goals. For example, there is
scientific consensus that the increase in average temperature predicted to occur will result in
widespread changes in the geographic distribution of many tree species. How these changes occur
across Oregon’s ecoregions and then translate into the changes in the potential for carbon storage
is highly uncertain. The probable increase in severe wildfires will add additional uncertainty to
planning efforts and confound long‐term projects to store more carbon in forest ecosystems.
Expectations for carbon storage must reflect both geography and traditional benefits expected by
various forest ownerships. The moist forest ecosystems west of the Cascade crest are more
productive and have a greater opportunity for carbon storage than the drier eastside forestlands
where the potential and occurrence of fires is much greater. These differences require different
carbon strategies for different forest circumstances. Private and public forests have owners with
different management objectives and expectations for economic returns that will likely result in
different carbon strategies and outcomes.
Oregon’s forest carbon management strategies are integrated into overall sustainable forestry
objectives and practices that address fire regimes, insects, disease, drought, invasion by exotic
species, and ecosystem function. Ecosystem dysfunctions resulting from misguided past practices –
fire suppression, juniper range expansion – are addressed with policies that simultaneously target
both increased carbon storage and resilient, productive forests. And since forest ecosystems cross
the jurisdictional lines of forest management agencies common strategies and collaborative
implementation must become standard practice.
With these primary qualifiers, the following describes one plausible pathway to Oregon’s forest
sector reducing Oregon’s share of the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2050 and
beyond.

Federal and State Land Use Policies
Land use policies between 2010 and 2050 have been successful in reversing the historical trend and
preventing forest land from converting to other uses, resulting in no net loss of forest land 18 ,
enabling a measurable gain in statewide carbon storage. Cooperative and effective implementation
18 Intended to be consistent with current forest land composition and not a changed composition that
includes less desired types, such as juniper woodlands.

Oregon Global Warming Commission Forestry Roadmap to 2020
Forestry Technical Committee

Page 109



of land use policies combined with forest carbon offset markets or other programs that reward
reforestation have resulted in a net increase in forest area. Significant investments have enhanced
the extent of services and benefits provided by Oregon’s forests, including carbon sequestration
and a long‐lived product pool.

Federal Forest Lands
Federal Forest land managers have collaborated with State and private forestland counterparts to
work for measureable contributions in reducing Oregon’s share of global CO2 emissions. Policies
have acknowledged the different goals for forests east (generally drier) and west (generally wetter)
of the Cascades with an overall increase in forest carbon stores. East‐side forests have been
managed primarily for ecosystem restoration, safety, and climate adaptation with a minimum of
incurred carbon debts (e.g., loss). West‐side forests have been managed under national polices that
protect broad ecosystem values consistent with the Oregon Global Warming Commission’s desire to
increase carbon storage to what is practically achievable in 40 years (and those policies are ongoing
beyond 2050, although annual carbon gains will level off). Achievable carbon storage levels were
arrived at by evaluating the costs and benefits of management for optimal carbon storage, then
adjusting for the long term sustainability of other valued benefits and services expected from forest
ecosystems that might be compromised in a one‐dimensional focus on higher carbon densities 19 .

State‐Owned Forest Lands
State‐owned forest lands have been managed for multiple purposes including the long‐term storage
of carbon, with an overall goal of increasing carbon capture through management practices,
afforestation and reforestation. Major forest policy and management decisions are informed by a
clear accounting of the consequent change in carbon storage that will occur. There has been a net
increase in the amount of forest land owned and managed by the State. Much of the additional
forest land has a carbon storage obligation within the terms of the property transfer. Oregon’s
state‐owned forest lands show a measurable contribution to reducing atmospheric CO2.

Privately‐Owned forests
The net area of private forestlands in Oregon has remained constant since 2010, and the lands have
been managed primarily for production of timber and wood products. Carbon storage levels have
remained constant across all such lands, and in some cases have increased due to voluntary owner
actions, frequently in collaboration with ecosystem services market mechanisms.
Atmospheric GHG reduction benefits have been optimized on private lands based on life‐cycle
analysis primarily through the following:
•

The GHG reduction benefits of wood‐based building materials over higher energy alternatives
have been calculated to general government and stakeholder satisfaction, and are reflected in
mitigation policies.

19 For example, the policy tradeoffs would have to be seriously evaluated if research were to consistently
show that the forest sector could reach higher overall carbon storage densities, while protecting ecosystem
function and species biodiversity, by allowing some conversion from the live tree pool to the products pool on
federal forest lands to raise sequestration levels on non‐federal forests.

Oregon Global Warming Commission Forestry Roadmap to 2020
Forestry Technical Committee

Page 110



•

GHG reduction benefits have been realized from a fully developed bioenergy infrastructure for
the sustainable use of forest biomass residue and the anthropic waste stream.

•

Additional GHG reduction benefits have been enabled through public and private sector
investments using generally accepted certification standards and guidelines to promote carbon
densification on privately owned forest lands.

Ecosystem Services Markets
Carbon prices and markets have fully emerged and are available to landowners of all sizes. This has
created the appropriate incentives for forest conservation, improved forest management, and the
use of bioenergy and wood substitutes. Measurable indices have been devised for forest systems
investments (e.g. carbon, fiber, air, energy, hydrology, wildlife, information, space). These are
updated on a regular basis, garnering widespread interest and motivating investment. Market
decisions and investor confidence are integrally linked with the forest monitoring and carbon
accounting systems described above.
•

Activity in the marketplace is at a level such that investment returns to forest owners are equal
to or exceed their inventory, accounting and other transaction costs.

•

Market investments and forest carbon accounting data are validated and shared globally.

•

Markets depend upon solid oversight from national and international governing bodies.

Market in verifiable ecosystem services have emerged, resulting in a sustainable supply of services
including but not limited to carbon storage that continue to motivate and maintain long‐term
investment. Market structures permit participation by both large and small forestland owners.
State governments cooperate with implementing and administering national and international
policy agreements and standards for market participation and verification.

Forest Inventory and Carbon Accounting
A practical and statistical level of sufficiency in a standardized system of forest monitoring and
carbon accounting of the role of Oregon’s forests, on a lifecycle basis, in storing and contributing to
the reduction in GHG levels has been established. This standardized carbon accounting system for
the forest sector is sufficient for the full emergence of a solid ecosystem services marketplace. The
system comprises a robust set of integrated state‐of‐the‐art technologies encompassing biomass
and carbon inventories, analysis and modeling, and reporting. Inventories continue to be a
combination of field‐based data collection systems and analyses of space and air‐based remote
sensing imagery. These technologies have become affordable and more integrated as technologies
advance and emerge in image sensors, computational software and hardware, and atmospheric gas
exchange. Significant improvements have been made to estimating carbon quantities in the
components and transactions comprising forest ecosystems. Routine advancements in technology
in each of these areas are being integrated to where they are mutually reinforcing and
interdependent. A workforce capable of implementing these new accounting technologies has
been trained.
Oregon Global Warming Commission Forestry Roadmap to 2020
Forestry Technical Committee

Bioenergy and biofuels
After evaluation and verification of net carbon benefit, advances in technologies for bioenergy
systems have allowed for biomass energy in the forest management sector. Fuels management,
recovery and conversion technologies, and the scheduling and sequencing of forest biomass
removal have been optimized to minimize short‐term carbon debt. Demand for low‐carbon energy
production from forests has led to the integration of biofuel production from forest biomass with
the timber harvest and transport systems. That biomass‐sourced energy powers the removal and
transportation of excess forest fuels out of Oregon’s forests while also providing a supply of
materials to the product carbon storage pool to benefit humanity, consistent with other values
including adequate preservation of genetic material, hydrologic function, O2 production, and forest
productivity (CO2 conversion).
The need to minimize the cost of management and transport of forest material has led to
efficiencies in the removal, processing and transportation of the lower size range of forest material
to maximize volume per unit haul distance. Technological breakthroughs in advanced materials
engineering enable more energy and carbon efficient on‐site processing operations.

Education and Public Perception
The general public has an understanding for the role that forests and forest products play in carbon
management.
There is widespread understanding and acceptance that forest ecosystems are a principle
component in, and valued as, a set of life supporting systems on the planet. This perception is
brought about through advanced scientific understanding of the Earth’s interacting biophysical
systems and wide distribution of this knowledge through advances in free, widespread and highly
effective social education systems. Advanced systems in technology for monitoring and measuring
(remote sensing, field‐based) forest functions ‐‐ from atmospheric gas exchange to continuous
detection and counting of individual organisms ‐‐ has reduced uncertainty in resource composition,
abundance, and flux. This advanced understanding of human interdependence with other
biological systems has nurtured investments in the long‐term sustainability, and management of
multiple benefits supplied by forest ecosystems.
Investments have been made in the development of new technology and the transfer of that
technological knowledge to landowners of all types. The lessons learned are propagated broadly to
the public, and in more targeted ways (e.g., best practices; technology transfers) to forest
landowners, forest workers and regulators.

III. KEY ACTIONS FOR 2020
The following Key Actions were developed in part by reviewing various local and regional Global
Warming plans and developing enhanced recommendations where possible. The remaining actions are
included in Appendix A.
• Establish a Carbon Inventory for Oregon Forests

•
•
•

Pursue Reforestation/Afforestation
Invest in Key Research Actions ‐ impacts of climate change, adaptation tools, and
benefits of durable products
Advance Energy and Forest policies supporting biomass facilities

Overall goal: Between 2010 and 2150 20 , no net loss of Oregon forested lands
and a net gain in carbon storage in an amount to be determined.
Oregon’s forests are a carbon sink, capturing more carbon than they release. As such, Oregon’s
forests and its forest sector have and will continue to contribute to the goal of achieving reductions
in greenhouse gas emissions by remaining a robust and sustainable sector in Oregon.

2. Carbon Inventory
2.1. Establish a carbon inventory for all Oregon forests. This will require a collaborative effort to
define and develop an agreed upon approach for developing and maintaining a carbon
inventory system.
Based on these data, establish baselines and both long‐term and
intermediate goals for carbon storage, for different forests types and ownerships, including
overall storage gains in public forests.

3. Reforestation/Afforestation/Acquisition
3.1. The Federal government, the State and Oregon communities should seek reforestation
opportunities on lands previously forested, irrespective of ownership.
3.2. The Federal government should assure sufficient resources for reforestation on Federal
forestlands.
3.3. The Federal, State, Local, and non‐profit sectors should seek to acquire forestlands that can be
conserved, restored and managed.
3.4. Afforestation opportunities should also be sought and welcomed, but should be carefully
evaluated for unintended consequences to ecosystem values before proceeding (e.g. “planting
of non‐native trees rather than natives”).

4. Research
4.1. Oregon Climate Change Research Institute and the Oregon University System should
collaborate with the Federal and State Government and private land owners to project and
20 The effects of actions in the forestry sector are realized over many decades. We recommend 2150 as the
end‐date for the Commission's Forestry vision rather than 2050 to communicate the time‐scale differences
between this sector and the others that make up Oregon's carbon reduction management strategies.

map actual changes in the productivity, function, and fire susceptibility of Oregon’s forested
ecosystem as well as changes in the geography of forest biodiversity that are anticipated from
changes in climate.
4.2. A significant effort within the broader scientific community should be given to identifying a
comprehensive set of features, across sectors, predicted to be affected by changes in climate
and their impact on carbon storage. These features, or indicators should become the focus of
status and trend monitoring to inform adaptation planning at local and regional levels.
4.3. Oregon Department of Forestry, Department of Environmental Quality, and stakeholders, in
collaboration with the Oregon University System and identified experts, should develop a
strategy for use and reuse of durable forest products, along with carbon sequestration/gain
values that may accrue.
4.4. Oregon University System, in collaboration with other relevant research entities, will support
the research and design of information and tools necessary to support the carbon inventory
system outlined in Section 1.1.

5. Biomass
5.1. State of Oregon energy and forest policies and tax incentives should encourage landowners to
develop forest and range biomass production capabilities supporting biomass energy facilities
where this can be done consistent with or enhancing ecosystem values.

Materials Management Roadmap to 2020
Report to the Oregon Global Warming Commission
The following report, Materials Management Roadmap to 2020, was developed by the Materials
Management Technical Committee of the Oregon Global Warming Commission (OGWC). Materials
Management Committee members are listed in Appendix B of this report.

I. PURPOSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of the Committee was to develop and prioritize a set of strategies and actions for
reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with materials use to meet Oregon’s 2020 greenhouse
gas (GHG) goal. The recommendations will be considered by the Oregon Global Warming
Commission for inclusion in the Interim Roadmap to 2020/Report to the new Governor and
Legislature, to state agencies, and to Oregon’s Congressional delegation. Recommendations may
also guide private sector investments and university research agendas.
After several months of deliberations the Committee developed the 9 Key Actions listed below from
a brainstormed list of over 100 that was distilled down to a recommended list of approximately 40.
Appendix A contains the Recommended Inventory of Actions developed by Materials Management
Technical Committee. The Committee’s Key Actions are more fully described in Section III – Key
Actions For 2020. In summary they are:
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Advocate for carbon price signal across life cycle of products and materials (either by an
emissions cap and/or a carbon tax), including imports (border adjustment
mechanism/carbon tariff if necessary).
Research and integrate a consumption‐based GHG inventory methodology with the State's
conventional inventory, and identify high‐carbon product categories
Develop and disseminate information: easy‐to‐use life cycle metrics for different food types
Establish standards, incentives, and/or mandates for carbon footprinting, labeling of
products
Focus product stewardship on upstream emissions and design for appropriate durability,
repairability, reusability, efficiency, and recovery
Establish higher standards for new buildings: “net zero” plus offset of materials
Provide consumer education, information, outreach on consumption, materials use, and
prevention/reuse, including low‐GHG food and diet choices
Reduce (prevent) waste of food at the retail and consumer level by 5‐50%
Conduct research on highest/best use for organic wastes and the carbon impact of different
conversion technologies

“Materials Management” refers to how we manage material resources as they flow through the
economy, from extraction or harvest of materials and food, production and transport of goods,
reuse of materials, and recycling, composting, and disposal. Approximately 42% of GHG emissions in
the U.S. are associated with these activities, primarily manufacturing. 21 Emissions are even larger if
the impacts of imported goods are considered. 22 Emissions occur across the entire life cycle of
these goods, although most occur “upstream” of the consumer, primarily in manufacturing.
The Materials Management Committee considered opportunities to reduce GHG emissions
associated with the life cycle of materials used in Oregon. This perspective results in some overlap
with all other committees convened as part of the Commission’s 2020 Vision project. However, an
important difference is that while the Materials Management Committee focused on products used
in Oregon, committees such as Industry, Agriculture, and Materials Management focused on
products produced in Oregon. This combination of demand‐ and supply‐side perspectives provides
the Commission with an unusually broad and comprehensive view of how Oregon contributes to
climate change.
Many of the emissions associated with materials used in Oregon do not occur in Oregon, and as
such, are not included in Oregon’s current greenhouse gas inventory. A separate project by DEQ,
involving the development of a supplemental, consumption‐based greenhouse gas inventory for
Oregon, will shed more light on the impact of materials – and all other goods and services –
consumed in Oregon. That project is not yet complete. In the meantime, it is important to
understand that actions in Oregon can reduce emissions occurring in other states and nations.
Some of the emissions reductions resulting from the recommendations contained herein may not
be counted by Oregon’s greenhouse gas inventory, but are nonetheless just as real, and just as
impactful to Oregon’s climate, as reductions of in‐state emissions.

II. FUTURE STATEMENTS
In the early 1970s, Oregon championed protection of the environment and quality of life through
the nation’s first bottle bill, land use planning system, and beach protections. We can be proud of
this legacy, but today’s challenges again call for bold vision and leadership. Our vision is that by
2050, Oregon has achieved major reductions in the emissions associated with the full life cycle of
materials. These emissions have fallen to 88% below 1990 levels on a per‐capita basis. The State
has achieved its goal of a 75% reduction in absolute GHG emissions, when viewed both from a
traditional inventory perspective (which focuses on the in‐state production of materials) and also
through the lens of consumption‐based accounting (which focuses on the in‐state consumption of
materials). Both carbon‐intensive production and carbon‐intensive consumption have shifted to
significantly lower carbon pathways. By finding ways to meet our needs without massive (and
growing) resource consumption, Oregon communities and families have become stronger. Greater
emphasis is placed on family, community, economic sensibility, personal health and development,
and preserving our great natural heritage for future generations.

This significant reduction in emissions is a result of major changes in state, national, and
international policies to address global warming and GHG emissions. Both producers (supply) and
consumers (demand) have become involved in reducing emissions across all of the stages of the life
cycle of materials and products used in Oregon, including raw material extraction, production,
purchase, use, and end‐of‐life management. Because of the significance of emissions associated
with production, significant supply‐side changes have been made both inside and outside of
Oregon.
By 2050, producers and consumers have long been provided with clear information regarding the
climate impacts of their choices, including choices involving materials; as a result, producers are
making and consumers are choosing materials that have significantly (~90%) lower life cycle
emissions. Particular attention has been given to growing both the supply and demand of materials
that are “regenerative,” that is, that have the impact of removing carbon from the atmosphere
when viewed over their entire life cycle. In some cases, this means that producers continue to
make the same materials and products that were made in 1990, but use very different (low‐ and no‐
carbon) energy sources or production techniques. In other cases, producers are making new
materials and products in lieu of some of the high‐impact materials and products used and
produced in 1990.
By 2050, through a combination of regulations, financial incentives, and consumer demand,
producers of both goods and services making these changes have seen their businesses grow
sustainably, while companies continuing to produce and/or use high‐carbon materials have seen
significant declines in market share. The new investments and production processes required for
Oregon to achieve this vision have provided for economic and community vitality, by absorbing job
losses resulting from the transition away from carbon‐intensive materials, products, and processes.
By 2050, the cost of carbon (and other externalities) has been reflected in the price of goods,
providing an added incentive to favor low‐carbon production and consumption, while leading to a
more efficient allocation of resources. Consumers, producers, and policymakers are also using the
concept of a “carbon budget,” an allowable amount of carbon that individuals, organizations, and
communities can emit while achieving broad carbon emissions goals.
By 2050, the vision of product stewardship has been fully realized, and all parties involved in the
design, production, sale and use of a product are taking responsibility for minimizing the product’s
environmental impact throughout all stages of the product’s life. Producers, who have the greatest
opportunity to reduce carbon impacts via “upstream” processes, have been actively and positively
engaged. Early product stewardship activities, such as Oregon E‐Cycles, where producers took
greater responsibility for reducing product impacts at end‐of‐life, have continued, but the focus of
product stewardship has expanded so that producers are taking responsibility for reducing the full
life cycle impacts of their products, including greenhouse gases. Product life cycle impacts are being
optimized holistically as opposed to optimizing individual life cycle stages. Efforts to achieve carbon
goals have not significant increased other environmental impacts.
By 2050, “net zero” buildings – both residential and commercial – are the norm. Evaluation of the
built environment's contribution to climate change includes the full life cycle impacts of materials,
and this more comprehensive view leads to greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

Oregon Global Warming Commission Materials Management Roadmap to 2020

By 2050, consumers have shifted their consumption of materials in favor of categories of products
with lower carbon impacts, individual products that are “best in class” at reducing carbon
emissions, and low‐impact services. Oregonians are being provided with clear information on the
carbon impact of products and how to reduce those impacts.
Oregon households have also increased their emphasis on education, savings and investment,
providing them with stronger financial security, while also providing society with the human capital
(education) and physical capital (infrastructure) necessary to transition to a low‐carbon economy.
Less money and time spent acquiring, maintaining, and managing stuff is allowing for greater
emphasis on family, community, and personal health and development. As consumption returns to
a level that can be sustained, shifts in investment, economic conditions, and social values have also
enabled an equitable reduction in the average number of hours worked, slowing the treadmill of
“work and spend.”
While every Oregonian may be taking different paths to reduce their carbon footprints (associated
with materials), examples of some of the common changes include the following:
• The use of energy‐consuming products (cars, TVs, refrigerators, furnaces, etc.) is reduced, and those
products that do use energy are highly efficient.
• Caloric intake of food is reduced to levels that optimize health, reversing the current epidemic of
obesity (and associated health costs). Diets shift in favor of foods that offer simultaneous carbon
reduction and health benefits.
• More Oregonians enjoy the benefits of living in homes that are high‐quality, smaller, and energy‐
efficient. Multi‐family dwellings and co‐housing arrangements also allow for reductions in the
climate‐related impacts of materials. Building materials are designed and selected to optimize life
cycle carbon reductions.
• Consumers favor low‐carbon services over goods, for example, giving more experiential gifts and
less “stuff” as gifts during holidays and celebrations.
• Individuals at all economic levels increase personal savings.
• Products are chosen from companies that employ best‐in‐class methods of low‐carbon production
and transportation.
• Products are designed to be appropriately durable, repairable, efficient, and recoverable.
Consumers maintain, repair and upgrade them so as to minimize replacement, as appropriate.
• Consumers increasingly favor the purchase of reused goods over new. As products are made to last,
the quality of reused goods is significantly improved.
• Material waste is minimized. For example, grocery stores, restaurants, and individual consumers all
take steps to reduce the purchase of food that goes uneaten. More efficient use of purchased
goods frees up resources for more productive uses.
• Products are being designed to facilitate recovery at end‐of‐life.
By 2050, when products and other materials are no longer wanted and cannot be reused, Oregon
residents and businesses recover them for their next highest and best use. Organic wastes, such as
food, are being diverted to facilities such as anaerobic digesters, composting sites, or other
appropriate technologies. Recyclables are recycled at high rates, with a focus on “upcycling” to best
uses. New recycling processes (both for existing recyclables and materials that currently were not
recycled in 1990) – as well as select energy recovery processes – allow for the production of new
materials and energy with significantly lower carbon impacts. Landfill methane emissions have long
been minimized, both as the inflow of putrescible wastes has been reduced, and as landfills have
Oregon Global Warming Commission Materials Management Roadmap to 2020
Materials Management Technical Committee

Page 128



continued to implement design and operational controls that reduce methane emissions. Methane
from the decomposition of legacy wastes is recovered for energy, but landfilling has become truly
an option of last resort. Similarly, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions from waste
incinerators have been reduced as waste flows have shrunk and shifted to uses elsewhere with
lower carbon impacts. Waste management decisions regarding cost‐effectiveness are made
including full social costs (including the cost of greenhouse gases).
While Oregon has made significant changes since 1990, other states and nations have as well. As a
result, Oregonians in 2050 – and residents everywhere on our planet – are living much closer to the
vision of sustainability. Oregonians are enjoying vibrant communities, strong families, and the
benefits of personal health, economic sensibility, and a healthy environment.

III. KEY ACTIONS FOR 2020
The following Key Actions were developed in part by reviewing various local and regional Global
Warming plans and developing enhanced recommendations where possible. The remaining actions
are included in Appendices A and C.

1. Advocate for carbon price signal across life cycle of products and materials
(either by an emissions cap and/or a carbon tax), including imports (border
adjustment mechanism/carbon tariff if necessary)
Summary: The Commission should advocate for policies that incorporate a carbon price signal across the
life cycle of products and other materials. A price on carbon across the full life cycle (resource
extraction, manufacturing, transport, use, and end‐of‐life) offers the potential for significant reductions
in greenhouse gas emissions associated with the life cycle of products and materials.
The Materials Management Committee did not evaluate the relative advantages and disadvantages of
capping emissions (either via “cap‐and‐trade”, “cap‐and‐dividend” or some variation) vs. taxing
emissions. However, given the global nature of many supply chains, and keeping with the Committee’s
vision of not penalizing Oregon or other domestic producers (relative to foreign competition), it will
likely be important to apply a “border adjustment mechanism” to help ensure a level playing field. This
mechanism, often discussed in the form of a carbon tariff, adds to the price of products that are made in
locations whereby some or all of their upstream emissions are not covered by a carbon cap and/or tax.
Lead: Oregon Congressional delegation, Governor’s Office, Global Warming Commission.
Type of Action: Regulation (federal and/or international).
Timing of Impact: Likely medium‐term (5‐10 years) or long‐term (10+ years). Although legislation might
pass in the short‐term (1‐5 years), implementation of most key elements is expected to not occur for
several years.
GHG Savings? Yes. Potentially 3.39 – 20.57 million MTCO2e in 2020, excluding direct use of fuels and
electricity by consumers. 23
23Two estimates of emissions associated with the life cycle of materials (excluding use phase) are developed.
The first draws on EPA and Carnegie Mellon University research that suggests that production, transport, and
disposal of materials used in the US contribute emissions (some overseas) equal to 49% of the domestic GHG
inventory. This is applied to Oregon’s GHG inventory (2005) and scaled upward to 2020 for an estimate of

Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.

2. Conduct research to develop a consumption‐based GHG inventory and
inventory methodology; consider integration with State’s conventional
inventory, identify high‐carbon product categories
Summary: One of the fundamental challenges facing materials management programs and policies is the
manner in which greenhouse gas emissions are typically inventoried, and how these inventories and
subsequently communicated and used. Inventories typically focus on emissions inside the geographic
area, although they often adjust for electricity used (even if the production of the electricity occurs
elsewhere). Materials management contributes significantly to emissions – 42% of domestic emissions
by EPA’s estimate – but many of the emissions go uncounted in state and especially in local inventories.
As a result, the nexus of materials management and greenhouse gas emissions reduction has generally
suffered from benign neglect. The Commission’s 2020 Vision project and the establishment of the
Materials Management Committee is a notable exception, but the field still suffers from challenges
associated with emissions accounting.
One potential solution that has attracted interest in the last few years is consumption‐based accounting.
DEQ already has a project underway to develop a consumption‐based GHG inventory for Oregon. This
project has several limitations, including that fact that it is a first‐generation model (Oregon is the first
community in the U.S. to undertake such an inventory), is limited to the year 2005, and may not be
readily usable by local governments in their climate action planning efforts. Further, it isn’t yet clear if
consumption‐based accounting can be integrated with the state’s conventional inventory, what the
limitations of consumption‐based accounting are, and what would be required to conduct a
consumption‐based inventory in future years.
DEQ should complete this project, and then the Global Warming Commission should convene a
workgroup to review the state’s GHG inventory and consider if and how consumption‐based accounting
could be integrated into it. (A separate workgroup convened by DEQ, including a representative from
the Commission, will meet in September and October of 2010 to review DEQ’s draft consumption‐based
inventory and this will inform DEQ’s next steps.)
Also, one of the benefits of consumption‐based accounting is that it provides information on the GHG
intensity and emissions associated with different categories of consumption, including different
41.1 million mTCO2e. Alternatively, DEQ’s preliminary draft consumption‐based emissions inventory
(unpublished) estimates life cycle emissions (excluding use) of materials consumed in Oregon; scaling upward
to 2020 results in an estimate of 33.9 million mTCO2e. These provide a low and high estimate of materials‐
related GHG emissions. These low and high estimates are then multiplied by low (10%) and high (50%)
estimates of the potential reductions in GHG emissions that would result from a carbon cap and/or tax,
including some kind of border adjustment mechanism. This represents an exceptionally crude estimate for
the purpose of estimating the order of magnitude of potential reductions, and in no way should be
interpreted as a critical evaluation of the likely results of either a carbon cap or a carbon tax. Actual
emissions reductions are highly dependent on the actual design and implementation of the cap and/or tax.
Additionally, the estimate includes only life cycle emissions of materials/products excluding use of
appliances, devices, vehicles, etc. by consumers, so the potential emissions reductions in transportation and
building energy sectors associated with a carbon cap and/or tax are significantly underestimated here.

categories of products and materials. This could be very useful for the purposes of policy and program
development and implementation. DEQ’s current effort will provide a screening‐level evaluation of
different products and materials; to be widely accepted, these results will likely need verification via
process life cycle assessments/carbon footprints or some other method, thus requiring additional effort.

3. Develop and disseminate information: easy‐to‐use life cycle metrics for
different food types
Summary: The State should develop and disseminate information that will aid consumers and retailers
in food purchasing decisions. Foundational data would help to disseminate estimates of the industry‐
average “carbon footprint” for different types of foods, as well as for key variables in the life cycle of
those foods. For example, tomatoes may have different greenhouse gas impacts depending on whether
they are grown in soils or hydroponically, what soil conditions they are grown in, how they are fertilized,
whether they are grown in greenhouses, how the greenhouses are heated, how the tomatoes are
packaged, and how and how far they are transported to market. Knowing the relative contribution of
each life cycle stage and also the relative impact (or lack thereof) of these variables would spur better
decision‐making and reduce the current state of confusion. Fortunately, extensive research has already
been undertaken (and more is underway) on estimating the carbon footprint of many different common
foods. This foundational life cycle‐based GHG data could be summarized and made available in several
different formats, such as a website, a cell phone application, or even displayed in retail stores using
simple color‐coded carbon footprint indicators or wallet cards listing the “top 10” carbon‐intensive food
products. This information can aid retail buyers trying to make better purchasing decisions.

Fossil Fuel Savings: Yes. Quantity unknown and dependent upon how food choices and quantity of
consumption shift.
Cost (savings?): Unknown, but some cost associated with collecting, reviewing, and summarizing data in

Cost effectiveness: Unknown
Comments: Providing life cycle information on food products is fundamental to any practice which
affects consumer choice/demand. This practice is largely foundational and enables targeted efforts
(such as education, see recommendation #7) to achieve reductions.

4. Standards, incentives, and/or mandates for carbon footprinting, labeling of
products
Summary: Carbon footprinting refers to the act of evaluating the greenhouse gas emissions associated
with the life cycle of a product. Products can be both consumer goods and also products or materials
sold business‐to‐business. Carbon footprints can be shared with customers either indirectly (on request,
akin to a material safety data sheet) or via a carbon label (akin to a nutrition label) printed on the
product or its packaging.
Carbon footprinting and/or labeling is believed to reduce GHG emissions in several ways. First, as the
producer examines the greenhouse gas emissions associated with a product, it gains better
understanding of the causes of these emissions and opportunities to reduce them. Second, knowing
that customers (consumers, other businesses) may use the carbon footprint (or label) in product
selection, producers are incented to reduce their emissions. Finally, customers may use the footprint or
label to reduce the GHG emissions associated with their own purchases.
The State should advocate for and/or adopt standards, incentives, and/or mandates for carbon
footprinting and/or labeling.

•

•

Standards refer to the accounting methods or rules that guide the actual analysis and
reporting. Good standards provide for carbon footprints that are comprehensive,
meaningful, clear, and transparent. Two existing standards include the PAS 2050 carbon
footprint standard (developed by BSI British Standards on behalf of the UK Department
of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Carbon Trust) and the newly‐developed
Product Life Cycle Accounting and Reporting Standard (developed under the GHG
Protocol Initiative, and currently being pilot‐tested). ISO also has plans to develop a
carbon footprint standard.
Incentives at the state level may take the form of tax credits, preferential state
purchasing, recognition/promotion, and/or regulatory relief.
Mandates would require certain products sold into Oregon (regardless of location of
production) to have an associated carbon footprint and/or label. This could be viewed
as a form of product stewardship.

Lead: Standards, incentives, and mandates would be most efficient if harmonized nationally. Lacking a
national standard, Oregon could request the Western Climate Initiative to develop a harmonized carbon
footprinting and/or labeling initiative. There might be an opportunity to involve other regional climate
groups (RGGI, Midwest GHG Reduction Accord) in this effort. Alternatively, the Global Warming
Commission could sponsor/convene an Oregon working group to study alternatives and recommend an
approach to implementing this recommendation, or the Legislature could commission a study. DEQ
could also research approaches as a product stewardship initiative (see recommendation #5).
Type of Action: Standard, Incentives, Regulation
Timing of Impact: Carbon footprinting (and very limited labeling) is already underway in the US, and
some US companies have experience with footprinting because of labeling requirements in France,
Japan, and Sweden, and initiatives in the UK and elsewhere. However, a uniform state or regional
initiative developed in the short term (1‐5 years) would probably not be fully implemented until the
medium‐ (5‐10 years) or long‐term (10+ years).
GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0. 18 – 1.89 million MTCO2e in 2020 for voluntary approaches with
incentives. 26 Approximately 0. 71– 3.31 million MTCO2e in 2020 for limited mandatory approaches. 27
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes. An evaluation by The Carbon Trust (UK) of 20 leading companies that pilot‐
tested the draft PAS 2050 footprint standard found that carbon footprinting helped some companies to
identify opportunities to reduce energy use.
Cost (Savings)? Administrative costs to develop and implement incentives and/or regulations; costs of
incentives; costs to businesses to conduct and report carbon footprints. Carbon footprinting also
identifies opportunities for cost reductions (savings) associated with supply chain management and
procurement, energy consumption, product transport, and waste.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
Comments: The Carbon Trust report (2008) identified the following benefits to businesses that
developed carbon footprints:

•

Revealed true sources and drivers of emissions, leading to more effective carbon
reduction strategies.

26Two estimates of emissions associated with the life cycle of materials (excluding use) are developed.

The first draws on
EPA and Carnegie Mellon University research that suggests that production, transport, and disposal of materials used in
the US contribute emissions (some overseas) equal to 49% of the domestic GHG inventory. This is applied to Oregon’s
GHG inventory (2005) and scaled upward to 2020 for an estimate of 41.1 million mTCO2e. Alternatively, DEQ’s
preliminary draft consumption‐based emissions inventory (unpublished) estimates life cycle emissions (excluding use) of
materials consumed in Oregon; scaling upward to 2020 results in an estimate of 33.9 million mTCO2e. These provide a
low and high estimate of materials‐related GHG emissions. Low and high assumptions are then made about the
percentage of these emissions that might be represented by products for which carbon footprints/labels are developed
(5‐20% for voluntary initiatives with incentives) and the resulting reduction in product‐level GHG emissions (10‐20%).
For reference, a 2008 evaluation by The Carbon Trust (UK) of 20 leading companies that pilot‐tested the draft PAS 2050
footprint standard found that some companies were able to quickly reduce product‐level GHG emissions by 15‐20%. Low
and high estimates are then scaled upwards by 5‐15% (respectively) to account for additional emissions reduction
potential not included in the base estimate of materials‐related emissions. These include product use emissions (for
example, if producers reformulate laundry detergents to work well in cold water, or consumers improve maintenance of
proper tire pressure, etc.), forest carbon impacts, and indirect land use impacts.
27 Mandatory approaches are evaluated using a framework similar to incentives (above), except that we assume 40‐70%
of materials‐related emissions are associated with products for which footprinting/labeling is required, and that these
producers of these products reduce product‐level GHG emissions by 5‐10%.

Identified and implemented high‐impact cost‐saving opportunities across the supply
chain.
Built stronger, more collaborative relationships with suppliers.
Developed better management practices in general.

Also, to the extent that domestically‐produced goods have lower GHG footprints than competing goods
produced elsewhere (this is true in some although not all instances), carbon labeling would provide an
advantage to domestic producers.

5. Focus product stewardship on upstream emissions, and design for
appropriate durability, repairability, reusability, efficiency, and recovery
Summary: Product stewardship is an environmental management strategy in which all parties involved
in the design, production, sale and use of a product take responsibility for minimizing the product’s
environmental impact throughout all stages of the product’s life. The greatest responsibility lies with
whoever has the most ability to affect the life cycle environmental impacts of the product.
Recent examples of product stewardship in Oregon are the Oregon E‐Cycles program and the PaintCare
program. While both of these examples focus on the stewardship of products at end‐of‐life, there is
strong interest in applying product stewardship principles to the full life cycle of products, particularly
where upstream impacts are large. Recommendation #4 (carbon footprinting, labeling), above, is an
example of product stewardship incorporating an “upstream” focus.
Oregon should apply the principle of product stewardship to mandate reductions in full life cycle
greenhouse gas emissions, upstream and downstream. In most cases, upstream emissions dominate, so
the focus of this recommendation is primarily upstream (in contrast to recommendation #28, which
focuses downstream).28 The policy might also mandate or incent “upstream” design changes by
producers that reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions through changes such as making products
more durable, repairable, reusable, or efficient. While these attributes generally reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, care must be given to optimizing actual emissions reductions; for example, designing a
product to last for 50 years when the average consumer replaces it every 5 years may actually increase
emissions. So while these attributes should inform policy, the policy should be designed to achieve a
holistic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
The details of this policy approach are undefined but should be developed as the next step in
implementing this recommendation. At the highest and simplest level, one conceptual example involves
requiring producers of stewarded products to evaluate the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions
associated with their product (see recommendation #4), and then to achieve an emissions reduction
goal by a certain date in the future.
Lead: Oregon Legislature, DEQ
Type of Action: Regulation
Timing of Impact: Probably medium‐ (5‐10 years) or long‐term (10+ years) given the foundational work
required to achieve a large change.
28 For example, among domestic GHG emissions, roughly 42% of emissions are associated with the life cycle (excluding

use) of products and other materials; less than 2% (of the total) are associated with end‐of‐life management; the
remaining 40% are “upstream,” associated with production and transport.

GHG Savings? Yes. Potentially 0.04 – 0.45 million MTCO2e in 2020. 29 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.05 – 0.46

6. Establish higher standards for new buildings: “net zero” plus offset of
materials
Summary: “Net zero” energy buildings are those that produce all of the operational energy used by the
building in any given year. The State should establish higher standards for new buildings, combining net
zero operational energy with a carbon offset program to account for the life cycle GHG impacts of the
materials used in the building.
Lead: Oregon Legislature; Building Codes Division, with support from ODOE and DEQ.
Type of Action: Regulation
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG savings? Approximately 7.25 MMTCO2e in 2020. 30
Fossil Fuel Savings: Yes, not evaluated.
Cost (savings?): There will be a significant cost premium for constructing these buildings, but over time,
there is also likely to be substantial cost savings associated with eliminating utility costs.
Cost effectiveness: Unknown.
Comments: As an alternative to requiring “net zero,” the State and possibly local governments might
incent it through tax credits and/or other means.

7. Provide information and outreach to consumers on product impacts and
opportunities to reduce those impacts.
Summary: Some Oregonians seek information on how they can reduce their personal (or businesses’)
contribution to global warming. The choice of products, as well as how those products are used,
contributes significantly to global warming, and so should be part of any outreach effort by the State.

29According to the rough model of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of materials and wastes developed by DEQ for this
report, the broad categories of materials contributing the most to life cycle GHG emissions are (in order)
computers/monitors, food, carpet/rugs, newspaper, plastic products, and tires. These top six categories contribute
roughly 4.5 million MTCO2e in life cycle emissions (excluding emissions associated with use). (Expressed on the basis of
emissions per ton of waste generated, the highest‐impact materials are [in order]: computers/monitors, tires,
carpet/rugs, other rubber products, food, and steel cans. These top six categories contribute roughly 4.1 million MTCO2e
in life cycle emissions.) A reduction in these emissions in the range of 1‐10% would reduce emissions by 0.04 – 0.45
million MTCO2e in 2020.
30The energy and materials‐related impacts for all buildings from 2013 were estimated to stay neutral through 2020. All
new buildings built between 2013 and 2020 are modeled as having no energy‐ or materials‐related impacts.

Outreach can take several forms. The Global Warming Commission, along with state agencies, can
provide information on how different products contribute to global warming, and what some of the
opportunities are to reduce those impacts. Other organizations might take a more active role in
promoting specific actions. Where appropriate, outreach should use principles of social marketing (e.g.,
the use of commitments and norms), and highlight co‐benefits.
Lead: Global Warming Commission; potential roles for various agencies
Type of Action: Education
Timing of Impact: Effective in the short‐term (1‐5 years) but may take longer to achieve full potential.
GHG Savings? Yes. Potentially 0.02 – 0.71 million MTCO2e in 2020. 31
Fossil Fuel Savings? Likely yes; not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Yes, to operate an effective outreach effort.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
Comments: This recommendation includes changes in both food‐ and non‐food consumer behavior.
Specific to food, opportunities to reduce emissions associated with over‐purchasing of food (production
of food that goes uneaten) is evaluated separately, as recommendation #8. It is worth noting that the
total number of calories the average American consumes daily has increased by about 18% over the last
30 years. High levels of consumption impact both the environment and health. Other organizations
(such as those in public health) are already developing strategies to reduce overconsumption (primarily
focused on “bad” calories such as fats and sugars). Climate protection is an important potential co‐
benefit of moderate, healthful consumption. Shifts in diets will also impact both the climate and the
health of people consuming the food. As such, proposed changes in food choices need to be evaluated
in the context of the nutritional and other benefits provided by foods. For example, a shift in
consumption from lean beef to bacon might reduce GHG emissions, but have unwanted health impacts.
Conversely, a shift from other foods to vegetables would, on average, reduce emissions and rates of

31Low and high estimates are developed for both food and non‐food products.

For non‐food consumption, the evaluation
begins with the low and high estimates of materials‐related emissions derived for recommendation #1, discounted to
remove emissions associated with food. 78% of consumption‐based emissions in Oregon are estimated to be associated
with household consumption, according to DEQ’s draft consumption‐based emissions inventory research. The food‐
discounted estimates are scaled accordingly. For the low estimate for non‐food products, we assume market penetration
to 1% of Oregon households and per‐household reductions (of non‐food materials‐related emissions) of 5%. For the high
estimate, we assume market penetration to 20% of Oregon households and per‐household reductions of 10%. For food‐
related consumer changes, we review the GHG reduction potential associated with three different scenarios. The first
models a moderate (~14%) per‐capita reduction in consumption of meat, with the equivalent calories (accounting for
2.2% of total caloric intake) equally redistributed to higher consumption of grains and vegetables. Meat, for the purposes
of this scenario, includes all meats. The second scenario models an overall reduction in caloric intake by 10% ‐ 20%,
distributed evenly across all food categories. The third scenario involves shifting 10% of total calories from food
categories with above‐average GHG emissions/calorie to food categories with below‐average GHG emissions/calorie.
From these evaluations, a low‐impact and high‐impact potential are identified. (The scenario where some meat is
replaced with grains and vegetables is the lowest‐impact measure, at ~0.4 MMTCO2e; the shift of 10% calories is the
highest‐impact measure, at ~1.6 MMTCO2e; 10% and 20% across‐the‐board reductions in caloric intake represent ~0.7
and ~1.4 MMTCO2e emissions reduction potential. Interestingly, maintaining a constant caloric intake but shifting 10%
of calories from high‐ to low‐carbon foods leads to a larger emissions reduction than even a 20% across‐the‐board
reduction in caloric intake.) The low and high potentials are multiplied by 1% and 20%, respectively, as a range of likely
participation/adoption rates. Non‐food and food‐related estimates are then summed together for a total. Potential
reductions in use‐phase emissions are not included in these estimates.

obesity, with significant co‐benefits in reduced health costs (estimated at $781 million in 2003 for
obesity‐related medical costs in Oregon 32 ).

8. Reduce (prevent) waste of food at the retail and consumer level by 5‐50%
Summary: By one estimate, food waste in the US has increased from 30% of the available food supply in
1974 to almost 40% in recent years; in 1974, approximately 900 kcal per person per day was wasted,
whereas in 2003 Americans wasted ~1,400 kcal per person per day. 33 The majority of food waste occurs
at the consumer level. Some food waste is composed of the non‐edible portions of food, but there is
also a significant amount of edible food wasted. Reducing (preventing) the waste of food reduces GHG
emissions across the entire life cycle.
Meal planning, food storage, and proper food preparation practices are some ways to reduce food
waste. At the retail level (including both markets and food service operations), better forecasting,
inventory control, food storage, portion control, and reutilization offer opportunities to reduce food
waste.
An effective strategy to reduce food waste first requires a better understanding of the causes of food
waste. The literature suggests dozens of different reasons, from social norms and financial pressures
faced by consumers to agricultural subsidies creating a “supply push” effect, whereby increased food
availability and marketing results in Americans being unable to match their food intake with the
increased supply of cheap, readily available food. As a first step, the State should undertake additional
research to better understand the root causes of food waste and better evaluate actions the state and
others could take to reduce it. The State should then implement new programs, as informed by this
research, to reduce the waste of food.

GHG savings? Yes. Approximately 0.12‐1.13 MMTCO2e in 2020. 34 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.12 – 1.19
MMTCO2e in 2020.)
Fossil Fuel Savings: Yes. By one estimate, the energy required to produce the food that is subsequently
wasted in the US is equivalent to ~300 million barrels of oil per year.
Cost (savings?): Yes. Less waste may mean slightly less food is purchased.
Cost effectiveness: Unknown

Impact. PLoS ONE 4(11): e7940. Doi:10.1371/journalpone.0007940.
34 This scenario provides an estimate of the benefits of reducing food waste between 5‐50%.

Full life cycle emissions for
these wasted foods are included (not just waste disposal emissions, which tend to be small relative to production), as the
reduction in waste is assumed to be a result of reduced over‐purchasing. 50 percent was used as the upper bound
because the exact quantity of edible vs. non‐edible food waste is unknown.

Comments: Some strategies to reduce food waste may also result in health co‐benefits. Reducing food
waste (overproduction) will also reduce the many other environmental impacts associated with
agriculture and food processing.

9. Conduct research on highest/best use for organic wastes and waste to
energy and the carbon impact of different conversion technologies
Summary: The State should conduct, or support, three related but separate research projects. First,
there should be a review of methods (aerobic composting, anaerobic composting, anaerobic digestion,
wastewater disposal, landfill disposal, incineration, etc.) for managing organic wastes. The evaluation
would consider both greenhouse gas impacts as well as other environmental considerations. This
evaluation would inform a variety of policy and program efforts, including future discussions on a
potential ban on landfilling of putrescible wastes such as food. 35 Second, there should be a review and
evaluation of the greenhouse gas impact of conversion technologies (pyrolysis, gasification, etc.),
including a comparison of the impacts to other disposal and recovery options. Third the state should
develop guidelines and recommendations for appropriate use of waste to energy technologies that
protect the environment and health and avoid unintended consequences. This information would help
guide policy and program development by state and local agencies, and would also inform investment
decisions by industry.

APPENDIX C
Tier Two Recommendations
10.

Change BETC from an energy tax credit to a carbon (life cycle) reduction tax credit

Summary: Oregon’s Business Energy Tax Credit currently provides an incentive to certain business activities that reduce
energy consumption in Oregon. One of the co‐benefits is a reduction in GHG emissions. However, the criteria exclude
other projects in Oregon that might reduce GHG emissions via non‐energy pathways (e.g., methane destruction, or
reductions in nitrous oxide emissions) or from materials management practices in Oregon that reduce fossil energy
consumption upstream in the life cycle, but outside of Oregon.
A workgroup should evaluate how BETC could be reoriented from an energy tax credit to a “GHG reduction tax credit.”
Recommendations should be made to the Legislature and ODOE for consideration.
Lead: Oregon Legislature, Oregon Department of Energy
Type of Action: Incentives
Timing of Impact: Likely medium‐term (5‐10 years).
GHG Savings? Potentially yes, but not evaluated.
Fossil Fuel Savings? Not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Not evaluated.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
11.

Provide funding and resources necessary to achieve existing statutory prevention and recovery goals

Summary: Both waste prevention (“reduce, reuse”) and waste recovery (recycling, composting, and some forms of
energy recovery) offer potential for GHG reductions.
For recovery, the existing statutory goal is 50% recovery in 2009. The State’s recovery rate has hovered in the range of
46.3% ‐ 49.2% between 2001 and 2009. The State’s rate in 2009 was 48.4%, just shy of the goal. This goal has since
expired but may be renewed or revised by the Legislature.
The statutory goal for waste prevention is no increase in total waste generation in 2009 and all subsequent years.
Waste generation is the sum of recovery and disposal; it is a measure of all materials discarded into the recovery/solid
waste system, and a very crude measure of material consumption. Because the goal is expressed in absolute terms,
increasing population requires that per‐capita generation decline. (Although the goal is expressed in terms of waste
generation, achievement of the goal requires waste prevention, so it is referred to here as a “waste prevention goal.”)
Generation rose steadily until 2006 and has declined since then, so the State achieved this goal in 2009 – although a
return to economic growth may generate countervailing “headwinds” that make this goal more difficult to maintain.
The State has been unable to achieve 50% recovery, and lacks resources necessary to maintain downward pressure on
per‐capita waste generation. Funding should be provided as necessary to meet these goals.
Lead: Oregon Legislature
Type of Action: Tax/Fee, used to fund Incentives, Education, Regulation
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).

GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.13 million MTCO2e in 2020 if a recovery rate of 50% is achieved (relative to the
baseline scenario of ~48%). 38 Approximately 1.15 million MTCO2e in 2020 if total waste generation in 2020 does not
exceed waste generation in 2008. 39 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.16 MMTCO2e in 2020 for recovery; 1.56 MMTCO2e in 2020
for generation/prevention.)
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes; not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Yes. Not evaluated.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
12.

Shift from a “waste management” to a “materials management” focus and give consideration to
greenhouse gas reduction potentials, when updating the state’s “Integrated Resource & Solid Waste
Management Plan”

Summary: Oregon’s “Integrated Resource & Solid Waste Management Plan” expired in 2005. DEQ has plans to update
or rewrite the plan in the near future. As the Materials Management Committee’s evaluation of alternatives for the
Global Warming Commission illustrates, the frame of “materials management” offers the potential for much larger
climate protection benefit than the traditional frame of “waste management.” The existing policy framework that DEQ
operates under – which is tied to the solid waste management hierarchy – at times constrains DEQ’s ability to work for
optimal protection of the environment. The Global Warming Commission should express to DEQ and the Environmental
Quality Commission (which will adopt the new plan) its interest that DEQ shift focus from “waste management” to
“materials management” and give consideration to greenhouse gas reduction potentials.
Lead: DEQ, Environmental Quality Commission
Type of Action: Planning
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Not evaluated.
Fossil Fuel Savings? Not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Policy shift: no. Implementation: possibly.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
Comments: Such a shift would be generally consistent with policy shifts underway at the federal level, for example, EPA’s
reports Beyond RCRA: Waste and Materials Management in the Year 2020 (commonly called “the 2020 Vision”) and
Sustainable Materials Management: The Road Ahead. 40
13.

Include the cost of GHG emissions in policy­making considerations (e.g. ,“economic test” for recycling)

Summary: Some policy decisions mandate the use of economic evaluation. An example is the “economic test” that is
used to determine if materials must be collected for curbside recycling in different areas of the state. Rule and/or
statute could be revised to clarify that the determination of whether an action is “economic” or not should be viewed
broadly as “economic to society,” as opposed to narrowly (e.g., “impact on collection service rates”). The impact of GHG
38This was estimated by increasing recycling, composting (for yard and food waste), and energy recovery (for wood waste and tires)

tonnages for a variety of different materials until the recovery goal was achieved. Tonnage increases were based on professional judgment
regarding the “recovery potential” for different materials. An overall tonnage increase necessary to achieve the state goal was allocated
across individual materials in proportion to the margin between recovery tonnages at current recovery rates and recovery tonnages under
the “recovery potential” scenario. Thus, materials with large gaps between current and potential recovery (such as food waste and wood
waste) were assumed to contribute more tonnage towards achieving the goal.
39This may underestimate the potential benefit of prevention due to limitations in data and modeling.
40 See http://www.epa.gov/wastes/inforesources/pubs/vision.htm.

emissions should be monetized (expressed in terms of dollars based on cost to society) and included in economic
decisions that inform policy implementation.
Lead: Oregon Legislature, Environmental Quality Commission, and/or DEQ
Type of Action: Regulation
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Yes, but not evaluated. An example of a likely change would be to require more curbside programs to add
scrap metal to their list of materials accepted.
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes; not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Some administrative costs; may add to costs passed to ratepayers.
Cost/Effectiveness? Yes, by definition.
Comments: This recommendation is consistent with a recommendation from the 2004 Governor’s Advisory Group on
Global Warming, which said “The State should create incentives that will contribute to achievement of the waste
generation and recovery goals in a cost‐effective manner. ‘Cost effectiveness’ should recognize all costs, including
externalities, and quantify them where possible.”
See also recommendation #31 for another example of how this policy might be implemented.
14.

Initiate state and local government low­carbon purchasing requirements (including buildings)

Summary: The Oregon Legislature should revise statute and direct state government to give preference to products and
services that have a demonstrated lower‐carbon impact across the full life cycle. This preference could be expressed as
a price preference or in some other form.
Given the diversity of products and services purchased, a phased approach is most appropriate. The Department of
Administrative Services should identify categories of products with high GHG emissions potential. (DEQ’s Consumption‐
Based Emissions Inventory, currently under development, may be very helpful in this task.) A process should be
established for requiring potential vendors of products in high‐impact categories to report full or partial life cycle GHG
emissions, using a reporting standard (such as PAS 2050, or the new GHG Protocol product life cycle standard; see also
recommendation #4), to be determined by the State. Reporting may be optional for several years in order to give
industry time to prepare. Over time, additional product categories should be added. Whole‐building life cycle analysis
may be required for construction projects over a certain size.
DAS might work with sister agencies in other states to implement this information‐gathering system. Results should be
shared with other state agencies and local governments. Other state agencies (including the Oregon University System)
should be required to participate. Local governments (including school districts?) could be required to participate as a
condition of receiving state funds over a certain amount.
To be effective, the Legislature will need to specify a level of emphasis given to GHG emissions in purchasing decisions
(so that it isn’t an optional or minor consideration). The policy would be strengthened further by requiring periodic
reporting of results, perhaps expressed in the context of an expanded state government operations GHG inventory that
includes “scope 3” emissions associated with purchased goods.
Lead: Oregon Legislature, Department of Administrative Services; support by DEQ; implementation by all agencies
Type of Action: Regulation, Information
Timing of Impact: Effective in the short‐term (1‐5 years), but will require longer (~10 years?) to achieve full potential.

GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.01 – 0.11 million MTCO2e in 2020. 41
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes (related to GHG savings), but not quantified.
Cost (Savings)? Not estimated. Depends on price premium (if any), administrative costs (to state and local
governments), and compliance costs by potential contractors. Some labor costs required (DAS and possibly supporting
role at DEQ, plus involvement by other agency procurement staff) to implement this effectively.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not estimated.
Comments: State government “leads by example.” A well‐organized state purchasing initiative might spur private‐sector
innovation and also provide valuable information to other institutional and business purchasers.
15.

Conduct research to evaluate alternative economic models (e.g., steady­state, sustainable)

Summary: Although the Committee’s charge was to focus on materials management (and not consumption more
broadly), the demand‐side focus of the Committee led to several discussions about consumption, and whether or not
ever‐increasing consumption (expressed as “economic growth”) is in fact sustainable (not to mention whether it would
allow the state’s GHG goals to be achieved). Several leading economists (as well as the government of France) are
engaged in the evaluation of “steady‐state” economics, to determine under what circumstances such a model could
provide for society’s needs and what other impacts it would have on society.
The Global Warming Commission should convene – or support – a state or regional panel to review existing research
into “steady‐state” economic models and evaluate them for their potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions, and
potential policy ramifications.
Lead: Global Warming Commission
Type of Action: Research
Timing of Impact: Review could be conducted in the short‐term (1‐5 years), with results applied beginning immediately
but likely most impact would occur later.
GHG Savings? Not evaluated; potentially very large depending on results.
Fossil Fuel Savings? Not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Not evaluated.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
16.

Create or advocate for a “do­not­mail” registry (unwanted mail)

Summary: This idea is modeled on the “do‐not‐call” registry, which Oregon created and which was then supplanted by a
federal registry. In this option, Oregonians should be given an opportunity to sign up for a “do‐not‐mail” registry.
Mailers of unsolicited commercial materials would then be prohibited from mailing these households.
41

Once completed, DEQ’s CBEI‐LCA model will be able to estimate the life cycle GHG emissions associated with state and local government
procurement. In the meantime, we use as a proxy an estimate of the “scope 3” supply chain emissions for the Oregon University System (OUS) in
2008. Using Carnegie Mellon’s EIOLCA tool, these were estimated by Good Company to be 244,000 MT CO2e based on expenditures of $612
million. This results in an emissions intensity of 379 MTCO2e/million dollars. While the emissions intensity for broader state and local government
materials purchases may be different, we use this is a first‐order estimate, and multiply it by estimated 2005 state and local expenditures of $2.4
billion for goods (excluding direct purchase of fuels) and construction services and materials, for an estimated 2005 emissions of 0.93 million
MTCO2e associated with producing and transporting goods and construction services purchased by state and local governments in Oregon. (This
excludes emissions associated with the use of products, as well as most other services.) This should be viewed as a very rough estimate. Assuming
that these emissions grow proportional with population to 2020, a 1‐10% reduction in emissions resulting from this action would reduce emissions
by 0.01 – 0.11 million MTCO2e in 2020. These GHG savings estimates do not include potential savings associated with energy efficiency attributes
(use‐phase emissions).

17.

Create incentives, regulations to reduce carbon impacts of packaging

Summary: The State should create incentives or regulations that would reduce the carbon impacts of packaging. 44
Reductions could be realized through source reduction (lightweighting), reuse, recycling, or changing to lower‐carbon
materials. The exact nature and scope of these incentives or regulations would need further study. This might take the
form of product stewardship (see recommendation #5).
Lead: Oregon Legislature, DEQ
Type of Action: Incentives and/or Regulations
Timing of Impact: Probably medium‐ (5‐10 years) or long‐term (10+ years), given the foundational work required to
achieve a large change.
GHG Savings? Yes. Potentially 0.02 – 0.09 million MTCO2e in 2020. 45
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes.
Cost (Savings)? Not evaluated.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
42 EPA estimates generation of 5,510 million tons of standard (third class) mail in the US in 2008.

This is pro‐rated to Oregon and assumed
to maintain a constant per‐capita generation rate through 2020. For a low estimate, we assume that the registry only covers households,
that 70% of the mass of mail is sent to households, 25% participate, and their mail delivery (third class mail) drops by 60%. For a high
estimate, we assume that the registry covers both households and businesses, that 50% participate, and their mail delivery (third class mail)
drops by 80%. For reference, one survey in 2007 found a 77% participation rate in the national do‐not‐call registry (see Box 9‐1 of the
Economic Report of the President, 2009).
43 Not included in this estimate is the potentially much larger changes in GHG reductions that may occur if the reduction of advertising mail
causes households to shift or reduce purchases of consumer goods. This could work to increase or decrease GHG emissions and may merit
additional research.
44 Including but not limited to retail single‐use take‐out bags; see recommendation #18.
45 Based on EPA estimates of waste generation of packaging in 2008, pro‐rated to Oregon and scaled upward to 2020, assuming constant
per‐capita generation. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for Oregon’s share of national packaging use are estimated at 470,000 metric
tons CO2e in 2020 (1.40 million MTCO2e for production, credits of 0.93 million MTCO2e for recycling, and a very small credit for disposal).
Interestingly, packaging contributes only 8% of estimated GHGs for all municipal waste generation in 2020, even as it contributes roughly
16% to Oregon’s solid waste by weight. Potential GHG reductions for this recommendation are estimated as 5‐20% reductions across all
packaging‐related GHGs. To put this in context, Wal‐Mart is considering a performance goal for its packaging sustainability initiative
whereby the production‐related GHG intensity (emissions per unit of sale) of packaging decreases 5‐10%.

Comments: For many products, the “carbon footprint” of packaging is considerably lower than the impact of the product
itself. To the extent that packaging protects the product from damage during transport and storage, care must be taken
to avoid reducing or changing packaging in a manner that is “penny wise and pound foolish,” causing higher rates of
product damage.

Reduce use of single­use retail carry­out bags; ban plastic single­use bags

Summary: The State should ban the use of single‐use plastic carry‐out bags and require a five‐cent fee on all single‐use
carry‐out bags distributed by retailers. The fee would incent customers to bring their own bags.
Lead: Oregon Legislature
Type of Action: Regulation, Incentive
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Possibly yes; preliminary evaluation inconclusive. 46
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes; not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Expected to be minimal.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
Comments: Reducing plastic bag use will also address concerns with litter, impacts on marine life, and contamination at
compost facilities. It will also reduce processing losses and contamination at recycling sorting facilities, with resulting
benefits for end‐markets (manufacturers) of recycled materials (see recommendation #27).
19.

Identify low­carbon methods of home food production, then increase adoption of these methods

Summary: Home food production can potentially reduce the carbon impacts of an individual’s diet. The level of
reduction, if any, is highly dependent upon gardening practices. Overall, the reduction in machinery use and electricity
use can achieve the biggest carbon reductions for home gardening. Other factors that can affect the level of benefit for
this practice are the type of compost used, fertilizer use, building garden beds, driving distances avoided or incurred,
percent of garden produced food wasted, and method, quantity and efficiency of home food‐preserving techniques.
Initially, the State should conduct or support research to evaluate the carbon impact of home food production, to
compare it against commercial food production, and to identify which variables are particularly impactful as well as
recommended best practices for low‐carbon at‐home food production.
Lead: Unknown. Potential roles for OSU Extension Service (research, dissemination of results), Master Gardener
Programs (outreach).
Type of Action: Initially Research, then potentially Education, Incentives
Timing of Impact: Potentially effective in the short‐term (1‐5 years) but will take longer to achieve full potential.
GHG savings? Unknown.
Fossil Fuel Savings: Unknown.
Cost (savings?): Unknown.

46Evaluation by DEQ and the Materials Management Committee proved to be inconclusive, due to significant uncertainty and variability.

Major sources of uncertainty and variability include: the overall rate of reduction in carry‐out bag use; the rate at which carry‐out bags are
replaced with the purchase of plastic bags for other uses (for example, by consumers seeking plastic bags as trash can liners); forest carbon
impacts associated with potential for increased wood harvesting; number and type of reusable bags purchased and rate and manner of
washing them; and impacts on material recovery facilities (MRFs) and recycling losses.

Create/require a carbon footprint score for buildings, including materials

Summary: In the 2009 Oregon Legislative Session, Senate Bill 79 proposed that an Energy Performance Score (EPS) be
attributed to any new or existing home being sold in Oregon. The EPS was proposed as akin to a “miles‐per‐gallon”
energy rating for homes that rated the total operational energy consumption of a home on a common scale. The intent
was that home owners have a means of understanding the energy impact of a home, and that efficiency upgrades and
operating costs be included in the value of a home. The mandatory EPS portion of SB 79 was rejected and a task force
comprised of a diverse set of members was set up to study the potential of both a voluntary and mandatory EPS
program. The task force report is expected to be presented to the Legislature in 2011. A pilot program, led by the
Energy Trust, is still in pilot stage as of September 2010.
This scenario extends this concept to include the materials used for home construction and maintenance (replacement
of roofs, windows, carpet, etc.). The revised EPS should include the carbon footprint of both operational energy and
materials consumption to more fully reflect the life cycle impacts of buildings – specifically, the materials used to make
them.

Oregon Legislature.

Type of Action: Regulation
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG savings? Approximately 0.43 MMTCO2e in 2020. 47

Cost (savings?): Possible savings over time through avoided utility costs, but not evaluated.
Cost effectiveness: Unknown
21.

Provide incentives for lower­carbon building materials

Summary: Typically, over the 50‐100 year lifetime of average residential and commercial buildings, the impacts of
original and replacement materials production account for roughly 15% of the GHG emissions. As our buildings become
more operationally energy efficient due to more stringent building codes, high utility costs, and consumer demand, the
relative impact of materials production may become even greater. Additionally, many efficiency upgrades to buildings
involve using more materials (e.g., insulation). Therefore, the State should provide some form of incentive (currently
undefined, but see recommendation #10) that reduces the life cycle GHG impacts of construction materials by 20%.
The exact nature and scope of these incentives would need further study. This might take the form of product
stewardship.
Lead: Unknown. Possible roles for Oregon Legislature, Global Warming Commission, DEQ, DOE, others.
Type of Action: Incentives and/or Regulations
Timing of Impact: Probably medium‐ (5‐10 years) or long‐term (10+ years).
GHG savings? Approximately 0.34 ‐ 1.72 MMTCO2e in 2020. 48

47 This scenario assumes that all new homes constructed between 2013 and 2020 are 10% more efficient than the average Oregon home

today. Additionally, 25% of all existing homes sold between 2013‐2020 will be 25% more efficient in energy and materials emissions due to
EPS‐prompted efficiency upgrades.

Encourage/incent changes in urban form

Summary: The structure of our urban areas affects housing, food, transportation, and land use, among other things.
Generally, increasing density in urban centers is thought to decrease GHG emissions from housing (including materials),
transportation, and land use conversions. Oregon has been progressive in establishing urban growth boundaries, which
are aligned with increasing density in urban areas and preserving farm and forest land. To that extent, the State and
local governments should support and implement policy changes to increase density in urban areas, decrease the rate of
new construction, increase density in existing structures, increase use of small accessory dwelling units, and incent a
reduction in the size of housing units.
Lead: Possibly DCLD and local governments.
Type of Action: Incentives and/or Regulations
Timing of Impact: Effective in the Short‐term (1‐5 years) but will require longer to achieve full potential.
GHG savings? Approximately 0.98 MMTCO2e in 2020, not including reductions in transportation‐related emissions.49
Fossil Fuel Savings: Yes, not evaluated.
Cost (savings?): Yes, not evaluated. Smaller homes cost less money to build, operate, and maintain.
Cost effectiveness: Likely high.
23.

Change code: larger homes must also be more energy­efficient

Summary: Large homes consume more energy and materials than smaller homes built to the same level of efficiency.
The State should require a more stringent building code for both operational energy and materials related energy
impacts of large homes. For example, three tiers of homes could be created; any home below 1,950 square feet only
would need to meet the standard building code. Homes 1,950‐2,850 square feet would be required to be built 20%
more energy and materially efficient than a smaller code home. Homes over 2,850 square feet would be required to be
40% more energy and materially efficient than a smaller code home.
This tiered building code is not a new concept. The City of Boulder, CO has had a similarly structured code in place since
1996. Additionally, the recent revisions to Washington State’s residential building code include a similar provision
related to home size and efficiency.
Lead: Oregon Building Codes Division.

48 Carbon intensity of building material production reduced between 5‐25% for all building materials purchased for use in Oregon in 2020.

Since not all building materials consumed in Oregon are produced in Oregon, the production‐based Oregon GHG inventory may not reflect
reductions to the degree estimated here.
49 Estimated by assuming that new construction between 2014‐2020 decreases by 20% each year to account for people pursuing housing
within the existing housing stock. The GHG reduction potential is discounted by 50% because of the increased impacts felt on the existing
stock (e.g., more people using electricity in a home) or new accessory dwelling units being constructed and occupied. Additionally, all new
housing is modeled as if it were 1200 square feet in size (both multi‐family and single‐family), which increases density and reduces the life
cycle impacts of the new residences’ materials and energy by approximately 50% compared with the average newly constructed home in
Oregon. This scenario does not include any increases in building efficiency, but simply shows the benefits of adding density to the existing
stock and decreasing the size of newly constructed homes. Benefits of increased density (on transportation‐related emissions) are not
included in this estimate.

Fossil Fuel Savings: Yes, not evaluated.
Cost (savings?): Unknown.

Comments: While building codes are one method to incent smaller houses and efficiency improvements at larger
houses, another means to do this is through a progressive building fee structure. However, state standards restrict the
ability of local governments to offer progressive fees. When local governments are required to set permit fees based on
the value of a building or retrofit, it disincents capital improvements (such as efficient HVAC units) that have higher up‐
front costs.
24.

Require all State construction (including Institutional) to apply the State Energy Efficient Design
program to materials

Summary: The State Energy Efficient Design (SEED) is a State of Oregon program administered by the Oregon
Department of Energy that applies to all state agencies and state higher education institutions that are authorized to
finance the construction, purchase or renovation of buildings or other structures to be used by the State of Oregon. It is
not an optional program. SEED requires that buildings exceed the energy conservation provisions of the Oregon State
building code by 20 percent or more.
The State should require that the materials‐related impacts of SEED buildings also be 20% below a typical code building,
or alternatively, be compensated through even higher GHG reductions associated with energy during occupancy, so that
the life cycle energy impacts (or GHG impacts) of the whole building (energy + materials) represent a 20% improvement
when compared to code.
Lead: Oregon Department of Energy
Type of Action: Standard
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG savings? Approximately 0.02 MMTCO2e in 2020. 51
Fossil Fuel Savings: Yes, not evaluated.
Cost (savings?): Unknown.
Cost effectiveness: Unknown.
50The code change is enacted in 2013. All new homes built in 2014 or later are affected. Medium‐sized homes (1950‐2850 square feet) need

to be 20% more energy and materials efficient than code and large homes (>2850 square feet) need to be 40% more energy and materials
efficient than code. The estimate was made based on the reductions gained relative to a 2008 average code house. The benefits may be
higher as/if energy code becomes more efficient. There are currently no standards in building code for the embodied energy efficiency of
building materials. Foundational work from other recommendations (such as #20 and #21) could help establish performance guidelines for
materials efficiency.
51This scenario is estimated by taking the State portion of commercial materials‐related emissions in 2020 and reducing them by 20%. The
State portion of material‐related emissions is estimated by first estimating the proportion of government‐related commercial material
emissions using gross demand (in dollars) data from the 2005 IMPLAN database. That portion is then further divided into state and local
emissions by proportioning the value according to number of employees in state and local government. The employment data was simply
used a proxy for the proportion of money (and emissions) spent on buildings.

Expand/incentivize infrastructure for salvaged goods, use of salvaged materials

Summary: Salvage is the act of recovering a material for reuse without any reprocessing or change in the material’s
identity. Reuse is the act of using a salvaged material. The acts of salvage and reuse are complementary and are
evaluated together in this scenario. By reusing materials, one decreases the demand for new (virgin) materials and
thereby eliminates all of the impacts of producing and transporting that material. While reuse can have significant
benefits for some materials, the act of salvage and reuse of building materials can also have impacts if the material is
transported far distances, has decreased durability, or takes more energy or time to salvage or use. The State should
expand the reuse and salvage infrastructure, and provide incentives for reuse and salvage. This scenario estimates the
potential benefit of a high rate of salvage for 25% of all residential and commercial buildings in 2020. Finally, this
practice does have its practical limitations in that an increase in the demand for salvaged materials must be met with an
increase in supply from deconstructed or remodeled buildings.
Lead: Unknown
Type of Action: Incentives, possibly Regulation
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG savings? Approximately 0.02 ‐ 0.07 MMTCO2e in 2020. 52
Fossil Fuel Savings: Possible, not evaluated.
Cost (savings?): Unknown.
Cost effectiveness: Unknown.

Use carbon­based metrics for measuring recycling

Summary: The State currently evaluates an annual waste recovery rate for the state as a whole, as well as individual
“wastesheds.” Wastesheds and the state as a whole have been held to recovery goals through 2009. The goals and
rates are a measure of the percentage of waste generated (discarded) that is recovered. (For example, Metro’s goal was
to recover 64% of its waste in 2009.)
The State should add a greenhouse gas element to the recovery goals and rates. (Recovery goals for years following
2009 will need to be set by the Legislature; see recommendations #11 and #12 for related details.) Viewing recycling as
a greenhouse gas reduction measure might lead communities to place higher emphasis on higher‐impact materials and
programs, and might also change how the public understands the benefit of recycling.
Lead: Oregon Legislature (new goals), DEQ (implementation)
Type of Action: Standards
Timing of Impact: Short‐Term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Likely yes, but not evaluated.
Fossil Fuel Savings? Likely yes; not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Some cost to DEQ (staff time) to program, maintain, and explain a GHG emissions calculator for recovery.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
52The lower estimate was developed for a similar alternative evaluated for the Governor’s Advisory Group on Global Warming in 2004.

For
the higher estimate, we assume that 25% of residential homes and commercial buildings pursue a high level of salvage in 2020 where
approximately 2/3 of all materials used over the life cycle are salvaged. Salvage increases end‐of‐life benefits by 20% and increases
construction and maintenance impacts by 25%. There were no estimates made on the feasibility of this scenario due to supply and demand
scenarios. This higher estimate may be regarded as an upper bound of the potential of building material reuse.

Comments: While waste recovery is a valuable approach for reducing GHG emissions, there are additional benefits to
recovery. There is some risk in associating recovery closely with climate change actions, and effectively de‐emphasizing
other benefits.
27.

Implement policies to reduce loss of recyclables at processing facilities

Summary: Many recyclables are collected commingled (mixed together) and must be sorted prior to being sent to end
markets for use in making new products. The processing facilities (also called “material recovery facilities” or “MRFs”)
use a combination of manual and mechanical methods to sort recyclables. Loss rates (percentage of incoming
recyclables that don’t get to the proper final market) range widely, from an estimated 0.16% for newsprint, to 20% or
higher for plastic containers. 53
In 2009, DEQ convened the Oregon Commingled Recycling Systems Improvement Project. The purpose of the project is
to identify opportunities to improve Oregon’s commingled recycling system at all levels, from collection and consumer
education to processing and end‐markets. This state‐wide project follows a Contamination in Commingled Recycling
Systems Standards & Guidelines Initiative that EPA Region 10 facilitated in 2008 among stakeholders in the Pacific
Northwest. Workgroup meetings are currently on hold while DEQ completes a 2009/2010 study of MRF loss rates.
Options for reducing processing losses include improving inputs (less contamination by waste generators) and changes
to how processing is conducted. Several other recommendations (e.g., #28, #29, and #30) address inputs to the MRFs.
This recommendation focuses on how processing is conducted. The processing industry competes for feedstock in part
on price; the only effective standard on quality is what end‐markets are willing to accept and how much they’re willing
to pay for it. Due in part to intense demand from China and tolerance there for higher contamination, domestic mills
are limited in their ability to pay much of a premium for higher quality materials. As a consequence, if processors incur
higher costs associated with better sorting, any costs not recouped through higher revenue from end‐markets must be
passed up the supply chain to the waste collectors.
This limits the ability of the MRFs to reduce mis‐sorting and
contamination. State law prohibits the intentional disposal of source‐separated recyclables, but DEQ has only used this
to enforce against a MRF operator on one occasion.
A policy or policies should be implemented to incent quality and reduce the mis‐sorting of materials by MRFs. Examples
of possible approaches include financial resources for MRFs, the development of MRF standards (which would be used
by local governments in directing the flow of collected recyclables), permitting MRFs, and/or more aggressive
enforcement by DEQ. These (and potentially other) options may be considered by the Oregon Commingled Recycling
Systems Improvement Project when it reconvenes this fall.
Lead: Oregon DEQ, possibly Oregon Legislature, local governments, processing facilities.
Type of Action: Regulation and/or Incentives.
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.02 – 0.03 million MTCO2e in 2020 if a 50% reduction in MRF losses can be
attained. 54 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.04 – 0.06 MMTCO2e in 2020.)
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes.
53 These estimates were provided by Metro and are based on a study at MRFs in the mid‐2000s.

A more recent study was conducted by

Metro and DEQ in 2009‐2010 but results are not yet available.
54DEQ reviewed materials collected in 2008 and reported under the statewide material recovery survey in the categories of “on‐route

(residential),” “multi‐family,” and “commercial” collections. Simplifying assumptions were made regarding the percentage of each material,
by collection mode, sent to MRFs. (All residential materials were assumed to be sorted at MRFs except for 50% of glass; most commercial
materials were assumed to be sorted at MRFs except for 50‐90% of corrugated and 50‐70% of glass). MRF loss rates from Metro’s study (of
residential loss rates) were applied to residential materials. For commercial materials, which in some cases are sorted separately and
believed to be subject to smaller processing losses, a range of MRF loss rates were used, with Metro’s rates as an upper bound, and 25% of
Metro’s loss rates as a lower bound (except for newsprint, which was kept constant at a low 0.16%).

Cost (Savings)? Higher costs to processors (better/different equipment, other operational changes) will be passed on to
recycling collectors, and then to ratepayers. Some costs will be offset by lower disposal costs. End‐users of the
recyclables (e.g., newsprint mills and their customers) will realize significant cost savings.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.

Comments: Cross‐contamination of recyclables sent to end‐markets has been a major concern to domestic
end‐users of recyclables, especially paper mills. Mills have been forced to spend millions of dollars adding
screening equipment and on downtime, premature equipment failure, and disposal costs caused by
contamination of recyclable feedstocks resulting from a variety of factors, including inadequate outreach to
households, collection system changes (such as commingling and roll carts), and inadequate processing by
MRFs. Improving processing at MRFs would have a co‐benefit of cleaning up the feedstocks sent to end‐users.
According to Chris Thomas of SP Recycling, “As an owner of a mill that receives a lot of the material from the
Northwest, even small improvements in material quality can have huge effects on the mills’ ability to be
competitive in the market and for survival. Any combination of . . . (improvements in processing) could have a
net effect of a few percentage points on MRF outbound quality. The overall positive effect to the mills would
be drastic.”
28.

Expand product stewardship focusing on end­of­life management to cover additional materials;
include life cycle GHG emissions as a primary product selection criteria

Summary: Product stewardship is an environmental management strategy in which all parties involved in the design,
production, sale and use of a product take responsibility for minimizing the product’s environmental impact throughout
all stages of the product’s life. The greatest responsibility lies with whoever has the most ability to affect the life cycle
environmental impacts of the product.
Recent examples of product stewardship in Oregon are the Oregon E‐Cycles program and the PaintCare program. In
both cases, industry has primary responsibility for financing and providing for the convenient collection of unwanted
product from consumers at end‐of‐life.
Oregon should continue to bring more products under the umbrella of product stewardship. While Oregon should work
on both “upstream” design changes and also reducing “upstream” emissions (under recommendation #5), Oregon
should also continue to use product stewardship as a means to improve recovery (recycling) of products. Oregon’s
product stewardship efforts currently focus on products that contain toxic chemicals and/or are difficult to manage at
end‐of‐life; the State should add greenhouse gas reduction potential to that list of criteria.
Lead: Oregon Legislature, Oregon DEQ, producing industries.
Type of Action: Regulation.
Timing of Impact: Effective in the short‐term (1‐5 years) but will require longer (10 years) to cover all products that have
been identified as having potential.
GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.07 – 0.11 million MTCO2e in 2020. 55, 56 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.07 – 0.12 MMTCO2e
in 2020.)

55 The most comprehensive review of potential products for inclusion in product stewardship efforts in North America is the Canada Wide

Action Plan for Extended Producer Responsibility, developed by the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment in 2009. This Plan
identifies products for inclusion in “phase one” and “phase two” of a nationally harmonized program. For the purposes of estimating
potential GHG reductions, DEQ reviewed the products in phases one and two, and assumed that Oregon legislation or rules would require
stewardship of the following products: mercury‐containing lamps (2011), carpet (2013), additional consumer electronics (2015), recyclable
film plastic (2016), some household hazardous wastes (2017), and appliances (2018). This list was developed for the purpose of estimating
potential GHG reductions only, and in no way implies selection or targeting of materials for potential product stewardship legislation in

Expand bottle bill to cover additional materials; increase deposit to ten cents if 80% redemption rate

Summary: The bottle bill should be expanded to include all beverages except milk. In addition, if an 80% redemption

achieve and maintain an 80% redemption rate.

Increase funding by $1.20 per household­year for recycling outreach

Summary: State law requires local governments to conduct outreach and education to residents and businesses
regarding recycling. Some communities invest heavily in outreach, while others do not. An increase in outreach efforts
would increase participation in recycling and other waste recovery efforts (such as composting). The State should
provide funding for effective recycling outreach.
Lead: DEQ could coordinate development of enhanced outreach materials. Oregon Legislature could create a funding
mechanism to help support local outreach efforts. Implementation would primarily be the responsibility of local
governments, which often delegate responsibility to their franchised waste collectors.
Type of Action: Education
Oregon. A 2018 cut‐off date is used because lead time is required before recovery programs are in place by 2020. Of these materials,
recovery of carpet, consumer electronics, recyclable film plastic, and appliances are assumed to result in meaningful GHG reductions. DEQ
bumped the recovery rates for these materials from the business‐as‐usual forecast by 20% for carpet, consumer electronics, and recyclable
film plastic, and increased the recovery tonnage for “other mixed metals” by an amount equal to 25% of the recovery tonnage for computers
and monitors. Recycling of carpet is one instance where DEQ did not use the emissions factors provided by EPA. EPA’s model suggests that
recycling one ton of carpet reduces GHG emissions by an amount 180% of the emissions associated with producing the carpet in the first
place. Rather, DEQ used the recycling factor for mixed plastics (where recycling reduces GHG emissions by 76% of the emissions associated
with producing the product in the first place), and used this as a high estimate of the GHG reduction potential of recycling carpet (relative to
production of carpet). Scaling it by 50% (to 38%) provides a lower estimate of per‐ton emissions reduction potential, given the mixed
materials and challenges associated with recycling carpet.
56 An additional GHG reduction credit of 0.003 – 0.015 MMTCO2e is added to reflect a reduction in MRF losses due to better management of
film plastics. This is based on an assumption that by 2020, stewardship of recyclable film plastics (added 2016) has reduced film plastics
mixed with other recyclables by 30‐50%, resulting in a reduction in overall MRF losses of 8‐25%. See recommendation #27 for additional
details on estimating GHG reduction potential associated with reducing MRF losses.
57 Based on projections by Peter Spendelow (DEQ) for the Oregon Bottle Bill Task Force (2009), updated in 2010. The projections assume
that in the absence of bottle bill changes, the recovery rates for targeted materials would fall in 2020 to 74% for aluminum, 69% for glass,
and 42% for plastic containers. With the addition of wine, liquor, juice, coffee, and sports drinks, and a ten‐cent deposit, the projected
recovery rates rise to 86% for aluminum, 88% for glass, and 70% for plastic.

Require garbage and recycling service parity (residential curbside)

Summary: Approximately 60% of Oregon households with curbside recycling have their recyclables collected weekly on
the same day as garbage. Approximately 40% have their garbage collected weekly, with recycling service offered on the
same day, but only every other week. 60 All other things being equal, this lower level of convenience for recycling
(relative to garbage) has been shown, on average, to depress recycling participation and reduce the recovery of
materials. Although it also saves on fuel and offers the potential for lower collection costs, life cycle analyses of the GHG
impacts of recycling and garbage service suggest that less frequent curbside service offers a greenhouse gas benefit
approximately 88% that of curbside recycling service on par with garbage collection.
DEQ should impose a temporary moratorium on any program approvals for less frequent service under the opportunity‐
to‐recycle law, so that cities would not be allowed to reduce service convenience for recycling. DEQ should then create
an easy‐to‐use tool that “monetizes” the GHG impacts and benefits of curbside recycling. This tool would be used to
evaluate curbside collection systems to provide for a more complete understanding of the costs (and benefits to
society). Where the cost of service plus monetized benefits of more frequent curbside (parity with garbage) are found
to be lower than the cost of service plus monetized benefits of less frequent service, DEQ should require the provision of
more frequent service.

GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.008 – 0.033 million MTCO2e in 2020.61 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.016 – 0.064
MMTCO2e in 2020.)
58A 2002 report by Skumatz Economic Research Associates, Inc. for the State of Iowa (Evaluating the Impacts of Recycling/Diversion
Education Programs – Effective Methods and Optimizing Expenditures) found a correlation between program expenditures on education
and waste recovery rates. Specifically, in communities with low educational expenditures (e.g. $0.30 per household per year), adding $1 per
household per year – controlling for basic demographic and recycling program differences – adds about 3% in recycling rates. In higher‐
spending communities ($1.40 per household per year), adding $1 more increases recycling rates by about 1%. To model potential impacts
in Oregon, we assume that 80% of Oregon’s population is located in “higher‐spending” communities and 20% is located in “lower‐spending”
communities, and that expenditures increase $1 per household (in 2001 dollars) statewide. We increase recovery by ([80% x 1% + 20% x
3%]), representing the absolute increase in the statewide recovery rate. The result is an increase in the state’s recovery rate of 0.56%. This
is allocated across potentially recoverable materials using the same method described in recommendation #11. The resulting point estimate
of GHG reductions is then converted into a range by taking 50% and 150% of the point estimate, representing the high uncertainty
associated with this approach.
59 Adjusting the $1 (in 2001) to 2009 dollars (using the CPI‐U; 2010 not available yet) results in $1.21 per household.

It accounted for fuel use by collection vehicles, MRF losses, the “upstream” impacts and benefits of recyclables actually recycled (post‐MRF
losses), transport of MRF residue, and marginal changes in garbage collection, transport to landfill, landfill energy recovery, and landfill
carbon storage. The range of results represents a lower and upper estimate of potential impacts. The lower estimate assumes that in the

Develop markets for compost products

Summary: Composting – especially composting of food waste – offers the potential for reductions in GHG emissions.
Compost also provides other environmental benefits. The viability of the compost industry is dependent upon strong
demand for finished compost product.
Oregon should increase demand for compost product. Opportunities include: exploring potential agricultural markets
(agriculture is a major user of compost in California, where it has been strongly promoted; Oregon lags far behind and
the reasons for this are not well understood); expanded use of compost by ODOT and in other state construction
projects; adoption of “low impact development” standards or requirements for new construction by cities and counties;
and requirements that landfill covers be managed for higher rates of oxidation (see recommendation #36).
Lead: ODOT, DAS, city and county governments
Type of Action: Standards
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1 – 5 years).
GHG Savings? Yes, but not evaluated.
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes; not evaluated.
Cost (Savings)? Not evaluated.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not evaluated.
Comments: Other environmental benefits of compost use include more water infiltration (resulting in less run‐off and
reduced demand for irrigation), improved soil tilth and fertility (resulting in higher yields), a potential for reductions in
fertilizer and herbicide applications, and potential for reduced pollutant run‐off.
33.

Require communities over a certain population to collect for recovery food waste from residences and
certain categories of non­residential waste generators

Summary: The State should require communities over a certain size to provide an opportunity to single‐family
households and certain classes of non‐residential waste generators to separate food waste from garbage for the
purposes of recovery. Targeted non‐residential generators might include, for example, food processors, restaurants,
grocery stores, hospitals and schools over a certain size. The requirement would need to include a standard that food
waste collection service be offered at rates such that there is no financial penalty to participate.
This is an extension of the current “opportunity‐to‐recycle” model required of cities with populations greater than 4,000.
Lead: Oregon Legislature, DEQ (policy, regulation); local governments, franchised haulers, and recovery industry
(implementation).
Type of Action: Regulation.
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1 – 5 years).
absence of this policy, by 2020 only 40% of households would have curbside/garbage parity, and that this policy would raise that to 60%.
The upper estimate assumes that in the absence of this policy, in 2020, no households would have curbside/garbage parity, and that this
policy would raise that to 80%.

Implement a feed­in tariff for anaerobic digestion

Summary: In‐vessel anaerobic digestion (AD) offers an alternative to composting as a method of recovering value from
food waste. AD rapidly decomposes food waste and produces three outputs of value: biogas that can be used to
generate electricity, heat, and an undegraded waste remnant that can be further stabilized via composting. Advocates
for AD have suggested that feed‐in tariffs would help to make AD economically viable in Oregon (and elsewhere). A
feed‐in tariff guarantees a producer of electricity from renewable sources (such as AD) access to the grid and a
guarantee of a long‐term price for power produced that covers the difference between the actual cost to produce the
electricity and what utilities are otherwise willing to pay for it. The State should provide a feed‐in tariff for anaerobic
digestion.
According to Dean Foor of Essential Consulting Oregon, 30,000 tons per year is probably a very low threshold for a single
AD facility in Oregon. 63 A larger facility will benefit from better economies of scale. Feedstocks may be 80% food waste
and 20% manure. At this rate, one small AD facility would need approximately 24,000 TPY of food waste. Limiting our
analysis to MSW (and excluding agricultural wastes), commercial and residential food waste collection programs just in
Willamette Valley cities might be able to produce 43,000 – 104,000 TPY of food waste (not including food‐soiled paper)
in 2020. To avoid high transportation costs, the AD facility typically needs to be located no more than ~60 miles of the
source of food, although economics improve significantly if transport distances are shorter. This suggests the potential
for 1‐3 AD facilities serving the entire Willamette Valley, with a combined generating capacity of roughly 1.5 – 3.5 MW.
Oregon already has a pilot scale feed‐in tariff, limited to solar photovoltaic systems with capacities of 500 kW or less.

62 Based on estimates by the City of Portland, extrapolated statewide using “low” and “high” estimates.

The Portland research assumes
recovery is 75% food waste and 25% soiled paper. The “low” estimate for residential collection assumes 40% participation and 60%
capture rates, for all cities with populations greater than 40,000. The “high” estimate assumes 60% participation and 80% capture rates, for
all cities with populations greater than 20,000. The “low estimate” for nonresidential assumes 40% participation and 60% capture rates, for
all cities with populations greater than 40,000. The “high” estimate assumes 60% participation and 80% capture rates, for all cities with
populations greater than 20,000. The non‐residential estimates also assume that 80% of the food and soiled paper currently disposed of
from nonresidential sources are from sources that would be eligible to participate in this type of collection service. DEQ assumes recovery is
75% compost and 25% anaerobic digestion. For the sake of modeling, DEQ assumes no significant shift of feedstock currently being
recovered from composting facilities to AD facilities. The “low” and “high” estimates also use different emissions factors for landfilling of
food waste, as follows: a lower factor for methane emissions using the methane generation algorithm from EPA’s WARM model, discounted
to account for emissions resulting in years after 2020, and a higher factor for methane emissions in 2020 based on the methodology

GHG Savings? Yes, assuming that the feedstocks aren’t diverted from composting facilities (see comments below).
Approximately 0.013 – 0.045 million MTCO2e in 2020. 64 (Sensitivity analysis: 0.025 – 0.061 MMTCO2e in 2020.)
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes.
Cost (Savings)? Electric ratepayers pay for the feed‐in tariff. Haulers/waste generators also pay a tip fee at the AD
facility to deposit food waste (and other feedstocks), although this fee may be comparable to (or lower than) traditional
disposal fees.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not quantified, although a cursory review of literature suggests that feed‐in tariffs are often viewed
as a cost‐effective method of increasing renewable power generation.
Comments: The Materials Management Committee originally evaluated this policy option on the assumption that
anaerobic digestion of food wastes would have a greater net GHG reduction than composting of food wastes. A
subsequent review of a comparison produced by ICF Consulting for Environment Canada suggests that this might not be
the case. 65 However, the comparison is complicated by larger uncertainties in the life cycle GHG impacts, particularly
involving soil carbon storage of finished compost.
This alternative focuses on anaerobic digestion because of literature demonstrating that it offers a potential to reduce
GHG emissions relative to the alternative (disposal). As research into alternative recovery approaches is completed (see
recommendation #9), the State should consider offering a feed‐in tariff to additional technologies that demonstrate a
meaningful greenhouse gas reduction potential.
Some literature suggests a net job creation potential from feed‐in tariffs, generally.
An alternative to dedicated AD facilities is co‐digestion of food and other putrescible wastes at wastewater treatment
plants. This is viewed as highly feasible at those plants that have excess capacity. This practice has been widely adopted
throughout Europe with a high degree of success. Some such development is already underway, including a retrofit of
the Pendleton treatment plant to accept food waste from area Wal‐Mart stores and the Eastern Oregon Correctional
Institution for gas production.
35.

Conduct improved research into methane emissions, as well as opportunities to reduce emissions
through better surface monitoring

Summary: The State should conduct or support research into two related topics. The first would continue to improve
our collective understanding of methane emissions from landfills and the key variables that impact emissions (including
the impacts of different waste types, the timing of emissions generation, and the effectiveness of gas collection and
oxidation at the landfill surface). This would improve the accuracy of emissions estimates, and improve understanding
of how emissions can best be further reduced. This could involve both primary (field) and secondary (literature)
research.
The second research project would involve field research (surface monitoring) at Oregon landfills to better understand
the prevalence and potential impact of emissions “hot spots.” There is concern that potentially large quantities of
methane may escape collection where landfill covers develop cracks or tears. While EPA air quality regulations require

“high” estimates and assuming that 80% of the food and soiled paper currently disposed of from nonresidential sources are from sources
that would be eligible to participate in this type of collection service. The Portland research assumes recovery is 75% food waste and 25%
soiled paper. The “low” estimate assumes 40% participation and 60% capture rates, for both households and eligible businesses in all
Willamette Valley cities with populations greater than 40,000. The “high” estimate assumes 60% participation and 80% capture rates, for
both households and eligible businesses in all Willamette Valley cities with populations greater than 20,000. The “low” and “high” estimates
also use different emissions factors for landfilling of food waste, as described in recommendation #33. DEQ assumes that all recovery goes
to anaerobic digestion facilities.

periodic surface monitoring at larger landfills, these requirements may not be sufficient to identify hot spots in a timely

Require intermediate covers to be designed as oxidation covers at areas of landfills without active gas
collection

Summary: Some landfill cells are partially filled, covered with an “intermediate cover,” and then left alone for years
while other areas of the landfill are developed. Later, waste may again be placed above this intermediate cover. Only
later is a final cover installed. Intermediate covers are expected to be less effective at reducing methane emissions than
final covers. In addition, areas under intermediate covers may or may not have gas collection systems installed, and in
some cases, it may be years or even decades before this area of the landfill is closed and/or brought under gas
collection. DEQ should require such intermediate covers to be designed and maintained to enhance oxidation (microbial
conversion of methane to carbon dioxide as gas passes through the cover). This may involve adding more soil and/or
blending the cover soil with substances such as compost or sludge, so as to enhance microbial activity.
Lead: DEQ
Type of Action: Regulatory/Permitting. DEQ already has regulatory authority to require this at DEQ’s discretion.
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.03 million MTCO2e in 2020. 66
Fossil Fuel Savings? No, unless the requirement is so expensive that it leads landfills to install active gas collection in
order to avoid it, and the collected gas is used for energy.

66 DEQ has recently updated its model of GHG generation, collection rates, oxidation rates, and emissions for 10 large, open MSW landfills,

and an 11th category of “other open MSW landfills” for emissions through 2008. An earlier model (2004) forecast emissions from these
landfills to 2025 (including 2020). Using the updated model and emissions in 2008, DEQ identified three landfills that might be impacted by
this requirement: Finley Buttes, Wasco, and “other.” The other larger, individually‐modeled landfills are expected to be exempt due to the
presence of active gas collection in all areas under intermediate cover. The gas emissions model for 2008 was adjusted by increasing the
oxidation rate from 10% to 30% at these three landfills, adjusted downward to assume that only 20% and 76% of the total surface area
would be effected at Finley Buttes and Wasco landfills, respectively (along with the simplifying assumption that emissions are uniformly
distributed across the surface area). For the category of “other” landfills, which includes both opened and closed landfills, we assume that
10% of the surface area covering wastes placed prior to 2003, and 50% of the surface area covering wastes placed in 2003 and subsequent
years, would be in intermediate cover. Combined, these assumptions result in an estimated reduction of emissions of 0.02 MTCO2e. Results
are scaled up to 0.03 MTCO2e for 2020 based on the ratio of projected total MSW landfill emissions in 2020 to estimated total MSW landfill
emissions in 2008.

Cost (Savings)? DEQ might need to write an internal management directive. Some landfills will not be impacted by this;
others may have to bring in additional soils.
Cost/Effectiveness? TBD.
Comments: Designing intermediate covers as oxidation layers could increase demand for compost product, and so could
be viewed as a market development activity for compost.
37.

Require installation of gas collection at landfills (horizontal collectors) as waste is placed (reduced
installation delay), consistent with current technologies

Summary: Landfill methane production can begin very rapidly after waste placement, then continue for decades,
depending on landfill conditions. Large landfills with gas collection systems are not typically required to install gas
collection until several (five or longer) years after waste is initially placed. However, some landfills choose to install
horizontal collectors throughout the waste mass as it is placed. This increases gas capture and reduces emissions
by creating a mechanism to collect early gas generation.
DEQ should require the installation of gas collection systems within 12‐18 months of waste placement for landfills
that already have an active gas collection system. Landfills without an active gas collection system would not be
affected.
Lead: DEQ.
Type of Action: Regulatory/Permitting. DEQ has authority to require this at landfills that recirculate leachate. Additional
research is needed to determine if DEQ has authority at other landfills.
Timing of Impact: Short‐term (1‐5 years).
GHG Savings? Yes. Approximately 0.002 – 0.05 million MTCO2e in 2020. 67
Fossil Fuel Savings? Yes, as most landfills with active gas collection use the gas for energy recovery.
Cost (Savings)? Additional cost required to install early/horizontal collectors. Additional revenue from increase in
energy recovery. Costs not quantified.
Cost/Effectiveness? Not estimated.
38.

Require that alternative final covers be designed to reduce GHG emissions

Summary: This builds on what was a “tier one” recommendation of the Governor’s Advisory Group on Global
Warming (2004), with significant GHG reduction potential. The Advisory Group recommended that DEQ revise its
solid waste guidance for landfills subject to EPA New Source Performance Standards for landfill gas so that
alternative final covers at landfills would also need to reduce GHG emissions comparable to a conventional geo‐
67 Gas modeling used in 2004 suggests that at wet landfills, 29.7% of gas generation occurs within the first five years of waste placement, and

at dry landfills, 1.1% of gas generation occurs within the first five years of waste placement. However, first‐order decay models suggest that
90.3% of gas generation occurs within the first five years at wet landfills, and 75.1% occurs within the first five years at dry landfills. To
estimate the potential GHG reductions from this recommendation, we use the first set of values (29.7% and 1.1%) as a lower bound, and the
mid‐points of the two values (60.0% wet and 38.1% dry) as a fairly arbitrary and hypothetical upper bound. These values are applied to the
2008 gas generation/emissions projection referenced in recommendation #36, for the only landfill that this recommendation (#37) is
expected to impact: Finley Buttes (a dry landfill). Methane generation in 2008 at Finley Buttes is multiplied by 1.1% and 38.1% as a crude
estimate of emissions that occur before gas collection is installed (using a simplifying assumption that disposal in year X is the same in years
X‐1 through X‐4). These “early” emissions are then multiplied by an assumed gas capture rate of 75% as a rough estimate of emissions
reduction resulting from this measure. Results are then scaled upward to account for presumed higher gas generation in 2020, using the
same scaling factor applied in recommendation #36. The wide range of results suggests that this recommendation would benefit from
further evaluation.

membrane cover. Such a change, which DEQ did not implement, would have impacted four large landfills in
Central and Eastern Oregon. Since 2004, three of these four landfills have significantly expanded gas collection,
significantly reducing the potential benefit of this approach.
DEQ should apply a variation on this requirement to all but the smallest of landfills using alternative final covers.
Rather than requiring alternative covers to be “comparable” to a geomembrane, DEQ should require that
alternative covers be designed to reduce GHG emissions using best management practices available. This
requirement could be met through a variety of practices, including active gas collection and/or improved soil
oxidation. The result would be to reduce emissions from several mid‐sized landfills in Central and Eastern Oregon.

APPENDIX D
Background: Overview of Methodology for Evaluating Emissions Reduction Potential
Where possible, DEQ attempted to estimate the emissions reduction potential of individual
alternatives/recommendations. These estimates should be understood to be relatively crude in most cases.
A variety of methods were used to evaluate emissions reduction potential. These methods are briefly summarized
as follows:
For several alternatives/recommendations with broad, multi‐material impacts (1, 4, 14), DEQ drew on estimates of
the life cycle GHG emissions of all materials either used in the US or consumed in Oregon, derived from research
conducted by the US EPA, research currently underway as part of the development of Oregon’s consumption‐based
GHG emissions inventory, and an input‐output GHG estimation tool developed by Carnegie Mellon University (and
applied to state purchasing by Good Company).
The baseline model for alternatives/recommendations focusing on food was constructed using USDA data on the
types and quantities of food produced and consumed in the US, pro‐rated to Oregon. USDA data was also available
for the retail and consumer loss rates for each commodity. Using historic caloric rates of increase, an average diet
was projected for the year 2020. Greenhouse gas emission factors, courtesy of CleanMetrics, were then identified
for 30 different categories of commodities. Average transport was assumed to be 2414km from farm gate to retail.
Both refrigeration and freezers during transport were considered. Food packaging, refrigeration at retail, and
consumer transport, storage, and cooking was not considered. Finally, emissions from the waste disposed was
modeled using Oregon DEQ projected data on the quantity of waste produced in future years and the emissions
associated with that waste in 2020.
For alternatives/recommendations involving building materials and practices, a baseline model of building‐related
GHG emissions was established for all commercial and residential buildings through 2020. The life cycle emissions
included: original and replacement material production, construction and maintenance, use, and end‐of‐life. The
model was based on the ODOE GHG inventory for Oregon, which has published data from 1990 through 2005. The
average increase in use phase emission over the 15 years of data available was used to estimate the future
emissions for commercial and residential buildings. Using an Oregon DEQ‐commissioned study on the life cycle
GHG emission of an average residential home in Oregon, estimates for materials production, construction,
maintenance, and end‐of‐life were made for both residential and commercial buildings on the state scale. All GHG
reduction scenarios were evaluated against this baseline model.
For all other alternatives/recommendations evaluated, a “business as usual” (BAU) projection was made of
materials generated as waste, and subsequently recovered (by recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion) or
disposed of (via incineration or landfilling) in 2020, assuming that per‐capita waste generation remains constant
(from 2008) and that the composition and disposition of materials is similarly unchanged. Emissions factors for a
variety of materials were then applied to different actions (materials production, represented by waste generation;
forest carbon sequestration associated with source reduction; recycling; composting; landfilling; etc.). These
emissions factors were largely – but not exclusively – drawn from the documentation behind EPA’s WARM tool.
The emissions for the BAU scenario were then compared against emissions for a variety of other scenarios
involving changes in the quantities of wastes generated, recovered, and/or disposed of. Landfill emissions were
derived in part from a DEQ model of Oregon landfills and assumed methane gas capture rates for the state’s largest
landfills. This landfill submodule was also used to evaluate two alternatives/recommendations specific to landfill
practices (37 and 38).

In all cases, the emissions factors used in these models are somewhat imprecise. Compounding this is a dearth of
information on the potential impacts of different policies and programs (for example, “how much would an
undefined incentive for carbon labeling result in changes by producers and consumers, and in what ways?”). While
DEQ has attempted in some cases to reflect this uncertainty through the use of ranges of estimates as opposed to
point estimates, readers are cautioned to understand the moderate to high uncertainty associated with many of
these estimates.
Timing of Emissions Reductions

DEQ was charged with estimating the emissions reductions potential in the year 2020. The use of this accounting
frame requires that two additional considerations be explained.
First, emissions associated with materials management only change when producers and consumers change how
materials are managed. Many of the recommendations are designed to drive such change, through education,
incentives, and/or regulation. There is a delay between when programs are implemented and when producers and
consumers respond with changes in how they use materials. The extent to which change occurs depends
somewhat on the timing of when such education, incentives, and/or regulations begin. DEQ has generally assumed,
for the purposes of modeling, that implementation of most recommendations would begin around 2015, which
allows some time for resulting change to occur. This assumption is made for the purpose of standardizing
evaluation, and does not necessarily reflect political or economic conditions that may result in some
recommendations being delayed. In any case, many of the policies and programs evaluated here have the
potential for a delay in when they result in actual changes in materials management.
While this first consideration is true for all of the committees of the 2020 Vision project (energy/utilities, industry,
forestry, transportation/land use, agriculture, materials management), materials management has a second
consideration related to timing. Even if consumers or producers change how they manage materials in 2020, not
all of the resulting changes in emissions occur in that year. (This is unlike, say, consuming less electricity in 2020,
where emissions reductions are instantaneous). Specific to materials management, some emissions or emissions
reductions can be delayed by years or even decades. These include: methane generation at landfills (or reduced
generation, in the case of waste diversion); increased carbon uptake and storage in forests associated with the
source reduction and recycling of wood and paper; and increased carbon storage in soils treated with compost.
To accommodate the need to evaluate all emissions reductions relative to actual emissions in the year 2020, DEQ
adjusted the landfill methane and forest/soil carbon storage emissions factors provided by EPA to reflect the fact
that only some of the emissions associated with how materials are managed in the period 2015‐2020 will occur in
2020. 68 So as to not unfairly bias alternatives in favor of landfilling, DEQ made an equivalent adjustment to the
landfill carbon storage emissions factors. Regardless, the result is to generally downplay or underestimate the
potential carbon benefit, relative to other practices, of practices that recycle, reuse, or reduce use of wood and
paper, produce compost, and divert putrescible wastes from landfills. To illustrate the potential impact of these
adjustments, DEQ also conducted a sensitivity analysis for some alternatives/recommendations wherein all
consequential GHG reductions associated with a materials management practice in 2020 are assigned to the year
2020 (even though some of the reductions are delayed). This provides an alternative picture of the GHG reduction
potential of these actions. Results of the sensitivity analysis are presented alongside other results in Appendix C.
