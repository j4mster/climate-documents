Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

Executive Summary
A Clean Energy Revolution

Energy Independence: Massachusetts is
at the end of the energy pipeline, figuratively
and literally. All of our fossil-based energy
sources — oil, natural gas, and coal — are
derived from other regions of the country
(e.g., the Gulf Coast or Western states) and
other parts of the world, many of them
unstable or hostile to the United States,
(e.g., countries in the Middle East and
Venezuela). Thus, all spending on fossil fuel
energy — whether to fuel power plants,
buildings, or vehicles — flows out of state
and fails to provide income to in-state
businesses or employees. This exported
economic value is significant, totaling almost
$22 billion in 2008.1 In 2008, an average
Massachusetts household spent about
$5,200 for energy costs, of which about
$1,700 was for heating (space and water),
$1,300 for electricity, and $2,200 for
gasoline. Almost all of these expenditures
leave Massachusetts.

Between 2007 and the end of 2010, solar
photovoltaic (PV) systems installed and
scheduled for installation in Massachusetts
increased 20-fold – with jobs in solar
manufacturing, installation, and services
nearly tripling — while installed wind energy
increased 10-fold. In that same time period,
Massachusetts launched the most aggressive
energy efficiency program in the country,
with estimated savings of over $6 billion for
residential, municipal, industrial and
commercial customers and 4,500 jobs
sustained or created.
This is not a vision of a possible future for
Massachusetts. This is Massachusetts today.
It is in this context that the Executive Office
of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA)
presents the Massachusetts Clean Energy
and Climate Plan for 2020. The Global
Warming Solutions Act (GWSA, or the Act) of
2008 requires the Secretary of Energy and
Environmental Affairs to establish a
statewide limit on greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions of between 10 percent and 25
percent below 1990 levels for 2020 — on the
way toward an 80 percent reduction in
emissions by 2050 — along with a plan to
achieve the 2020 target. Secretary Bowles
has set that 2020 limit at 25 percent — and
this Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
contains the measures necessary to meet the
limit.

Energy Costs and Volatility: In addition
to the economic drain represented by
Massachusetts dollars flowing out of the
state for energy resources, energy
consumers have experienced wild price
swings and long term energy price increases.
The figures below show both steadily
increasing and volatile prices for natural gas,
electricity and gasoline.

Fulfilling that mandate will do much more
than meet the requirements of the Act. It will
allow the Commonwealth to address a
number of challenges, only one of which is
climate change. Most importantly, it will give
powerful impetus to the clean energy
revolution that has already begun.

Executive Summary

Economic Opportunity: Along with the
rest of the nation, Massachusetts is coming
out of the most severe recession in half a
century. In the transition to a clean energy
economy, Massachusetts has many
resources to bring to bear — and should be
the disproportionate beneficiary as the
economy becomes cleaner and greener.
Clean Edge, Inc., has found that
Massachusetts is the leading state on the
East Coast for clean energy innovation,
investment, deployment, and jobs.2

prices (source: DOER)

Massachusetts already has a core of
companies and jobs in clean energy, and this
industry has been growing even during
challenging economic times. According to a
Massachusetts Clean Energy Center
(MassCEC) survey of 471 local companies,
more than 11,000 people are employed in
clean energy at the end of 2010, up 65
percent since 2007. Some 3,500 people are
employed in manufacturing of energy
efficiency products, with growth of 20
percent since 2007, and the fastest growth
(67 percent) in energy storage, represented
by such companies as A123 Systems, Inc.,
Beacon Power Corp., and Premium Power
Corp.

prices (source: DOER)

Policies in this Plan will result in large
reductions in fossil fuel use in buildings,
electricity generation, and transportation.
These include energy efficiency programs,
advanced building codes, requirements for
increased renewable electricity generation,
federal vehicle efficiency standards, state
incentives for purchasing more efficient
vehicles, incentives to reduce vehicle miles
traveled, and ―smart growth‖ policies.
Through both direct and indirect impacts,
these policies will create an estimated
42,000 to 48,000 jobs in Massachusetts in

The figure for renewables is given as a range, because most of the value added for renewables is in manufacturing, and
the degree to which renewable components will be manufactured in the Commonwealth is fluid at this time, as is the
degree to which the state’s 2020 renewable energy requirements will be met from in-state sources.

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

Climate Change: The international
consensus on climate released in 2007 by
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) found that the ―warming of
the climate system is unequivocal, as is now
evident from observations of increases in
global average air and ocean temperatures,
widespread melting of snow and ice, and
rising global average sea level.‖4

to each of these pollutants has been linked
to adverse health effects. Ozone can also
irritate the respiratory system, causing
coughing, throat irritation, chest pain and
reduced lung function. Ozone can also
aggravate asthma, leading to more asthma
attacks and increased hospital admissions
and emergency room visits for respiratory
problems. Fine PM is associated with
aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular
disease resulting in increased hospital
admissions, emergency room visits and
premature mortality.

Massachusetts is vulnerable to severe
impacts from climate change. Impacts are
expected to include increased coastal
flooding from intense storms and permanent
inundation of low-lying coastal areas;
infrastructure and development located along
the coast affected by storm surges, sea level
rise, and saltwater intrusion; degraded water
quality and quantity, habitat loss, and
increased sedimentation and pollution of
waterways due to changes in precipitation;
increased number of extreme heat days,
impacting those with respiratory and
cardiovascular conditions; habitat for
commercially important fish and shellfish
species, such as cod and lobster, shifted
northward; and for recreation areas,
decreased average ski and snowboard
seasons and increased need for artificial
snow making.

These pollutants also damage ecosystems.
Acid rain is created when SO2 and NOx
emissions mix with water in the atmosphere.
Acid rain lowers the pH levels of lakes,
rivers, and soils, harming fish and
invertebrates. Exposure to ozone is
associated with a range of adverse impacts
to vegetation, including impairment of tree
growth and loss of agricultural crop yield.
Ozone can increase the rate of water loss by
trees causing forests to drain streams and
soils of water, thus stressing natural
ecosystems beyond the trees themselves.
Meeting Challenges, Seizing
Opportunities: At roughly 2 percent of the
U.S. economy and 1.3 percent of the nation’s
GHG emissions, Massachusetts could not, on
its own, stop global climate change even if it
reduced statewide emissions to zero
instantly. However, Massachusetts is in a
position to show the way to a clean energy
economy — and reap direct benefits in
economic growth — through the
development of smart, targeted policies that
reduce emissions by promoting greater
energy efficiency, developing renewable
energy, and encouraging other alternatives
to the combustion of fossil fuels. In the
process, Massachusetts will also start to get
off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, become more
energy independent, and jump start its
economy with new technologies, new
companies, and new jobs.

Local and Regional Air Pollution: In
addition to causing climate change,
emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels
result in a range of negative human health
and ecosystem impacts. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has
established health-based National Ambient
Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for six
pervasive pollutants that have welldocumented health and environmental
impacts: ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM),
lead, and carbon monoxide (CO). Exposure

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

The Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate
Plan for 2020 will put Massachusetts on a
path to meeting its statutory obligation to
reduce GHG emissions, and on the road to a
vibrant clean energy economy.

Projected Emission Reduction Range

% Reduction Below 1990 Statewide Emissions
by 2020

Setting the 2020 Emissions
Limit
The statewide GHG emissions limit set for
2020 was based on two years of analysis and
public comment, and followed a process to
determine the baseline Massachusetts 1990
emissions level and the predicted ―Business
as Usual‖ (BAU) emissions trajectory for
2020. The trend line of GHG emissions was
found to be relatively stable since 1990 and
projected as remaining relatively stable
through 2020. Policies and programs
implemented or initiated since the beginning
of the Patrick-Murray Administration in 2007
— including the Green Communities Act and
various state government executive actions,
and federal government actions — are
projected to result in GHG emissions
reduction of roughly 18 percent — roughly
the midpoint of the 10 percent to 25 percent
range required by the GWSA.

Figure ES-4. Projected emission reduction range
below 1990 by 2020. The range results from
uncertainties in Business as Usual (BAU)
emissions, policy designs, and impacts of
individual policies.

Table ES-2 (on page ES-6) displays the
portfolio of policies incorporated in this Clean
Energy and Climate Plan for 2020, and the
associated potential contribution to GHG
reduction below 1990 levels by 2020 for
each policy. In aggregate, these policies,
which include measures put in place since
2007 and new initiatives proposed in this
Plan, are projected to achieve emissions
reductions in the range of 18 percent to 33
percent by 2020 (see Figure ES-4). The
lower end of this range represents a scenario
in which Business as Usual (BAU) emissions
are higher than projected and actual
emissions reduction from the policies as
implemented is at the low end of estimates.
The higher end of the range represents a
scenario in which BAU emissions are lower
than projected and implementation success
is relatively high. A mid-range estimate for
the portfolio of policies results in GHG
emissions approximately 27 percent below
1990 levels by 2020 (See Figure ES-5 on
page ES-7).

Further analysis showed that it would be
technically feasible to reduce emissions by
up to 35 percent below 1990 levels by 2020
with additional policies that are costeffective. In a series of eight public hearings
held in June 2010, as required by the Act,
nearly 200 individuals and organizations
provided oral or written comment on the
2020 emissions reduction requirement and
on policy measures to meet the requirement.
The vast majority of commenters called for
the Secretary to set the GHG limit at 25
percent below 1990 levels, the maximum
allowed under the statute. The Secretary of
EEA then directed state technical teams to
conduct in-depth analyses of measures that
satisfy criteria of cost-effectiveness and
reducing GHG emissions.

Figure ES–5. Emissions reductions by sector for the portfolio of policies, at the mid-range estimate
of 27 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.

Based on these analyses, input from the Climate Protection and Green Economy Advisory
Committee created by the GWSA, and full consideration of the public comments received, EEA
determined that a responsible and achievable GHG emissions reduction limit for 2020 that
maximizes opportunities to realize energy cost savings, increase energy independence, and
promote growth in clean energy jobs in Massachusetts is 25 percent. The limit is at the high end
of the range for 2020 authorized by GWSA, but the middle of the range of possible outcomes for
the policies incorporated in this Plan.

An Integrated Portfolio of Policies
The GWSA provides broad authority to
choose policy tools — from targeted and
technology-specific policies to economy-wide
and market-based mechanisms — to
advance a clean energy economy while
reducing GHG emissions. An integrated
portfolio approach plays to Massachusetts
strengths and, taken as a whole, has the
greatest likelihood of reaching the goals of
addressing energy costs, energy security and
independence, and reducing GHG emissions.

In the last four years, Massachusetts has
demonstrated the effectiveness of a portfolio
approach. A combination of legislation,
executive action and private sector
entrepreneurship has aligned incentives and
created opportunities for clean energy
growth and GHG reductions.
The directive from the Secretary was to build
on this portfolio — expanding existing
programs where practical and developing
ES-7

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

new complementary policies that could
accelerate clean energy growth and lower
GHG emissions. Each of the policies
presented in this Plan — GHG reductions;
cost-effectiveness; lowering energy costs for
consumers and businesses; job growth;
equity; implementability; and co-benefits —
underwent rigorous analysis focusing on
criteria established by the Act and input from
the public hearings and Advisory Committee.
Some policies can be put in place immediately; others will be tested first through pilot
programs. Not every one of these policies
must be implemented to its fullest extent in
order to achieve the 2020 mandate. But
these represent the suite of policies that the
Patrick-Murray Administra-tion is committed
to pursuing over the next four years as we
build on the foundation created in the past
four years and work toward the 2020
emissions limit set by the Secretary.

All Cost-Effective Energy Efficiency
Existing Policy
With the Governor’s signing of the GCA of
2008, Massachusetts embarked on a path
to greatly increase investments in—and
return on investments from—building
energy improvements. From 2010 to
2012—the first three year plan approved
by the Department of Public Utilities
(DPU) under the GCA mandate to capture
all cost-effective energy efficiency
opportunities — the state will invest over
$2 billion, with an anticipated return of
over $6 billion in savings for customers,
and creation of thousands of clean
energy jobs that cannot be outsourced
overseas.
Advanced Building Energy Codes
Expanded Policy
Massachusetts has adopted a pathway to
greater energy efficiency in building
codes through a commitment in the GCA
to adopt the latest IECC, as well as by
creating a local-option ―stretch‖ code that
has been adopted by over 60
municipalities. This policy would complete
the transition to performance-based
codes by 2020 that go beyond the IECC
code in terms of efficiency while reducing
their complexity, giving developers flexibility and clear performance targets and
creating ―green‖ jobs.

This portfolio is divided into five categories:
buildings, electricity supply, transportation,
non-energy emissions, and cross-cutting
policies.

BUILDINGS
9.8 PERCENT REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS
Buildings consume over 50 percent of the
energy used in Massachusetts and are
therefore responsible for the greatest GHG
emissions of any sector. Energy use in
buildings comes from these two primary
areas: 1) fuels for heating — primarily
natural gas and heating oil, and 2) electricity
for air conditioning, lighting, ventilation,
appliances and equipment. The Clean Energy
and Climate Plan for 2020 takes into account
Massachusetts nation-leading energy
efficiency efforts mandated by the Green
Communities Act (GCA) of 2008, which will
produce substantial GHG reductions for
2020, and proposes additional measures that
will contribute toward meeting the 2020
limit. This category is expected to yield GHG
reductions of 9.8 percent.

Building Energy Rating and Labeling
New Policy
The real estate market currently operates
without explicit consideration of energy
efficiency. This policy would address this
market failure by introducing an energy
rating program designed to facilitate
―apples-to-apples‖ comparisons between
buildings. Initially in a pilot form, this
would be the buildings equivalent of the
EPA miles-per-gallon (MPG) rating on
cars and light trucks.

ES-8

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

―Deep‖ Energy Efficiency Improvements for Buildings New Policy
To reach our 2050 GHG reduction requirement, energy use in existing buildings must fall dramatically. To accomplish
this, it is necessary to begin retrofitting
buildings with much higher levels of insulation, less air leakage, and better windows than are typically installed in the
retrofit energy efficiency programs. This
policy, begun with pilots with utilities,
would make rebates and appropriate
training and technical support widely
available for ―deeper‖ energy improvements for residential buildings.

existing housing, and retain trees within
new housing developments. This pilot
program might be feasible within current
utility efficiency programs, or might require new funding and/or regulatory
authority.
Federal Appliance and Product
Standards
Existing Policy
The federal government sets energy efficiency standards for appliances, electronics, and other products. Under
President Obama, the DOE has planned
an accelerated schedule for setting new
standards between 2009 and 2013.
Nationwide these are expected to yield
major savings in electricity (11.5 percent
of total consumption in 2020), fuel, costs
to homeowners and businesses, and
carbon dioxide emissions, with Massachusetts getting its proportional share.

Expanding Efficiency Programs to
Commercial/Industrial Heating Oil
New Policy
Currently, electric utility programs provide funding for heating-related efficiency
measures in homes that use oil heat but
not for commercial and industrial buildings that use fuel oil for heating. Expanding the programs to such customers
would yield significant cuts in energy use
and GHG emissions.

ELECTRICITY SUPPLY
7.7 PERCENT REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS
The vast majority of existing power plants
burn fossil fuels to generate electricity, producing millions of tons of pollution. Nonfossil fuel electricity generation technologies
include nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, and
eligible biomass and anaerobic digestion,
which vary in their emissions profiles. The
character of the electric power sector as a
whole is determined by three key factors:
the demand for electricity overall, existing
generation capacity by technology type, and
how much of each type of existing capacity is
utilized to meet demand. The Clean Energy
and Climate Plan for 2020 relies on progress
in each of these areas made since 2007,
along with proposed new measures to move
toward a cleaner electricity supply.

Developing a Market for Solar
Thermal Water and Space Heating
New Policy
A policy framework will be established to
develop a mature and self-sustaining
market for solar thermal water and space
heating in both residential and commercial buildings as part of a broader effort
to support renewable heating technologies (such as clean biomass heating and
efficient heat pumps) for low-grade
heating needs and spur job and business
growth in renewable thermal.
Tree Retention and Planting to
Reduce Heating and Cooling Loads
New Policy
Trees help to reduce heating and cooling
loads in buildings. This policy would provide incentives to plant new trees around

Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio
Standard (RPS)
Existing Policy
The RPS was created as part of electricity
restructuring in Massachusetts in 1997
and then expanded in the GCA. The RPS
requires retail electricity suppliers—both
distribution companies and other retail
suppliers—to buy a growing percentage of
their electricity sales from eligible
resources. The RPS will require 15 percent
of electricity supply to be from renewable
sources by 2020.

of the Salem Harbor Station has indicated
that it expects the plant to close within
five years.
Clean Energy Imports Expanded Policy
Canada has substantial hydro-electric
resources, which have very low emissions,
and are available at relatively low cost
and with no need for renewable energy
subsidies (see RPS above). A new transmission line being developed by two
Massachusetts utilities, NSTAR and Northeast Utilities Service Co., in partnership
with Hydro Quebec (HQ) and with the
support of the Patrick-Murray Administration would tap more of these resources.
When this power line is completed, at
HQ’s expense, it will bring to New England
enough clean power to serve up to 15
percent of Massachusetts present electricity demand. Additional transmission lines
may also be possible.

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
(RGGI)
Existing Policy
Massachusetts is one of the 10 Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic states participating in a
regional effort to limit carbon dioxide
emissions from electric generating units.
The program, which began in January of
2009, establishes a region-wide cap on
CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired power
plants that will remain at the initial level
for six years then decrease 2.5 percent
per year for the next four years, for a
total reduction of 10 percent by 2018. Allowances are made available for purchase
in quarterly auctions. Massachusetts is investing over 80 percent of its auction
proceeds in energy efficiency, with smaller
amounts for renewable energy and other
consumer benefit programs.

Clean Energy Performance Standard
(CPS)
New Policy
A market-based framework is needed to
provide a clear signal to the electricity
market to improve upon the cleaner
energy portfolios of the last few years.
One approach to be considered is a CPS,
which would require electricity suppliers to
favor lower- and no-emissions sources in
the mix of electricity delivered to their
customers.

More Stringent EPA Power Plant Rules
New Policy
The EPA is in the midst of proposing and
implementing a variety of regulations that
will affect allowable water and air emissions of the nation’s power plant fleet.
The owners of some older, smaller power
plants may find it is not economical to retrofit their plants to meet EPA’s new regulations, and will instead choose to shut
down the plants. In Massachusetts, The
Somerset Power Station last ran in January 2010, and its permits will eventually
expire if it is not restarted, and the owner

TRANSPORTATION
7.6 PERCENT GHG EMISSION REDUCTION
Transportation is second only to buildings in
responsibility for GHG emissions in Massachusetts. The Clean Energy and Climate Plan
for 2020 takes into account state and federal
measures to improve vehicle efficiency,
reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and
increase use of lower-carbon fuels; and
proposes additional measures that will
contribute toward meeting the 2020 limit.

ES-10

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

Federal and California Light Vehicle
Efficiency and GHG Standards
Existing Policy
The EPA and the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) have set
harmonized standards for light-duty MPG
and GHG emissions; raising the fuel efficiency standard from 27.5 MPG at present
to 35.5 MPG for model year 2016. California is expected to propose stricter standards for model year 2017-2020 vehicles,
and Massachusetts law requires the
Commonwealth to adopt the California
standards. In combination, the federal
and California standards are forecasted to
yield a 17 percent reduction in GHG emissions in 2020 (primarily from lower gasoline consumption, but also some reduced
emissions from vehicle air conditioning
systems).

intensity of vehicle fuels falls by a specific
percentage compared to petroleum fuels.
Clean Car Consumer Incentives
New Policy
There are various means by which the
Commonwealth could provide incentives
for consumers to shift their vehicle purchases to more fuel-efficient (or lower
GHG) models. This includes varying the
rates on new car sales taxes, annual auto
excise (property) taxes, and registration
fees, with rates raised on low-MPG
vehicles and reduced on high-MPG ones.
The change could be designed to be
revenue-neutral to consumers as a whole
and to the state. EEA and MassDOT will
conduct a study to examine critical
implementation challenges and possible
regulatory or legislative paths for this
policy.

Federal GHG Emissions and Fuel
Efficiency Standards for Medium- and
Heavy-Duty Vehicles Existing Policy
The EPA and the U.S. Department of
Transportation (DOT) have announced
complementary programs to reduce GHG
emissions and improve fuel efficiency, for
medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such
as the largest pickup trucks and vans,
combination tractors (semis), and all
types and sizes of work trucks and buses
for model years 2014-2018.

Pay As You Drive (PAYD) Auto
Insurance Pilot
New Policy
PAYD would convert a large fixed annual
premium into a variable cost based on
miles traveled, creating a major incentive
to reduce discretionary driving, while cutting the overall cost of insurance due to
fewer accidents. Miles driven would fall
substantially, along with CO2 emissions
and costs for gasoline, accidents, and
congestion. The Commonwealth plans to
conduct a PAYD pilot program initially,
and, depending on results, work with the
insurance industry to make this payment
method more widely available.

Federal Renewable Fuel Standard and
Regional Low Carbon Fuel Standard
(LCFS) Existing Policy
Title II of the federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 creates a
―renewable fuel standard,‖ which requires
an increase in the volume of renewable
fuels used in the U.S. Massachusetts

emissions and have other clean energy
benefits.

motor vehicles, and the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) is developing
regulations to reduce emissions associated with motor vehicle air conditioning
(MVAC). CARB’s standard aims to
minimize emissions by reducing direct
GHG emissions from MVAC systems, by
using low GWP refrigerants and reducing
leaks, as well as improvement in the efficiency of the AC system (e.g., more efficient compressors, fans and motors;
systems that avoid over-chilling and
reheating; and technologies to reduce
heat gain in the passenger cabin).

GreenDOT
New Policy
GreenDOT is MassDOT’s sustainability
initiative, announced through a Policy
Directive by the Secretary of
Transportation in June 2010. GreenDOT is
focused on three related goals: reducing
GHG emissions; promoting the healthy
transportation modes of walking,
bicycling, and public transit; and
supporting smart growth development.
Smart Growth Policy Package
Expanded Policy
Additional ―smart growth‖ would make it
easier for households and businesses to
decrease the number and distance of
vehicle trips, reducing VMT and related
emissions. Massachusetts already has
several policies promoting smart growth,
but new, complementary policies are
necessary to achieve our smart growth
targets. Such policies would focus on influencing infrastructure investments by
state agencies and planning decisions
made by local governments.

Stationary Equipment Refrigerant
Management
New Policy
This policy aims to minimize emissions of
high GWP refrigerants used in nonresidential refrigerating equipment
through: facility registration, leak detection and monitoring, leak repair, system
retrofit and retirement, required service
practices, recordkeeping and reporting,
and eventual replacement with equipment using no-GWP or lower GWP
substances, where such alternatives are
available and practical. The policy would
affect facilities with refrigeration units
containing at least 50 pounds of refrigerant, beginning with a voluntary pilot
program focused on leak detection and
repair.

NON-ENERGY EMISSIONS
2.0 PERCENT GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION
Greenhouse gas emissions not related to
energy use represent a small but important
part of statewide GHG emissions. Although
these sources currently represent only 7
percent of total emissions, many of the
gases emitted by these processes have high
global warming potential (GWP) — thousands
of times greater than CO2. The Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
addresses a number of non-energy sources
of GHG emissions.

Reducing SF6 Emissions from GasInsulated Switchgear
New Policy
Through a pilot program, followed by
possible regulatory action, this policy
aims to minimize emissions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a high GWP substance,
from leakage of gas insulated switchgear
(GIS) used in electricity transmission and
distribution systems by setting limits on
leakage rates and implementing best
management practices for the recovery
and handling of SF6.

mote green procurement, facilitate the
construction of high performance state
buildings, and reduce carbon emissions
across state government. In addition, the
Administration has proposed creation of a
Commonwealth Energy Solutions program
charged with managing and purchasing
low-cost, clean energy across all public
agencies, authorities, and facilities —
providing an integrated strategy for
energy procurement that capitalizes on
economies of scale.

CROSS-CUTTING POLICIES
Several policies pursued under the Clean
Energy and Climate Plan for 2020 do not
neatly fit in the categories of buildings, electricity supply, transportation or non-energy
emissions, but involve state actions that
drive clean energy adoption across all of
these domains.

Green Communities Division
Existing Policy
Created by the GCA, the Green Communities Division of the Department of Energy
Resources (DOER) helps municipalities
become more sustainable, control rising
energy costs, and incubate the clean
energy technologies and practices. Envisioned as a way to encourage municipalities to make greener energy decisions,
the Division offer assistance to municipalities in order to be designated as ―Green
Communities‖ and qualify for grant
funding.

MEPA GHG Policy and Protocol
Expanded Policy
MEPA requires that all major projects proposed in the Commonwealth that have
state involvement (in the form of state
permits, land transfers or financial assistance, for example) undertake an
assessment of project impacts and alternatives in an effort to avoid, minimize and
mitigate damage to the environment to
the maximum extent feasible. Building on
this general requirement, the MEPA GHG
Policy requires that certain projects
undergoing review by the MEPA office
quantify their GHG emissions and identify
measures to avoid, minimize, and
mitigate such emissions.

Consideration of GHG Emissions in
State Permitting, Licensing and Administrative Approvals New Policy
The Global Warming Solutions Act
requires all state agencies, departments,
boards, commissions and authorities to
consider climate change impacts, such as
GHG emissions, when they issue permits,
licenses and other administrative approvals in the context of environmental
review. EEA, in collaboration with other
state and quasi-public agencies, will
develop a plan to implement this
requirement in selected agency actions.

Leading by Example Expanded Policy
The Leading by Example (LBE) Program,
established in April 2007 by Governor
Patrick’s Executive Order No. 484, works
to lower costs and reduce environmental
impacts at all Executive Branch agencies,
public colleges and universities and quasipublic authorities. The program oversees
efforts to reduce energy use by the state’s
buildings and vehicles, expand recycling
programs, cut water consumption, proES-13

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
Executive Summary

The Road to 80 Percent Lower Emissions in 2050
The clean energy economy of 2050 will be
very different than the fossil-fuel dominated
economy of today. With many of the policies
embodied in this Plan in place, 2050 would
find a Massachusetts where energy costs are
less volatile and comprise a smaller part of
budgets. Businesses, households,
municipalities and institutions are better able
to manage their energy needs. Renewable
and alternative sources of energy have
largely displaced fossil-based sources, and a
smart grid and advanced storage
technologies release to the grid as needed
electricity generated during the night by
massive wind farms off the coast of the
Northeast. Both small and large-scale solar
installations are ubiquitous across the state.
National security has been strengthened by
an economy driven by homegrown sources of
energy that no longer depend on fossil fuel
from unstable regions or countries that do
not share the interests of the U.S.

next 40 years. Unlike the 2020 limit, which
can be met with actions that we take here in
Massachusetts, reaching 80 percent
reductions below 1990 emission levels, as
required by the Global Warming Solutions
Act, will mean broad changes that are
beyond the reach of Massachusetts alone.
Between 2010 and 2050, much will change
— in the economy, in federal regulation, and
in technology — that will make possible GHG
emission reductions that would be
unthinkable today. But in imagining — and
planning for — a path to the mandated GHG
emissions reduction of 80 percent in 2050, it
is important to ask now: How do we get
there?
The Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
describes two scenarios — one based on
maximum energy conservation, the other on
widespread switching from fossil fuels to
electricity for transportation, buildings, and
industry, powered by an extremely clean
electricity supply. While there are differences
between the two scenarios — the former
allows marginally greater use of conventional
fuels for meeting the remaining energy
needs after fundamental efficiency
improvements, while the latter allows for
marginally greater energy utilization, as long
as the source is clean — but there is more
that they have in common. Both require
dramatic reductions in energy use to meet
heating, cooling, lighting, transportation, and
production needs, and both require dramatic
shifts in where the energy we use comes
from.

By 2050, the clean energy cluster in
Massachusetts has matured, much as the
biotechnology and health care sectors
matured in the early part of the 21st
century. Massachusetts plays a major role in
the global market for technologies in
offshore wind, solar PV and thermal,
electricity storage and energy management.
Massachusetts architects and engineers are
leaders internationally in green building
design and building energy management.
Massachusetts companies that pioneered
battery technology have robust partnerships
with American, European, Indian and
Chinese car and truck manufacturers.

Although it could not, by itself, get
Massachusetts to the mandated 2050
emissions levels, the Plan contains a number
of policies that produce modest emissions
reductions for 2020 but, if put in place under
the Plan for 2020, will make substantial
contributions to meeting the 2050
requirement. These include advanced

And by law, in 2050, GHG emissions are 80
percent lower than in 1990 and the air

building codes and building energy rating
and labeling, since building stock turns over
slowly. The same is true for smart growth,
which will take many years to reap emissions
dividends in changed transportation
patterns. Also vital will be reducing the
carbon content of vehicle fuels through a low
carbon fuel standard, which will require the
development and widespread
commercialization of advanced, truly lowcarbon biofuels that are not yet in the
marketplace, and/or the near universal
installation of fueling infrastructure for
electric vehicles, which will take time.

innovation and commercialization, company
formation, and job creation up and down the
skill ladder. There will be clean energy jobs
for scientists and engineers, construction
workers and insulation installers, as
Massachusetts develops the products and
services not only needed here, but across
the country and around the world. There will
be opportunities for those displaced by
economic change to retool for a new
industry, and for those long disadvantaged in
the mainstream economy to find a new point
of entry.
Clean energy is an industry of the future, but
for Massachusetts, the future is now.

Conclusion
Developed under the authority of the GWSA
of 2008, the Commonwealth’s Clean Energy
and Climate Plan for 2020 provides the
means for meeting the Secretary’s GHG
emissions reduction requirement of 25
percent in 2020, putting the Commonwealth
on track toward the GWSA’s mandate of 80
percent reduction in 2050 — and
accelerating the development of a clean
energy economy for Massachusetts.
As this Plan is implemented, homeowners
and businesses will discover new ways to
save money on energy costs, make living
and work spaces more comfortable, and
make production processes cleaner and more
efficient. The air we breathe will be cleaner,
and we will be less dependent on energy
from unstable parts of the world. Above all,
we will be putting Massachusetts in a
leadership position in the clean energy
economy of the future.

I. A Clean Energy Revolution

I. A Clean Energy Revolution
Between 2007 and the end of 2010, solar
photovoltaic (PV) systems installed and
scheduled for installation in Massachusetts
increased 20-fold — with jobs in solar
manufacturing, installation, and services
nearly tripling — while installed wind energy
increased 10-fold. In that same time period,
Massachusetts launched the most aggressive
energy efficiency program in the country,
with estimated savings of over $6 billion for
residential, municipal, industrial and
commercial customers and 4,500 jobs
projected. Companies that are saving on
energy costs can devote those dollars to
business development and job expansion.
School districts that cut energy costs can
devote more resources to students.
Homeowners who reduce their energy bills
can spend more on other needs and desires.
By the end of 2010, thousands of new jobs
will have been added in clean energy
services, manufacturing and research and
development (R&D) — this at a time when
the country is undergoing the most severe
economic recession in a generation. Vibrant
high-tech clusters in biofuels, wind energy,
solar power, energy storage, and energy
efficiency services have taken root and are
leading clean energy technology
development globally.

Here in the Commonwealth, the transition to
a clean energy economy has begun — and
has already shown itself to be an engine of
economic growth. Driven by an
entrepreneurial private sector, and an
integrated state framework of legislation,
regulation and executive branch programs,
Massachusetts has launched the clean
energy revolution. Unparalleled academic
and technical resources, local sources of
investment capital, and a highly skilled
workforce are all ingredients of this
revolution — lowering costs to consumers,
increasing our energy independence, growing
clean energy jobs, and reducing our
contribution to climate change and other
environmental impacts. Massachusetts is
poised to lead the transition to a clean
energy economy nationally and to
disproportionately benefit from the economic
development and jobs resulting from that
transition.
It is in this context that the Executive Office
of Energy and Environmental Affairs offers
the Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate
Plan for 2020. The Global Warming Solutions
Act (GWSA) of 2008 requires the Secretary
of Energy and Environmental Affairs to
establish a statewide limit on GHG emissions
of between 10 percent and 25 percent below
1990 levels for 2020, on the way toward 80
percent reduction in emissions by 2050,
along with a plan to achieve the 2020 target.
Secretary Bowles has set that 2020 limit at
25 percent — and the Massachusetts Clean
Energy and Climate Plan for 2020 contains
the measures necessary to meet that limit.
But fulfilling that mandate will do much more
than meet the requirements of the Act. It will
allow the Commonwealth to address a
number of challenges, only one of which is
climate change. Importantly, it will give
powerful impetus to the clean energy
revolution that has already begun. Rather

This is not a vision of a possible future for

than putting a burden on our economy, a
statewide mandate to reduce GHG
emissions, achieved through measures that
are carefully chosen, designed, and
implemented to reduce costs or maximize
job growth, will accelerate the transition to a
clean energy economy that has already
taken hold across the state.

Energy Independence
Massachusetts is at the end of the energy
pipeline, figuratively and literally. All of our
fossil-based energy sources — oil, natural
gas, and coal — are derived from other
regions of the country (e.g., the Gulf Coast
or Western states) and other parts of the
world, many of them unstable or hostile to
the United States, (e.g., countries in the
Middle East and Venezuela). Thus, all
spending on fossil fuel energy — whether to
fuel power plants, buildings, or vehicles —
flows out of state and fails to provide income
to in-state businesses or employees. This
exported economic value is significant,
totaling almost $22 billion in 2008.5 To put
this is at a smaller scale, in 2008, an
average Massachusetts household spent
about $5,200 for energy costs, of which
about $1,700 was for heating (space and
water), $1,300 for electricity, and $2,200 for
gasoline. Almost all of these expenditures
leave Massachusetts.

Energy Costs and Volatility
In addition to the economic drain
represented by Massachusetts dollars flowing
out of the state for energy resources, energy
consumers have experienced wild price
swings and long term energy price increases.
Figures 1-3 show both steadily increasing
and volatile prices for the cost of natural gas,
electricity and gasoline.

As has been experienced numerous times in
the past decades, events in other regions
and countries drive global energy markets
and prices, often to the detriment of
Massachusetts consumers and businesses.

China and India for petroleum products
resulted in some of the most rapid increases
in energy prices that Massachusetts has
experienced. Basic service electricity prices
quadrupled between 1998 and 2008, before
dropping at the onset of the global recession.
The price of home heating oil peaked at
$4.71 per gallon in 2008 and regular
gasoline topped $4 a gallon. Over the past
decade, price shocks have forced
Massachusetts consumers, businesses and
governments to struggle with an increasing

should be the disproportionate beneficiary as
the economy becomes cleaner and greener.
This is, in fact, already happening, as clean
energy innovations developed at academic
centers such as the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) and the University of
Massachusetts translate into products and
companies, and as laws, regulations, and
incentive programs developed under
Governor Patrick have created or expanded
markets in Massachusetts for clean energy
products and services. A study earlier this
year by Clean Edge, Inc. found that
Massachusetts has become the leading state
on the East Coast for clean energy
innovation, investment, deployment, and

Massachusetts already has a core of
companies and jobs in clean energy, and this
industry has been growing even during
challenging economic times. According to a
Massachusetts Clean Energy Center
(MassCEC) survey of 471 local companies,
more than 11,000 people are employed in
clean energy at the end of 2010, up 65
percent since 2007. Some 3,500 people are
employed in manufacturing of energy
efficiency products, with growth of 20
percent since 2007, and the fastest growth
(67 percent) in energy storage, represented
by such companies as A123 Systems, Inc.,
Beacon Power, and Premium Power.
Jobs in solar manufacturing, installation, and

In addition to solar power, which has
boomed from 3.5 megawatts (MW) at the
start of 2007 to over 75 MW installed or
slated for installation at the end of 2010 (see
Figure 4), wind power is another local energy
resource — and opportunity for economic
growth. Governor Patrick has set a goal of
2,000 MW of wind — enough to power
800,000 homes — by 2020 (see Figure 5 on
page 5). Much of that will come from
offshore wind — the greatest renewable
energy resource available to Massachusetts.
At 468 MW, Cape Wind will be the first
offshore wind project in the United States,
and installation — which will be based in a
new port facility in New Bedford — will create
600 to 1,000 jobs. Siemens AG, one of the
world’s largest manufacturers of wind
turbines, has located its U.S. offshore wind
headquarters in Boston, because of its
contract to supply Cape Wind with 130
turbines, and EEW Group of Germany, a
leading maker of foundations for offshore
wind, has partnered with Middleboro-based
Mass Tank Corp. to supply monopile
foundations and other structural components

With nation-leading firms such as

Noresco based in Massachusetts,
employment in energy efficiency services has
nearly doubled, from 1,000 in 2007 to 1,972
in 2010 in just the 69 firms that responded
to the MassCEC survey — representing just
one fifth of energy efficiency services

information indicates similar growth is taking
place across the Commonwealth’s energy
efficiency sector.
This growth should accelerate in the coming
years, thanks in part to state initiatives,
including those contained in this report.

facility in Massachusetts.

Reducing energy use through efficiency and
conservation — for both buildings and
vehicles — cuts living costs for households
and expenses for business, improving
prosperity and creating jobs. Efficiency relies
more heavily on local labor and companies
than do fossil-fuel based industries.
Efficiency programs not only create
employment directly, but households and
companies will spend their energy cost
savings at other businesses within the state,
creating ―indirect‖ and ―induced‖ jobs and
economic growth. Renewable energy
facilities tend to be more capital-intensive,
but also provide many local jobs in
construction.

The Wind Technology Testing Center
(WTTC), now under construction in
Charlestown, will also bolster Massachusetts’
emerging role as a center for wind energy
advancement and jobs. Backed by a $25
million grant from the DOE, the WTTC will be
the first facility in the United States capable
of testing the large-scale (up to 90 meters
long) wind turbine blades that represent the
next generation of wind energy technology,
specifically applicable to offshore
installations. The WTTC has already attracted
TPI Composites, Inc. a leading manufacturer
of turbine blades, to establish an R&D facility
in Fall River. Devens-based American
Superconductor Corp. is engaged in
development of technology for ever-larger
wind turbines (a 10 MW turbine is now under
development), and Massachusetts-based
ePower LLC was acquired by Vestas
Technology R&D Americas, Inc., one of the
world’s largest wind turbine companies, for
its direct drive technology. With support from
the MassCEC, FloDesign Wind Turbine
Corporation — another ―transformational
energy technology‖ grant winner — has
established a new facility in Waltham, with a
promise of creating 150 new jobs as it brings
its innovative ―shrouded‖ wind turbine design
to market.

In addition to companies that are providing
the new technologies of the clean energy
future, Massachusetts also has thousands of
individuals and small companies who are
taking risks and making investments to
power their businesses with smaller scale
energy installations to provide energy
stability, diversification, and in some cases
powering back to the grid. In the last four
years, these entrepreneurs have invested in
small-scale anaerobic digestion, solar
thermal, low head hydro and geothermal.

A number of the most important policies in
this Plan will cause large reductions in fossil
fuel use in buildings, electricity generation,
and transportation. These include energy
efficiency programs, building codes,
requirements for increased renewable
electricity generation, federal vehicle
efficiency standards, state incentives for
purchasing more efficient vehicles, incentives
to reduce vehicle miles traveled, and ―smart
growth‖ policies. Through both direct and
indirect impacts, we estimate that these
policies will create 36,000 jobs in

we import. To the degree that the
Commonwealth can continue and expand its
leadership in clean energy R&D,
manufacturing, and service provision (such
as Massachusetts companies that operate
energy efficiency programs across the
nation), the employment gains could be
significantly larger than shown in the table
on page 7. However, projecting such
changes in industry growth is difficult, and
beyond the scope of the modeling conducted
for this Plan.

The estimate for employment from in-state
demand for renewable energy in
Massachusetts in 2020 is 6,000 to 12,000
full-time jobs.
The figures for transportation, efficiency and
renewables are based on employment
needed to cover in-state demand for these
clean energy sectors. They do not include

The figure for renewables is given as a range, because most of the value-added for renewables is in manufacturing, and
the degree to which renewable components will be manufactured in the Commonwealth is fluid at this time, as is the
degree to which the state’s 2020 renewable energy requirements will be met from in-state sources.

Massachusetts, but in other states and
nationally. One study, conducted at the
UMass Amherst, estimated that $100 billion
of national spending directed toward the
green economy would create approximately
2 million jobs through both direct and
indirect effects, compared to only 540,000
jobs if the same amount of money continued
to be spent on oil, natural gas, and

impressive entrepreneurial history, and it is
that spirit — fueled by the intellect and
innovation of world-class academic centers
such as Harvard, MIT, and UMass, and
catalyzed by the state’s nation-leading clean
energy policies — that will continue to propel
the Commonwealth forward.

Climate Change
The international consensus on climate
released in 2007 by the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found that
the ―warming of the climate system is
unequivocal, as is now evident from
observations of increases in global average
air and ocean temperatures, widespread
melting of snow and ice, and rising global
average sea level.‖12 There is broad
agreement and high confidence that the
documented increase in GHG concentrations
is changing the earth’s climate — not only
raising average global temperatures but
altering regional and local climatic and
weather patterns. Observed effects of
climate change include: increased
atmospheric and ocean temperatures, heat
waves, increased evaporation and changes in
precipitation patterns, and a greater
intensity of storms, floods, and droughts.
Thermal expansion of a warmer ocean and
the melting of glaciers are contributing to a
rise in sea level. These trends are expected
to continue for a minimum of several
decades even if GHG emissions are reduced.

Another recent study, ―Green Jobs/Green
Homes New York,‖ estimated the economic
impacts of conducting energy efficiency
retrofits of one million housing units over the
course of five years. It found that the
program would cut home energy
consumption by 30 percent to 40 percent,
save New York households $1 billion annually
in energy bills, and create about 120,000
―job years‖ (one year’s worth of
employment, reflecting that many of these
would be temporary construction jobs). Half
of these jobs would be direct results of the
retrofit activity and half would come from the
re-spending of increased incomes throughout
the New York economy.11
In short, the private sector has already
grasped the potential huge revenue growth
by capitalizing on the Commonwealth’s
emerging clean energy policies and

and nitrous oxide are primarily due to
agriculture. Carbon dioxide is the most
important anthropogenic (human induced)
GHG. Globally, CO2 concentrations have
reached 385 parts per million (ppm) — about
105 ppm greater than during pre-industrial
times. The increasing atmospheric CO2 and
other heat trapping greenhouse gases are
causing an increase in the earth’s air
temperatures. Eleven of the 12 warmest
years on record have occurred in the period
between 1995 and 2006.13 A recent study by
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) indicated that the
summer of 2010 tied with 1998 as the
warmest global temperature on record.

average of 14.1°C (57.5°F).14
In order to understand the potential impacts
of climate change in Massachusetts, EEA
undertook a year-long study driven by the
Climate Adaptation Advisory Committee, a
body created by the GWSA to advise the
Secretary on adaptation strategies.15 The
Adaptation Advisory Committee found that
Massachusetts’ climate is already changing
and will continue to change over the course
of this century. Under the IPCC’s high
emissions scenario, by the end of the
century Massachusetts is set to experience a
3° to 5°C (5° to 10°F) increase in average
ambient temperature16; summer
temperatures would feel like the current
summer climate of the Carolinas. Days with
temperatures greater than 32°C (90°F) are
predicted to increase from the five to 20
days a year that Massachusetts presently
experiences to between 30 and 60 days each
year (IPCC, 2007). Sea surface temperatures
are predicted to increase by 4°C (8°F) (IPCC,
2007); precipitation is expected to increase
in winter months by 12 percent to 30
percent, but will fall mostly in the form of
rain5; and the number of snow days is
predicted to decrease from five each month
to one to three each month. Finally, while no
single event can be entirely attributed to
global warming, a warming climate is
increasing the likelihood of more extreme
weather. The Northeast has recently
experienced major storms, with notable

depend on overall ecosystem health,
including fisheries, agriculture, and
recreation. These impacts include:

Massachusetts is vulnerable to severe
impacts from climate change. Impacts to
natural resources include:

Fisheries
As ocean temperatures continue to rise,
the range of suitable habitat in the
Northeast for many commercially
important fish and shellfish species, such
as cod and lobster, is projected to shift
northward. Certain fisheries will decline in
productivity, impacting the economic
viability of fishing-related industries.
Temperature, precipitation, nutrient, and
salinity changes will result in a loss of
habitat for marine species, altering the
location or productivity of commercial
and recreational fishing.

Coastal
Substantial increases in the extent and
frequency of coastal flooding and
increased risk of severe storm-related
damage.
Permanent inundation of low-lying
coastal areas and increased shoreline
erosion and wetland loss due to projected
sea-level rise and increased wave action.

Rivers and wetlands
Alteration of stream flow timing and
volumes due to precipitation changes,
punctuated by increased winter flooding
events and longer low-flow periods.
Degraded water quality and quantity,
habitat loss, and increased sedimentation
and pollution of waterways due to
precipitation changes, higher
temperatures, and more frequent
droughts.
Changes in temperature will lead to shifts
in wetlands species and types and/or
composition, changes to wetland soils
that could result in increased erosion,
decreased species diversity, and reduced
groundwater recharge capabilities.

Agriculture
Changes to growing seasons, frequency
and duration of droughts, increased
frequency of extreme precipitation
events, and heat stress will make some
areas unsuitable for growing popular
varieties of produce (e.g., apples,
cranberries), depress milk production
from dairy cows, and increase irrigation
needs to maintain viable crop production.
A longer growing season may allow
farmers to experiment with new crops,
but many traditional farm operations in
the region will become unsustainable
without adaptation strategies that could
be costly, impacting already narrow profit
margins.

Forests
Certain species may succumb to climate
stress, increased competition, and other
pressures, resulting in trickle-down
impacts to dependent bird and animal
species, increasing vulnerability to
invasives and pests.
A shift northward of suitable habitat by
350 to 500 miles is expected for most of
the Northeast region’s tree species.

Recreation
Global warming is projected to profoundly
affect winter recreation and tourism in
the Northeast as winter temperatures
continue to rise and snow cover declines.
With warmer winters, the average ski and
snowboard season will decrease and
operation costs will increase with greater
requirements for artificial snow making.

Climate change will also impact a number of
business sectors in Massachusetts that

10

Infrastructure/developed land

measures to help decrease the state’s
vulnerability and increase resilience.

Climate change will also profoundly impact
the built environment such as energy
infrastructure, transportation, water supply,
wastewater and stormwater, dam safety and
flood control, solid and hazardous waste, and
telecommunications.

Impacts of Local and Regional Air
Pollution
In addition to causing climate change,
emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels
result in a range of negative human health
and ecosystem impacts.

Key infrastructure and development that
is located along the coast will particularly
be affected by storm surges, sea level
rise, and salt water intrusion. The 100year coastal storm floodplain can get
shifted further inland.
Inland, the predicted changes in
precipitation patterns and more frequent
and intensive precipitation events will
inundate development that is located in
the floodplains.
Increased temperature can affect the
structural integrity of many elements of
the built environment.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) has established health-based National
Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for
six pervasive pollutants that have welldocumented health and environmental
impacts: ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), particulate matter (PM),
lead, and carbon monoxide (CO). The
federally regulated pollutant of greatest
concern in Massachusetts is ozone.
Ozone concentrations in Massachusetts
exceed the health-based NAAQS due to a
combination of locally generated emissions
(particularly from vehicles), and the
transport of pollutants from states to the
south and west of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts’ overall air quality has
improved significantly over the last 25 years.
Nonetheless, ozone concentrations in the
Commonwealth regularly exceed the national
standards, despite the adoption of a wide
range of control programs that have reduced
emissions of the pollutants that contribute to
ozone.

Human Health
Higher temperatures and intensive and
increased precipitation events impact human
health (especially the most vulnerable
populations) both directly and indirectly.
Higher temperatures including extreme
heat days will increase heat stress,
impact those with respiratory and
cardiovascular conditions, increase ozone
and particulate matter production
resulting in poor air quality, and increase
pollen production.
Increased runoff from precipitation
events can degrade surface water
quality, increase outbreaks of waterborne diseases, and result in more algal
blooms.

Exposures to each of the criteria pollutants
have been linked to adverse health effects.
For example, ozone can irritate the
respiratory system, causing coughing, throat
irritation, chest pain and reduced lung
function. Ozone also can aggravate asthma,
leading to more asthma attacks and
increased hospital admissions and
emergency room visits for respiratory
problems. Fine PM is associated with a
number of serious health effects including
aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular
disease reflected in increased hospital

There is compelling evidence that the
Northeast’s climate has already begun to
change, with additional changes predicted to
unfold over the next century. All of these will
require the implementation of adaptation

11

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020

admissions, emergency room visits and
premature mortality.

dry out and by washing away calcium and
other minerals essential for plant growth.
Exposure to ozone is associated with a range
of adverse impacts to vegetation, including
impairment of tree growth and loss of
agricultural crop yield. Ozone can increase
the rate of water loss by trees causing
forests to drain streams and soils of water,
thus stressing natural ecosystems beyond
the trees themselves. Ozone interferes with
photosynthesis, thus reducing carbon
capture by trees, affecting the efficiency of
large forested areas to act as carbon sinks.

In its 2010 proposed Transport Rule,17 EPA
proposes to reduce emissions from power
plants in 32 eastern states. In the proposal,
EPA concludes that reducing the emissions
from power plants that contribute to ozone
and fine PM pollution will lead to significant
health benefits. EPA estimates that the
national benefits, which include the value of
avoiding approximately 14,000 to 36,000
premature deaths, 22,000 nonfatal heart
attacks, 11,000 hospitalizations for
respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, 1.8
million lost work days, 100,000 school
absences, and 10 million days when adults
restrict normal activities because of
respiratory symptoms exacerbated by fine
PM and ozone pollution, significantly
outweigh the costs of the emission
reductions.18

Meeting Challenges, Seizing
Opportunities
At roughly 2 percent of the U.S. economy
and 1.3 percent of the nation’s GHG
emissions, Massachusetts could not, on its
own, stop global climate change even if it
reduced statewide emissions to zero
instantly. But the severity of the climate
change challenge requires leadership at
every level, and Massachusetts is in a
position to show the way toward a clean
energy economy through the development of
smart, targeted policies that reduce
emissions by promoting greater energy
efficiency, developing renewable energy, and
encouraging other alternatives to the
combustion of fossil fuels. There are
opportunities to reduce emissions this way
across the economy, and Massachusetts
should continue to be a leader in identifying
and capitalizing on those opportunities.

Since air pollution levels are highly sensitive
to weather, climate change may significantly
affect our overall air quality. For example,
ozone is formed in warm weather, so higher
summer temperatures may result in
increased ozone concentrations in
Massachusetts. Climate-driven increases in
global and regional wild fires and duststorms and changes in precipitation may
impact PM concentrations in Massachusetts.
Criteria pollutants also damage ecosystems.
Acid rain is created when SO2 and NOx
emissions mix with water in the atmosphere.
Acid rain lowers the pH levels of lakes,
rivers, and soils, harming fish and
invertebrates. It damages forest ecosystem
health by making plant roots more likely to

But, more importantly, Massachusetts can
make use of the climate change imperative
to get off the fossil fuel rollercoaster, become
more energy independent, and jump start its
economy with new technologies, new
companies, and new jobs. The
Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate
Plan for 2020 will put Massachusetts on a
path to meeting its statutory obligation to
reduce GHG emissions, and on the road to a
vibrant clean energy economy.

II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies
The GWSA gives broad authority to the state
to choose policy tools — from targeted
technology-specific policies to economy-wide
market-based policies — to advance a clean
energy economy while reducing GHG
emissions. Since the passage of the Act in
2008, the interagency technical team, the
Climate Protection and Green Economy
Advisory Committee, and an outside group of
consulting experts in energy, transportation,
buildings, and industrial emissions have
analyzed a wide range of policies and
explored other states’ and other countries’
efforts to make concrete steps toward a clean
energy economy. Public comments collected
during hearings held through the summer of
2010 focused on policy choices, design and
outcomes.

programs where practical and develop new
complementary policies that could accelerate
clean energy growth and lower GHG
emissions. Each of the policies presented in
this section underwent rigorous analysis that
focused on criteria established by the Act and
input from the public hearings and Advisory
Committee: GHG reductions, costeffectiveness, energy cost mitigation, job
growth, equity, implementability, and cobenefits.
The portfolio of policies that follow are those
deemed most likely to reach our clean energy
and climate goals. Some can be put in place
immediately; others will be tested through
pilot programs, with those that show the best
results ultimately implemented statewide
through regulation or legislation, as needed.
Depending on actual (as opposed to
projected) results, not every one of these
policies must be implemented to its fullest
extent in order to achieve the 2020 mandate.
But these represent the suite of policies that
the Patrick-Murray Administration is
committed to pursuing over the next four
years as we build on the foundation created in
the past four years and work toward the 2020
emissions limit set by the Secretary.

In weighing the different paths forward, it
became clear that an integrated portfolio
approach plays best to Massachusetts’
strengths and, taken as a whole, has the
greatest likelihood of reaching the goals of
addressing energy costs, energy security and
independence, and reducing GHG emissions in
the absence of broad federal action on climate
and clean energy. In the last four years
Massachusetts has demonstrated the
effectiveness of a portfolio approach: a
combination of legislation, executive actions
and private sector entrepreneurship has
aligned incentives and created opportunities
for clean energy growth and GHG reductions.
Successful energy efficiency programs, solar
incentives, building codes, transportation
planning, ocean planning and green jobs
training are tailored to the Masaschusetts
economic and workforce landscape. The
portfolio that the state has built in the last
four years is greater than the sum of its
parts, working synergistically to launch the
Commonwealth on a path to GHG reductions
of 18 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.

This portfolio is divided into five categories:
buildings, energy supply, transportation, nonenergy emissions, and cross-cutting policies.
Each policy is labeled as either ―Existing‖,
―Expanded‖ or ―New‖. Existing policies are
those that were put in place prior to our Draft
Implementation Plan in June of 2010. An
example is the energy efficiency programs
that started with the passage of the Green
Communities Act of 2008. Expanded policies
are those that build on already existing
policies and exand their scope. An example is
Smart Growth policies. New policies are those
that have not yet been initiated or were
begun since June of 2010. The GreenDot
policy is an example of a new policy.

The directive from the EEA Secretary was to

results in both high heating energy use20 and
high average fuel costs. For existing
buildings, energy improvements can be
encouraged through financial incentives,
access to financing, and rating of building
energy performance. For new buildings,
energy performance can be moved to higher
standards through advanced building energy
codes.

Buildings

In addition to eliminating energy waste in
buildings, there is a significant opportunity to
transition to cleaner energy sources. For
example, oil heating can be replaced by solar
thermal, sustainable biomass/biofuels, or
heat pumps, while electricity supply can be
shifted from fossil fuels such as coal and oil
to wind and hydro.21

Buildings consume more than 50 percent of
the energy used in Massachusetts and are
therefore responsible for the greatest GHG
emissions of any sector; 49 percent of GHGs,
including over 21 percent from direct fuel
use excluding electricity. Energy use in
buildings comes from these two primary
areas: 1) fuels for heating, primarily natural
gas and heating oil, and 2) electricity for air
conditioning, lighting, ventilation, appliances
and equipment. The character of energy use
in the buildings sector overall is determined
by three factors: the amount and location of
existing and new building space in use, the
energy performance of these buildings, and
the choice of energy sources. There are
several effective approaches for enabling
changes, primarily related to the latter two
factors.19 The issue of location is covered in
the transportation chapter.

Massachusetts began to address many of
these opportunities through the Zero Net
Energy Buildings Task Force, created by
Governor Deval Patrick in 2008. This
stakeholder group, made up of energy and
building industry professionals working with
the DOER, released a roadmap for the state
called Getting to Zero22 in March 2009.
The Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
takes into account Massachusetts’ nationleading energy efficiency efforts mandated
by the Green Communities Act of 2008,
which will produce substantial GHG
reductions for 2020, and proposes additional
measures that will contribute toward meeting
the 2020 limit set as part of implementation
of the GWSA.

Global, national and regional studies have
consistently pointed to energy efficiency and
improved energy performance of residential
and commercial buildings as the largest and
most cost-effective clean energy
opportunities. This is particularly true in the
Northeast, where the combination of a cold
climate and heavy reliance on heating oil

The Northeast census region uses 16% more energy
per capita than the U.S. average, due largely to having
46% more heating degree days than the U.S. average.

19

In general, the amount of building space is driven by
broader trends such as economic growth, Federal policy
relating to real estate and capital markets, and personal
preferences. Innovations such as e-commerce,
virtualization, and telepresence (telecommuting and
teleconferencing) could one day substantially change the
amount of building space in use.

Electricity supply is discussed further in a separate
chapter.

All Cost-Effective Energy Efficiency

expected lifetime ranging from 30 to more
than 300 years. The design of buildings
newly built today and in coming years will
have a large and lasting impact on fossil fuel
use and corresponding GHG and local air
pollution emissions.

With the Governor’s signing of the Green
Communities Act (GCA) of 2008,
Massachusetts embarked on a path to
greatly increase investments in — and return
on investments from — building energy
improvements. From 2010 to 2012 — the
first three year plan approved by the
Department of Public Utilities (DPU) under
the GCA mandate to capture all costeffective energy efficiency opportunities —
the state will invest more than $2 billion,
with an anticipated return of over $6 billion
in savings for customers.

Massachusetts has already adopted a
pathway to greater energy efficiency in
building codes through a commitment in the
Green Communities Act of 2008 to adopt the
latest International Energy Conservation
Code (IECC) from the International Code
Council (ICC), the body that develops and
maintains model building codes for the
United States. In addition to this energy
code baseline, which updates every three
years, the Massachusetts Board of Building
Regulations and Standards (BBRS) adopted a
local-option ‖stretch‖ energy code for
municipalities in 2009. Over 60
municipalities in Massachusetts have already
adopted this higher-efficiency code. More
significantly, ―stretch‖ is now approaching
the norm: The 2009 stretch code for
commercial buildings recently became the
basis for the 2012 IECC code for commercial
buildings, the largest improvement in the
energy efficiency of the national model code
in its 35 year history.

Under the Massachusetts Clean Energy and
Climate Plan for 2020, additional changes
need to be implemented to maximize
emissions reductions through energy
efficiency. For example, deep energy
improvements, which substantially improve
building energy performance, should be
encouraged in a way they are not in the
existing program structure. Commercial and
industrial buildings heated with fuel oil
should have access to energy efficiency
programs in the same way that residential
buildings do. Finally, new measures, such as
tree planting and retention that can reduce
heating and cooling loads over the longterm, even if not so much for 2020, should
be supported.

The Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate
Plan for 2020 proposes to move away from
the traditional approach of ‖prescriptive‖
codes, which set minimum standards for
each building component or system, and
toward ‖performance‖ or ‖outcome-based‖
codes, which set a maximum energy usage
criterion for buildings but allow flexibility to
meet that criterion in any number of ways.
The Massachusetts stretch code has
spearheaded ―performance-based‖ energy
codes, through performance targets and
testing requirements for new homes and
through energy modeling requirements for
large commercial buildings.

Performance-based Energy Codes
In addition to achieving energy efficency
upgrades in existing structures, the
Commonwealth needs to set standards for
construction and rehabilitation that ensure
higher energy performance. New
construction in Massachusetts accounts for
additions and turnover of around 0.75
percent a year in the total building stock for
residential units and 1 percent for
commercial space. That translates into
turnover of 7 percent to 10 percent of the
building stock through 2020, and 30 percent40 percent by 2050. These buildings have an

15

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

By shifting to performance-driven energy
codes that get progressively more effective
in reducing energy needs, new construction
in 2020 will use half the energy of the same
buildings under a business-as-usual scenario.
This results in a total savings over the
coming decade of 30 percent to 40 percent
of the expected energy use from new
construction in residential and commercial
sectors, with similar reductions in their total
GHG emissions by 2020. Each year this
number compounds, making it a critical
component of any 2050 plan.

performance of the building under average
tenant use. The DOER has been working with
a team from both the public and private
sectors to design a commercial building
energy rating program, with plans to launch
a pilot in eastern Massachusetts in 2011.

Solar Thermal Water and Space Heating
While water and space heating together
account for around half of total building
energy use and carbon emissions in
Massachusetts, it does not require very highgrade fuels (unlike powering aircraft and
motor vehicles for example). These large but
low intensity heating needs make them
excellent candidates for active solar heating
which has no fuel expense, and can provide
significant heating from a small roof, wall or
ground-mounted system. Unlike in the
1970’s, the technology for active solar
thermal heating is now mature and comes
with decade-long warrantees to protect the
up-front investment in a solar thermal
system. This technology has been broadly
adopted and even required in new
construction in places as varied as Hawaii,
Cyprus, Israel, and Austria (where there is
less solar radiation available per square foot
than in Massachusetts). However, the
market for solar thermal in New England is
currently small, and needs support to reach
maturity and become a broadly viable option
for new and existing construction alike. Solar
thermal is only one of several renewable
thermal technologies that over time can
replace a growing portion of our heating
needs that are currently met with fossil fuels.

Energy Rating and Labeling of Buildings
In addition, this Plan proposes to use energy
rating and labeling of buildings to create
greater markets for energy-saving
investments in existing structures. Currently,
there is little data available on the energy
use of existing buildings, which prevents
buyers and renters — and their lenders —
from placing a value on the energy
performance of spaces. Under this Plan,
Massachusetts proposes to pilot and then
broadly deploy residential building energy
labeling that allows apples-to-apples
comparisons of home energy performance in
much the same way that miles per gallon
(MPG) ratings allow fuel efficiency
comparisons of cars and light trucks. A pilot
program in western Massachusetts beginning
in 2011 will seek to integrate this new
information on energy use into the real
estate marketplace through Multiple Listing
Service listings and trainings for contractors,
realtors and home appraisers. In addition,
Massachusetts will develop a commercial
building rating pilot that would deploy both
operational energy ratings (based on utility
energy bills and the EPA Energy Star
Portfolio Manager program) and asset ratings
(similar to home energy ratings or vehicle
miles-per-gallon) ratings. These two forms of
ratings reveal to prospective tenants what
impact on energy use previous tenants have
had, as well as the inherent energy

Existing Policy
ALL COST-EFFECTIVE ENERGY EFFICIENCY
Policy summary: With the Governor’s signing of the Green Communities Act of 2008,
Massachusetts embarked on a path toward significant energy improvements in homes and
commercial buildings. The Act required that the electric and gas utilities pursue all cost-effective
energy efficiency, i.e. eliminating energy waste whenever it is cheaper to do so than buying
additional supply. From 2010 to 2012 — the duration of the first three year plan — the state will
invest more than $2 billion, with an anticipated return of over $6 billion for participants. The
program is administered by the investor-owned utilities in the state and the Cape Light Compact,
together known as Program Administrators (PAs). The PAs work under the guidance of the Energy
Efficency Advisory Council (EEAC), which represents a broad range of stakeholders.

Clean energy economy impacts: From 2010 to 2020, the program will induce investments of
$10.2 billion in buildings, creating approximately 19,600 jobs in 2020. In addition, the program
will generate $17.5 billion in net benefits, largely in avoided future costs of energy and avoided
energy system expansion. These savings will largely enter the local economy rather than flowing
out of state and out of the country, while reducing living costs for residents and operating costs
for businesses.
Rationale: A substantial amount of energy efficiency is cheaper than energy supplies now
provided by coal, oil, natural gas, and nuclear power. However, due to various market barriers,
investments in energy efficiency fall short of optimal, either for an individual organization or for

6.7 million tons is based on expansion of the efficiency programs since 2008, due to the Green Communities Act. The
program savings from levels of efficiency spending prior to 2008 are excluded, since the emissions trend in the Business
as Usual (BAU) projection is estimated to include them.
24

Energy savings in 2020 are based on the full value of efficiency programs, including the spending levels that existed
prior to 2008, in order to be consistent with DOER required reporting to the Department of Public Utilities (this differs
from the calculation of GHG savings, as discussed in prior footnote).

discount rate. Includes savings from 2010 to 2020 from the full value of efficiency programs, to be consistent with DOER
required reporting to the DPU. DPU order 08-50-A directs programs to use a discount rate pegged to the 10-year Treasury
note over the previous year. Rather than vary the rate year by year, 2.5 percent was used as a reasonable approximation
of the real Treasury rate historically.
26

Approximately 10,300 jobs from electric efficiency, 7,000 from gas efficiency, and 2,300 from heating oil efficiency.
More than two-thirds of the employment gains are ―indirect‖ and ―induced‖ — due to lower energy bills causing greater
respending of household and business incomes within the Massachusetts economy, and to purchases by efficiency-related
companies from other businesses in the state.

the state as a whole. The PAs, as a primary point of contact with customers on energy, are wellsuited to incentivize customers to undertake building energy improvements. Participation in
energy efficiency could be increased greatly.
Policy design and issues: The PAs, with guidance from the EEAC and DOER, attempt to reduce
consumption of electricity, natural gas, and heating oil by conducting energy assessments on
buildings, and providing financial incentives for customers to implement a variety of efficiency
measures, such as installing higher-efficiency lighting, HVAC systems and appliances; adding
insulation to attics, walls, and basements; and reducing air leakage from buildings. Both technical
and financial assistance are provided to developers of new buildings, such as the Energy Star
Homes program and customized project support for commercial buildings.
There are a variety of market barriers that make achievement of all cost-effective efficiency a
challenge. One of these is customers’ lack of up-front capital to pay for efficiency investments,
and the PAs are currently addressing this through providing subsidized financing, targeted to
different types of customers. Another is the ―split incentive‖ problem for rental space, when a
tenant is paying the utility bills but only the owner has the ability to invest in efficiency measures.
Efforts are also being made to address this issue.
GHG impact: The programs will reduce emissions by 6.7 million tons in 2020.
Other benefits: By reducing fossil fuel combustion, the program will help reduce criteria
pollutants and other hazardous air pollutants, providing public health and environmental benefits.
Cost: From 2010 to 2020, the electricity, natural gas, and oil efficiency programs will generate
$27.7 billion of energy savings, at a cost of $10.2 billion, yielding $17.5 billion in net benefits for
the state, largely in avoided future costs of energy and energy system expansion.
Experience in other states: Many states have energy efficiency programs operated by utilities
within a similar framework. Massachusetts’ program is one of the most well established in the
nation, and its 2010-12 plan represents the largest per capita investment in energy efficiency in
the country.
Uncertainty: It remains uncertain how much energy efficiency there is to be captured and what
program elements will capture it.

ADVANCED BUILDING ENERGY CODES
Policy summary: Massachusetts recently adopted a requirement that building energy codes
meet or exceed the latest International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) and stay current with
its three-year update cycle. In addition, the Commonwealth developed one of the first ―stretch‖
energy codes, which moves away from the traditional code approach that prescribes specific
energy measures that must be installed (levels of insulation, methods for air sealing, etc.), toward a ―performance‖ oriented code that mandates a percentage reduction in total building
energy use, while allowing developers to make their own design choices on how to achieve that
reduction. This policy would complete the transition to performance-based codes by 2020 that go
beyond the IECC codes in terms of efficiency while reducing their complexity.

Clean energy economy impacts: Building construction is one of the largest economic sectors
in the U.S. and is a major employer of skilled labor, with excellent potential for clean energy job
growth. Between now and 2020 new construction is estimated to account for 7 percent to 10 percent of the total building stock. In addition, major renovations of existing buildings trigger code
compliance requirements, and this will affect a significant percentage of buildings. The avoided
fuel and electric costs due to enhanced codes will cut the long-term operational costs of this real
estate and increase its durability. In addition, these projects will require more energy and design
expertise, generating clean energy jobs in these sectors. In taking a leadership position on
energy efficient design and construction Massachusetts-based firms are also likely to become
national leaders in green design and to grow demand for their services in the increasingly global
building design and engineering sector.
Rationale: Massachusetts has recently moved to the forefront of a national shift toward greater
energy efficiency in building codes. This growing attention is due to the underlying economics,
emphasized in analyses such as the McKinsey climate studies which point to modernized energy
codes as one of the most cost-effective climate mitigation strategies.28 Further, given the long
lifespan of the building stock, decisions made today determine energy demands of the buildings
sector for the rest of the century and beyond.
Massachusetts has the opportunity to build on its recent leadership in energy codes by developing
a clear roadmap for both residential and commercial code reform over the next decade. Clear and
bold action can ensure that we put ourselves on a path to zero-net energy buildings, and provide

improved competitiveness for our nation-leading design, construction and developer
communities.
The shift from prescriptive codes that try indirectly to reduce energy waste, to performancebased codes that directly measure and reduce energy waste, is one of the clearest ways to improve energy codes. Historically it was not possible to meaningfully measure or model the energy
use of residential or commercial buildings, but the advance of diagnostic tools such as duct-testing equipment, blower doors, and infra-red cameras have revolutionized that process for residential buildings. In larger commercial building spaces, the sophistication of energy models has
grown rapidly.
Design issues: Building energy codes are relatively complex, particularly for commercial buildings, and there are numerous stakeholders across the design and construction supply chain to
factor into the rate of improvement that is possible. The early ―windfall‖ gains come from redirecting the emphasis of the energy code to more directly drive improvements in energy performance. Once these gains have been achieved the rate of progress will depend somewhat on design innovation and the appropriate application of new technologies that respond to marketplace
demands. The dominant commercial building types are also the ones with the most turnover in
real estate markets: office, retail and lab space and multi-family rental housing. The Commonwealth is looking to pilot programs in these sectors first, and to initially focus code improvement
efforts there.
On the residential side the pathway to zero-net energy homes has already been paved by several
industry-leading builders, who build and sell net-zero homes at both market and affordable
housing prices. However, the broader market transition will take time, a focused set of building
codes, and a supporting framework of training, outreach and technical assistance. More than a
third of new residential construction in Massachusetts voluntarily adopted the Home Energy Rating System (HERS) index in 2009, and this has been complemented by more than 60 communities opting into the ―stretch‖ energy code. A steady ratcheting down of the maximum allowed
HERS index for new construction allows home builders and their subcontractors the time to retrain and modernize their design practices to meet performance targets without major shocks to
the price of construction.
GHG impact: Estimated at 1.6 percent of statewide GHG emissions in 2020, based on an average reduction of over 50 percent in the energy use of new code-built buildings in 2020 versus
2008, and improved levels of energy code compliance.
Other benefits: A stronger emphasis on energy use requires earlier attention to building design
and performance considerations than is currently practiced. This generally is the most cost-effective time to find cost savings, and results in the use of more skilled labor early in a project, while
reducing energy and material costs later during construction and occupancy. Further, more
energy efficient buildings can better manage air quality and moisture in a building through controlled ventilation. Energy modeling forces consideration of benefits such as daylighting that improve health, productivity and quality of life for building occupants. Added thermal insulation both
reduces drafts and improves sound insulation, and mechanical ventilation reduces dust and mold
build-up in homes.
Costs: On average, up-front design and construction costs are likely to increase marginally. To
date, cost estimates have been in the 1 percent to 3 percent range for both residential and commercial buildings that achieve a 20 percent to 30 percent improvement over the base code. In

21

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

return for this upfront investment the developer is able to more clearly differentiate new construction as higher-performance than the stock of existing buildings, and the final owner/operator
of the building receives significant energy cost savings.
Equity issues: Inability to afford heating fuel is widespread in Massachusetts, and the cost of
subsidizing fuel needs of low-income households is borne broadly by ratepayers as a result.
Higher-efficiency homes are a direct and sustainable method of addressing this social issue. More
efficient homes reduce the cost of homeownership, they directly benefit renters who pay the cost
of utilities, and indirectly benefit them when utilities are included in rents. For commercial buildings improved codes reduce the cost of doing business for retail and commercial office tenants,
and operating costs fall for all investors in new commercial real estate.
Experience in other states: California is the first state to propose a roadmap to zero-net
energy homes and commercial buildings, and their approach has several similarities to that proposed in Massachusetts. However, as our climates are somewhat different the specific measures
and building designs differ, particularly given our heating-load dominated residential market. The
commercial building sector initiatives in New York City, California, and Washington D.C. show
broad support for improvement in building energy performance.
Legal authority: The building energy code is governed by the independent Board of Building
Regulation and Standards (BBRS). The Department of Public Safety (DPS), EEA and DOER will
continue working together to craft future energy code provisions for consideration by the BBRS.
The Commonwealth could also pass legislation to clarify the scope29 and direction of the building
energy code and to provide longer-term certainty for the real estate marketplace.
Implementation issues: The residential sector has begun the market-led transition to performance-based energy codes remarkably smoothly. However, as the rest of the market follows and
as energy code requirements increase, the need for training and technical assistance is likely to
rise. In order to ensure and improve code compliance, ongoing resources will be needed to provide continued training in best practices to builders, designers and subcontractors working in the
new construction and retrofit markets.
The commercial sector is perhaps earlier in the transition to high performance buildings, but the
professionalization of design and engineering teams is higher. In order to effectively transition to
performance-based codes for commercial buildings improvements and standardization in energy
modeling will be needed, and there will be increased demand for building energy modelers. These
are new clean energy jobs that require 21st century skill sets, and Massachusetts will only retain
its leadership in green building design and engineering by cultivating this workforce.
Uncertainty: With the baseline energy codes in Massachusetts now tied to decisions of the
International Code Council (ICC) there is a delegation of authority to this national body. The
policy described here would reduce the uncertainty inherent in relying on the ICC by laying out a
codes road map for the next three code cycles from 2012 through 2018. The impact of these
codes on overall GHG emissions depends greatly on the economic performance of the broader
economy and the resulting level of investment in new construction and building renovation.

29

The mandate of the BBRS is presently limited in regard to areas such as water conservation, siting, and other ―green‖
building considerations that impact energy use and that are addressed in recent ―green‖ codes from ASHRAE and the ICC.

New Policy
BUILDING ENERGY RATING AND LABELING
Policy summary: The current real estate market operates without the explicit consideration of
energy performance of the property – a significant factor in future operating costs. Potential
building owners or tenants of either residential or commercial buildings make major investments
without the ability to compare the energy performance of the buildings they are interested in.
This policy would address this market barrier by introducing an energy rating program designed
to facilitate ―apples-to-apples‖ comparisons between buildings. Initially in a pilot form, this would
be the buildings equivalent of the EPA MPG rating on cars and light trucks. This policy
complements existing efforts to track actual energy use through utility billing data, but the
ratings are intended to be independent of tenant or user behavior, and are known as ―asset‖
ratings. The DOER is developing pilot programs for new ―asset ratings‖ of both residential and
commercial buildings.
Clean energy economy impacts: Building energy labeling is anticipated to enable significant
additional investments in energy efficiency. This investment in turn leads to large reductions in
fuel expenses and creates and supports clean energy jobs in residential and commercial
remodeling and construction. Less spending on imported fuel will keep more money in the state
economy and thereby create additional jobs.
Rationale: At present the voluntary market is providing a glimpse of the potential for an ―MPG
rating‖ for buildings. For commercial buildings the Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) green building rating has become a must-have requirement for class-A office
space in cities across the country, including the greater Boston area. But while the LEED program
has steadily improved its emphasis on energy costs, it remains a poor proxy for energy savings
potential, and instead signifies that the building underwent a more thoughtful design process
than is typical elsewhere in the market. In addition, a growing number of relatively energy
efficient buildings have opted into the Energy Star Portfolio Manager program for commercial
buildings — which allows buildings above the 75th percentile in energy performance to receive an
Energy Star designation.
For the residential market a similar story is apparent. The Energy Star homes program has
achieved significant market penetration in MA and other states around the country, and LEED for
homes is also a growing ―green building‖ presence, alongside several other green homes
certification programs.
While these voluntary programs have shown that there is market interest in energy and green
design data, their impact has been limited largely to new construction, particularly toward the
higher end of the market, leaving existing residential and commercial real estate markets largely
unaffected. Initially developed as pilot programs serving the much larger existing buildings
market, this policy could become a standardized source of energy comparison information. This
would enable investment decisions that improve energy performance once developers are able to
demonstrate and market the results of their investment.
Design issues: Any energy benchmarking and rating metric needs to be clear, transparent and
trusted if it is to support increased energy efficiency investment. However, residential and
commercial real estate markets face different design issues. For the relatively homogenous

23

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

residential market, a comparison of total annual energy needs (primarily heating and
standardized electric plug loads) is likely to be the most intuitive metric. DOER, in collaboration
with three other states and funding from the DOE, is launching a pilot along these lines in
western Massachusetts in 2011.
For the more diverse commercial real estate market, an accurate comparison of energy needs per
square foot (primarily heating, cooling, ventilation and lighting in office/retail/lab spaces) is the
generally accepted metric. DOER in collaboration with a public and private sector team is
developing a pilot to launch in eastern Massachusetts.
GHG impact: The GHG impact for this policy is indirect, in that it enables larger and more
targeted energy efficiency investments in the covered real estate markets. It is too early to
estimate the actual level of GHG savings attributable to this policy. However, given the large
number of existing buildings and the equally large level of annual investment made in building
renovations, retrofits and other improvements, enabling the market valuation of energy
performance has the potential to foster significant private investment in energy-saving measures
and hence reduced carbon emissions. Two major constraints to energy efficiency investment are
lack of awareness of potential savings, and lack of credible metrics to support financing from
lenders. This policy tackles both of these market failures, and enables smarter real-estate
investment decisions.
Other benefits: The task of rating and labeling building energy performance is a labor intensive
and skilled exercise. The resulting clean energy jobs are paid for from the energy savings and the
other actionable building condition information that results from the building assessments. Energy
assessments conducted for asset ratings generally uncover operational issues that can affect
building durability (such as water damage, mold, and mechanical problems) as well as more
energy-specific improvement opportunities. This information on buildings results in better market
valuation and reduced investor risk, and also facilitates improved comfort and early identification
of any health and life-safety issues.
Costs: The primary costs of energy asset rating and labeling programs is in the initial building
assessments. It is critically important that these assessments are conducted in an independent,
consistent and professional manner to ensure the integrity of the ratings. At the same time it is
important to minimize costs to building owners and property managers. The Commonwealth is
moving forward with pilot programs for both residential and commercial building energy rating to
better assess the likely costs of implementation and to allow for both technology and process
innovations to be tested, to reduce costs prior to any broader statewide deployment.
Equity issues: Providing access to energy use comparison data is likely to have equity benefits
for low and moderate income households for whom energy costs represent a significant portion of
their disposable income. As a result, there has been relatively high voluntary adoption of the
Energy Star homes program by public and affordable housing programs both in Massachusetts
and elsewhere in the U.S. Similarly, for the commercial buildings sector it is likely that small
business owners and tenants who lease space will be the primary beneficiaries of more
transparent and comprehensive access to energy comparison data in making decisions about
where to lease and buy commercial space.
Experience in other states: Residential energy labeling has been successfully piloted in
various metro-areas in the U.S., and has become a cornerstone of the European Union climate

24

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

and energy policy framework for buildings. Notable examples in the U.S. on the residential side
include Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and Austin, Texas. On the commercial side
California is moving to a mandatory utility bill disclosure and benchmarking program through
Energy Star Portfolio Manager. Similar programs are underway in New York City and Washington
D.C. for public sector buildings and commercial office markets. A growing number of property
management companies are developing internal metrics to assess building energy assets and
performance in order to inform investment decisions across their portfolio. Adopting an ―asset‖
rating, which has credibility for building appraisers in commercial real estate, is a new idea in the
U.S., although it has been the policy direction of the European Union for the past several years.
Legal authority: The Commonwealth can likely require energy ratings as part of the building
code governed by the independent Board of Building Regulation and Standards (BBRS). Based on
the findings of the pilots, DOER and the Department of Public Safety will develop plans for
widespread adoption of rating and labeling and their possible incorporation into the building code.
However, the state may opt to put such a requirement in legislation in order to provide longerterm certainty for investors and businesses in the real estate marketplace.
Implementation issues: If energy labeling pilot programs are subsequently expanded to a
statewide level, the large number of existing buildings to assess and rate mean that it will
necessarily take many years to fully implement this policy. As a result, the timing of market
coverage will likely vary in different market segments and different geographic areas around the
state. Further, in order to be effective energy ratings need to be accessible prior to any major
financial transactions, and ensuring awareness and access to this information may be initially
difficult while market coverage is low.
Uncertainty: The rate of adoption of energy ratings and labels by different segments of the real
estate market, and the impact that this new information will have on efficiency investment
decisions, is unknown. A certain threshold level or ―critical mass‖ is needed for both the
residential and commercial markets to make full use of energy comparison data in their
purchasing and leasing decisions, and it will likely take a few years before a broader trend in
energy efficiency investments can be seen in response to these market signals. Availability of
sufficient financing to improve properties is also likely dependent on broader economic trends.

―DEEP‖ ENERGY EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS FOR BUILDINGS
Policy summary: To reach our 2050 GHG reduction requirement, energy use in existing
buildings must fall dramatically. To accomplish this, it is necessary to begin retrofitting buildings
with much higher levels of insulation, less air leakage, and better windows than are typically
installed in the retrofit energy efficiency programs. This policy would make rebates and
appropriate training and technical support widely available for ―deeper‖ energy improvements for
residential buildings
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020

0.1 - 0.2 million metric tons; 0.1%-0.2%

Total Fuel Savings in 2020 (MMBtu)

2.7 million

Total Electricity Savings in 2020 (MWh)

79,000

Energy cost savings in 2020

$84 million

Note: energy savings are for the “high” case, with 0.2 million metric tons of CO 2 reductions.

Clean energy economy impacts: Deep retrofits will save large amounts of both electricity and
heating fuels, reducing living costs and cutting energy imports; while expanding job opportunities
for skilled contractors and construction workers.
Rationale: At present the energy efficiency program administrator (PA)-operated programs
provide financial incentives for ―moderate‖ retrofits of residential buildings, such as adding
insulation to attics and walls, upgrading fossil-fuel-based heating and cooling equipment, and air
sealing. If all the standard measures are done, these improvements typically achieve 20 percent
to 30 percent reductions in heating energy use. While a major contributor to our 2020 emissions
target, this level of savings is far from adequate for achieving the 2050 requirement of an 80
percent emissions reduction. For 2050 ―deeper‖ measures are needed –higher and more
consistent levels of insulation on all the outside surfaces of a building, along with sharp
reductions in air leakage. When needed building maintenance is done without adding insulation,
such as re-roofing and re-siding, there is a huge ―lost opportunity‖ for achieving energy savings.
The PAs currently have pilots that provide incentives for such deep retrofits. This policy would
make such incentives a standard part of the PA offerings, with the expectation that their adoption
by consumers would gradually rise from now through 2020.
Design issues: Until recently the utilities’ pilot only provided incentives for whole-house deep
retrofits. The cost of such retrofits is quite high, for both the homeowner and the utilities, and is
unlikely to be done broadly. More attractive to homeowners may be ―partial‖ deep retrofits,
where one part of a house is done at a time when the owner was planning to do a renovation
anyway. The incremental cost of energy saving improvements is greatly reduced when they are
integrated with other work on the same portion of a home, such as when replacing a roof,
residing exterior walls, or replacing windows. This policy would provide rebates that are
substantial enough to attract widespread adoption of deep retrofits, such as rigid insulation
installed below the roofing shingles or inside new siding, and triple-pane windows.
Another design option is to continue what some PA deep retrofit pilots are doing currently, paying
higher incentives for comprehensive projects that go deeper still, to Net Zero Energy, Passive
House and Thousand Homes Challenge levels. Once heating needs are reduced to this level, there
are significant savings on heating and cooling equipment. This practice provides additional

26

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

leveraging and measure bundling advantages, and builds the skills needed to reach the 2050
GHG reduction requirement.
In addition, the particular methods that are used to evaluate programs for cost effectiveness should
be reviewed to ensure that deep retrofits can be implemented to the maximum possible extent.
GHG impact: 0.1 to 0.2 million tons in 2020, depending on the rate of adoption by consumers.
The state’s consultants have projected a relatively small number of project completions, based on
(a) homeowners only undertake deep retrofits at the time when they are doing building
maintenance anyway, (b) consumer adoption begins at low levels and grows slowly until it
reaches 10 percent of normal maintenance projects by 2020. Since these are long-lasting
improvements to buildings the cumulative impacts continue growing beyond 2020, contributing
substantially to the 2050 reduction requirement.
Other benefits: Substantial reductions in energy use, cost savings to homeowner, and
improvements to building comfort.
Costs: Costs to the utility efficiency budgets and to homeowners are significant. For an
expanded program that goes beyond the current pilots, impacts on utility budgets would depend
on the scale of adoption by consumers.
Equity issues: In most cases the incentives for deep retrofits will be substantially larger than
those offered for ―moderate‖ retrofits. This creates possible equity issues between participants
and non-participants in the program.
Experience in other states: The pilots currently underway by Massachusetts utilities are at the
forefront of deep retrofit efforts in the United States. California has made a commitment to
achieving sharp reductions in energy use by existing buildings, and the Province of Yukon in
Canada has a program to super-insulate existing buildings.
Legal authority: These kinds of programs fall within the authority of the electric and gas
utilities under their existing efficiency programs.
Implementation issues: Deep retrofits involve more complex construction techniques than are
needed for conventional construction or moderate retrofits. To achieve the projected energy
savings, and to not create or worsen other problems such as moisture and mold issues in a home,
the deep retrofit shell must be installed correctly. As less heat is used in a building the drying
potential is greatly reduced, so both interior and exterior water management details become critical
for the health of occupants and durability of the structure. To avoid other indoor air quality
problems, as well as to capitalize on smaller heating loads, shell measures should be carefully
integrated with mechanical ventilation and smaller heating equipment that has sealed combustion
or forced draft. Further, deep measures, if installed incrementally, should be deployed in a manner
that does not hamper future energy improvements. This requires contractors with appropriate deep
retrofit expertise, partnered with others with advanced HVAC expertise. At present these
skills\teams are in limited supply and there is a need for training of contractors, along with a
contractor guidance and inspection component such as in the Energy Star Homes program. Also
needed is a system or incentives for a party involved to have long-term responsibility for the
energy performance, durability, health, and safety of buildings that undergo deep retrofits.
Uncertainty: The rate of adoption of deep retrofits by consumers, even with substantial utility
incentives, is not known and could be lower than projected. Availability of sufficient funds, from
utility budgets or other sources, could be a question if the rate of adoption is high.

New Policy
EXPANDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS TO COMMERCIAL/ INDUSTRIAL
HEATING OIL
Policy summary: At present the electric utilities provide funding for heating-related efficiency
measures in homes that use oil heat. There is no funding available for commercial and industrial
buildings that use fuel oil for heating. Expanding the programs to such customers would yield
significant cuts in energy use and GHG emissions.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020

0.1 million metric tons; 0.1%

MMBTU oil savings in 2020

230,000

Clean energy economy impacts: These programs would result in increased employment in
efficiency audits and installation of efficiency measures and reduced spending on fuel oil imports,
which keeps more money in the state and thereby helps to provide jobs throughout the
Commonwealth’s economy. Companies using fuel oil would see lower operating costs, which
increase their ability to continue operating in Massachusetts.
Rationale: The exclusion of commercial and industrial (C/I) customers from oil heating
efficiency programs is a significant missed opportunity for reducing energy use and GHG
emissions. Given that heating oil is a relatively high-carbon fuel, and that the lack of programs in
the past means that such buildings will typically have low efficiency levels, the savings both in
energy and GHG should be relatively high per dollar of funds spent.
Design issues: At present there may not be legal authorization for the electric utilities to
provide funding to C/I customers in the same way that they do for residential customers. If this is
the case then other funding sources will be needed, such as RGGI funds.
GHG impact: Assuming that C/I customers participate at the same rate, relative to their total
use of heating oil, as do residential customers at present and as projected for the future, we
estimate savings of 0.1 million metric tons of CO2 in 2020.
Other benefits: Non-CO2 air pollutants from fuel oil will be reduced due to lower consumption,
including reductions in SO2, NOx, and particulates.
Costs: Relatively small since C/I customers constitute only about one-quarter of total heating oil
consumption in Massachusetts, with the rest being residential.
Equity issues: Heating oil customers do not pay into a specific efficiency funding pool, as do
electricity and natural gas customers. However, in almost all cases they are also electricity
ratepayers, and as with residential customers, if there are highly cost-effective efficiency
opportunities available for heating-related measures, it can be argued that this is a good use of
utility-administered efficiency funds. If other funding sources are used, equity considerations will
depend on the source.
Legal authority: Needs further investigation, depending on anticipated sources of funds.
Uncertainty: Measures to improve the efficiency of building shells, heating systems, and
heating distribution systems are well known and there is extensive experience with them, so
there is little risk of not being able to achieve cost-effective energy and GHG savings.

New Policy
DEVELOPING A MATURE MARKET FOR SOLAR THERMAL WATER AND SPACE
HEATING
Policy summary: A policy framework will be established to achieve a mature and selfsustaining market for solar thermal water and space heating in both residential and commercial
buildings. This support for the nascent solar thermal market is part of a broader goal of
developing renewable heating technologies (such as clean biomass heating and efficient heat
pumps), to facilitate a market transition to renewable fuels as the dominant fuels for heating
purposes by 2050. The policy will also establish robust job and business growth in the renewable
thermal sector in the Commonwealth.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020

0.1 million metric tons; 0.1%

Clean energy economy impacts: Large reductions in fuel costs in exchange for investments in
solar thermal heating equipment will reduce the cost of living for residents and the cost of
business for commercial customers. New installations will result in the growth of the solar
thermal industry in Massachusetts, and to a lesser extent, local maintenance work. Directly
offsetting spending on imported fuel will keep more money in the region and thereby create
additional jobs in the broader state economy.
Rationale: Hot water and space heating are large energy users that do not require very highgrade fuels (unlike motor vehicles for example). This makes them excellent candidates for active
solar heating, which has no fuel expense and can provide significant heating from a small roof,
wall or ground-mounted system. Unlike in the 1970’s, the technology for active solar thermal
heating is now mature and comes with decade-long warrantees to protect the up-front
investment in a solar thermal system. However, the market for solar thermal in New England is
currently very small, and needs ‖infant industry‖ support to accelerate its growth to the scale
needed to maintain continued growth and provide a realistic option to interested customers.
Design issues: Similar to the Solar PV industry in MA prior to its recent exponential growth in
the last four years, the small size of the solar thermal market burdens it with high levels of ‖soft‖
costs in sales and marketing (finding customers and designing and installing well-sized systems).
This forms a barrier to consumer awareness and competitive pricing in comparison to the
dominant market share of fossil fuel-based heating systems. The ‖hard‖ costs of quality
equipment are being driven down by global market growth, and so once Massachusetts can
develop a significant demand entrepreneurial companies will likely be able to bring turn-key
pricing down considerably. Solar thermal systems require a back-up system in the event of a cold
and cloudy week in winter, so most customers will retain their pre-existing fossil fuel heating
system and new construction will likely move to on-demand electric or much smaller backup
fossil fueled boilers .
GHG impact: For purposes of this Plan, a modest 0.1 million ton reduction in emissions due to
solar thermal is forecast. However, larger reductions could be attained through a broader
program applying to all renewable thermal technologies, including heat-pumps, biomass/biofuels,
and solar thermal. If the displacement of 20 percent of the fuel oil used for thermal energy and
50 percent of propane heating and electric water heating could be attained, this would reduce
GHG emissions in Massachusetts by approximately 2 million tons, or slightly more than 2 percent

29

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

of total 1990 emissions. This 2020 goal would be for all renewable thermal technologies,
including heat-pumps, biomass/biofuels, and solar thermal applications. GHG emissions from
biomass and biofuels used for thermal energy are important to consider, but Massachusetts
policies will limit the eligibility of feedstocks (advanced biofuels and residue woody biomass) to
those which demonstrate real and rapid GHG benefits, such as advanced biofuels and residue
woody biomass
Other benefits: Expanding solar thermal energy will create and expand businesses in
Massachusetts in a manner similar to our early stimulation of the solar PV market. For solar PV,
the Commonwealth has added 1,800 new jobs since 2008 when the solar PV programs were
launched. PV installations grew from 3 MW to 35 MW between 2007 and 2010, with another 35
MW in the development pipeline. Jobs will include system marketing, design, finance, installation
and maintenance, along with manufacturing and fabrication of solar thermal panels and system
components. In addition a mature solar thermal market complements the utility energy efficiency
and advanced building energy codes policies. For existing homes in particular, there is a large
stock of buildings that are heated with hot water, and where solar exposure is available these
distribution systems can be easily retrofitted to provide space heating from renewable solar
heated water with the fossil fuel systems retained as back-up systems.
Costs: In order to accelerate the market for solar thermal systems a highly publicized state
rebate program analogous to the successful Commonwealth Solar program for PV is
recommended. Due to the lower per system costs of solar thermal the MassCEC has proposed
launching a pilot program to explore the most effective way to implement such a program. Any
state rebate would leverage existing incentives primarily from Federal tax credits and the utility
managed zero-interest HEAT loan program.
Equity issues: As with any upfront capital intensive investment, the early adopters of solar
thermal systems are often relatively affluent homeowners, large well capitalized businesses, and
the public sector, that have the resources to take advantage of the long term benefits of
renewable heating both for their bottom-line and co-benefits. However, these early actors
catalyze the market, provide useful exposure and marketing, and bring down costs, all of which
makes these technologies increasingly accessible and desirable to the broader market. Among the
early adopters of solar PV in Massachusetts was the public housing and affordable housing sector,
with a notable role played by Boston Community Capital.
Experience in other states: Solar thermal subsidies to support the industry are relatively
widespread and have grown in use in U.S. states including: New Hampshire, California,
Delaware, Wisconsin, New Jersey, and Arizona. Total state incentives typically account for 25
percent to 50 percent of the system installed cost, but are expected to fall substantially over
time. In particular, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Washington D.C. have added solar
thermal to the ―solar carve-out‖ of their Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) programs, which are
primarily designed to support electric renewable energy sources. Massachusetts would also have
this option once a pilot rebate period runs its course.
Legal authority: In order to add an incentive for solar thermal to the Massachusetts RPS
regulations, new legislation would be required. In the absence of this, the Clean Energy Center is
able to provide rebate funding and other incentives to thermal renewables as part of their
enabling mandate in the Green Communities Act of 2008.

30

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Implementation issues: The perceived barriers to solar thermal adoption can be summarized
in the following four areas:
1. Upfront cost of system
2. Lack of consumer education and confidence
3. Shortage of experienced solar hot water designers
4. Permitting costs and inspections
All of these can be addressed in a well designed pilot, followed by a broader program.
Uncertainty: Projections of the rate of adoption of solar thermal systems in response to a well
designed solar thermal incentive program are highly uncertain. The precise rate at which rebates
or other incentives would be taken up by the private market is also unknown. However, the
lessons of the Commonwealth Solar Rebate program for PV and the experiences of other states
are instructive. As with any alternative to fossil fuels, the volatility in the price of oil and to a
lesser extent the price of natural gas over the coming decade is a critical uncertainty.

New Policy
TREE RETENTION AND PLANTING TO REDUCE HEATING AND COOLING LOADS
Policy summary: Trees help to reduce heating and cooling loads in buildings. This policy would
provide incentives to plant new trees around existing housing, and retain trees within new
housing developments, to conserve energy and reduce GHG emissions. This pilot program might
be feasible within current utility efficiency programs, or might require new funding and/or
regulatory authority.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in
2020

100,000 metric tons in 2020, 300,000 tons in
2035 from trees planted by 2020

Clean energy economy impacts: On the order of 500 direct jobs per year from the scale of
tree planting envisioned here, in nurseries, planting, and maintenance. Reduced energy costs and
lower fuel imports.
Rationale: Strategically located around housing, trees can significantly reduce cooling and
heating loads.30 Retaining trees when new homes are built, and planting new ones around
existing housing, can be a low-cost means of saving energy and reducing GHG emissions.
Optimally trees should be located on the southeast and southwest sides of a building to provide
shade and reduce air conditioning load. Evergreen trees planted on the north and northwest sides
(given prevailing winds in Massachusetts) provide wind breaks and can reduce winter heating
needs. Retaining and planting trees could be subsidized by the electric and gas utilities on the
same basis that they provide incentives for other efficiency measures.
Design issues: For existing residential buildings, incentives could be provided to owners to
plant new trees in the correct locations. For new housing development, incentives could be
provided to developers to retain existing tree cover, and to particularly keep trees in the optimal
locations for cooling and heating savings. Another option would be to provide incentives to
municipal governments that pass local planning ordinances requiring developers to follow specific
tree retention practices. Because trees generally take 15 years to reach their full shade potential,
this policy would need to begin soon to have much impact by 2020. On the other hand, even if
impacts by 2020 are small, they will rise after 2020 as trees mature, contributing to the 2050
GHG requirement.

30

Studies of large scale tree-planting programs in New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia resulted in a 1.7C average
reduction in maximum air temperature in the hottest areas. Chicago heat island reduction measures reduced annual
cooling degree days by 39. ―Energy Savings for Heat-Island Reduction Strategies in Chicago and Houston (including
updates for Baton Rouge, Sacramento, and Salt Lake City,” S. Konopacki and H. Akbari, 2002, Lawrence Berkeley

through evapotranspiration. Per-tree calculation: a single white spruce with dbh 8inches is projected to save 1.1MBTU in
heating energy for a single family home in Boston. (Casey Trees, based on the USFS iTree model). Toronto area heat
energy savings: single family residences saved 3 percent (built pre-1980) and 2.5 percent (after 1980); efficient R-2000
houses 2 percent; row-houses 1.6 percent (built before 1980) and 1 percent (built after 1980) (Konopacki and Akbari,
2002).

32

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

GHG impact: About 100,000 metric tons CO2e potential by 2020 under realistic assumptions of
possible participation. Savings become much greater over time, rising to 300,000 tons in 2035
from the trees planted/retained by 2020, because most will not have reached their full growth
until well past 2020. (Note that GHG savings from trees sequestering CO 2 are real but are not
included here. Due to data problems, tree sequestration is not included in the 1990 baseline
emissions estimate, nor are reductions or increases in sequestration in the years since then
included. Without those numbers it is not valid to include sequestration gains due to a policy
measure.)
Other benefits: Trees significantly improve the quality of life for immediate residents and the
neighborhoods around them. This may have other secondary benefits which have not been
quantified — such as higher real estate values, better-maintained homes, lower crime, etc.
Costs: Depending on the scale and scope of these programs, their costs could vary greatly. More
than most efficiency programs, the benefits accrue over a long time period. Pilot programs
between state agencies and utilities will allow for analysis of cost and benefits, as well as
identifying implementation issues. One current estimate is on the order of $150 per tree for
purchase and planting.
Equity issues: To fairly distribute benefits to urban and lower-income residents, it would be
essential to ensure that the tree planting take place on a large scale in cities as well as around
suburban homes, despite the likelihood of greater siting difficulties. As with the existing efficiency
programs, this could be a particular challenge for rental housing, where landlords often lack the
incentive to cut energy costs when tenants are paying the electricity and/or heating bills. Greater
efforts would need to be made to achieve participation in rental properties.
Experience in other states: Utility-funded tree-planting programs are already in place in
several cities and states. Sacramento, CA has avoided the cost of constructing a new 19 MW
power plant by planting over 450,000 trees next to homes. With funding from the Sacramento
Municipal Utility District (SMUD), the Sacramento Shade (for residences) and Neighbor Woods
(for public spaces) Programs aim to plant 5 million trees by 2025. Residents are eligible for up to
10 free trees. SMUD estimates that each tree provides $90 in annual benefit. 31 In Iowa, the
Municipal Tree Planting Program is a partnership between the non-profit Trees Forever and four
utilities, in which the utilities provide funding for community planting programs. 32 Here in
Massachusetts, Grow Boston Greener is a collaborative effort of the City of Boston and its
partners in Boston’s Urban Forest Coalition to increase the urban tree canopy cover in the city by
planting 100,000 trees by 2020.

31 The partnership between the Sacramento Municipal Utility District and Sacramento Tree Foundation has been ongoing
since 1990. http://www.smud.org/en/residential/trees/Pages/index.aspx or http://www.sactree.com/doc.aspx?25 .
Riverside, California program: http://www.riversideca.gov/UTILITIES/resi-treepower.asp. Pasadena, Alameda, and a
number of other California utility companies have similar programs. Initiatives to capture environmental savings from
trees are also underway in more temperate climates. The Department of Public Services in Portland, Maine will deliver and
plant trees that residents purchase at local nurseries. The ―Treebate‖ program in Portland, Oregon offers residents a
rebate on trees they purchase and plant (funded for water quality). Washington, DC residents can receive a $50 rebate
for each eligible species of tree.

33

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Legal authority: PAs have the authority to conduct pilots and to expand these into new
efficiency programs, based on approval of the Energy Efficiency Advisory Council and the DPU.
Pilots will help determine whether and over what time period energy savings exceed costs. The
results of such pilot programs will help determine the value and feasibility of tree planting and
retention activities.
Implementation issues: This would be a pioneering program in the northeast, and so a variety
of program approaches to achieving participation, planting trees effectively, and maintaining
them could occur.
Uncertainty: We do not know the degree to which residents will be willing to participate, even
with subsidies; nor the degree to which developers and landlords will participate; nor
municipalities for a program design in which they require developers to retain trees.

FEDERAL APPLIANCE AND PRODUCT STANDARDS
Policy summary: The federal government sets energy efficiency standards for appliances,
electronics, and other products. Under President Obama, DOE has planned an accelerated
schedule for setting new standards between 2009 and 2013. Nationwide these are expected to
yield major savings in electricity (11.5 percent of total consumption in 2020), fuel, costs to
homeowners and businesses, and carbon dioxide emissions, with Massachusetts getting its
proportional share.33
Savings (above current trends)34

Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

$330 million

Cumulative net benefits 2011-2020 (discounted)

$2.7 billion

Jobs gained 2020 (direct and indirect)

1,200 jobs

Clean energy economy impacts: Reduction of $330 million in costs in 2020 will improve cost
of living for residents and reduce operating costs for businesses, also helping to keep jobs in the
state.
Rationale: As with most efficiency measures, appliance and product efficiency faces market
barriers that result in consumers making short-term purchasing decisions that don’t reflect the
optimal financial decisions long-term. To some degree this occurs because products, particularly
appliances, are often bought on an emergency basis when the old item has failed. By mandating
that products be built to specifications that will minimize their lifecycle costs, including both
capital and energy costs, DOE can drive large savings.
Policy design and issues: The federal government sets nationwide standards, in some cases,
due because climate conditions standards vary by region (such as with windows), but in other
cases DOE has not made this distinction, as with heating system efficiencies. For this reason,
Massachusetts applied for a federal waiver to set a standard for gas furnaces higher than the 80
percent federal standard, due to our colder climate. DOE denied Massachusetts’ waiver request;
although it has said that it is looking to develop a higher standard for the entire northern tier of
the country.

34

Because federal standards have existed in the past and exist today, the state’s consultants estimate that half the
savings from forthcoming standards are already embedded in the ―business as usual‖ trend lines; so only half the savings
expected from the planned federal standards are included here. Also, the savings given here for 2020 include a portion of
savings over the lifetime of products purchased by 2020, some of which occur after 2020.
35

―State-Level Benefits from Potential Federal Appliance Standards,‖ Appliance Standards Awareness Project, 2009.

35

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

GHG impact: ACEEE and the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) forecast that the
forthcoming standards will reduce GHG emissions by 1.0 million tons in 2020. The
Commonwealth’s consultants estimate that half of these reductions are already counted in the
business-as-usual (BAU) trend for electricity emissions in 2020, and so 0.5 million tons are
counted as a reduction versus the BAU.
Other benefits: The standards yield large savings in electricity and costs. In parallel with the
GHG reductions, half of the savings are counted in the existing trends, so the incremental gains
are estimated at 1,040 gigawatt hours of electricity and $200 million in 2020.
Costs: Incremental costs of production vary for each product, and are required to be less than
the lifetime energy savings in each case in order for DOE to set a standard. Sample costs are $52
for a refrigerator, $50 for a clothes dryer, and $2 for microwave ovens. There have been reports
of more frequent or more expensive repairs needed for some items, such as the computer boards
for variable speed motors in refrigerators.
Equity issues: Not significant, due to low incremental cost of attaining higher efficiency
standards.
Experience in other states: This is a nationwide program.
Legal authority: The federal government has preempted authority over efficiency standards for
products; states can apply for waivers.
Implementation issues: None known.
Uncertainty: Energy savings per product are dependable due to mass production and quality
standards. Durability of products can be an issue, and higher frequency of replacements would
reduce energy savings due to the embodied energy in manufacturing of products.

investments are best suited for research and
development and early-stage companies or
projects. A Renewable Energy Portfolio
Standard can create market demand for all
qualifying technologies, while specific
requirements for particular technologies can
target support for emerging technologies. By
setting a price for carbon dioxide emissions
from power plants by auction, the Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) provides
the power generating market with a
transparent, stable, technology-neutral
signal that influences both new investments
and current operations. And implementation
of Federal Clean Air Act rules encourages
generators to retire or upgrade their dirtiest
plants.

Electricity Supply
The vast majority of existing power plants
burn fossil fuels to generate electricity,
producing millions of tons of pollution.
Additional electricity generation technologies
include nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, and
eligible biomass, which vary in their
emissions profiles. The character of the
electric power sector as a whole is
determined by three key factors: the
demand for electricity across sectors,
existing generation capacity by technology
type, and actual generation, which depends
on how much of each type of existing
capacity is utilized to meet demand. There
are several approaches related to each of
these factors that can push the
Commonwealth toward a clean energy future
for electricity supply.

In order to achieve the GHG emission limit
set by the Secretary, the Massachusetts
Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
relies on progress in each of these areas
made since 2007, along with proposed new
measures to move toward a cleaner
electricity supply.

Massachusetts Clean Energy Center
The Green Jobs Act of 2008 created the
MassCEC to accelerate job growth and
economic development in the state’s clean
energy industry. MassCEC serves as a
clearinghouse and support center for the
clean energy sector, making direct
investments in new and existing
technologies, clean energy companies, and
workforce development to meet the skill
needs of this growing industry.

Demand for electricity can be reduced by
improving the energy efficiency of our enduse devices, such as refrigerators and office
equipment, as is discussed in the buildings
section of this Plan. Both generating capacity
and actual generation of clean energy
technologies can be increased by a spectrum
of activities based on the maturity of the
technology.36 Grants and other direct

In November 2009, an Act Relative to Clean
Energy transferred the state's Renewable
Energy Trust Fund to MassCEC. The Trust
Fund was created in 1998 by the Legislature
to provide financial assistance for
development of renewable energy projects.
With funds and programs to support clean
energy development, entrepreneurship,

are only eligible for the RPS if they yield true
and substantial GHG reductions.
The Green Communities Act of 2008 (GCA)
also made several other changes to further
drive investment in the renewable energy
market enabled by the RPS. It requires that
the electric distribution companies solicit bids
for long-term contracts of 10 to 15 years
from new renewable energy projects. Lack of
such a long-term power purchase agreement
is often a stumbling block for renewable
energy projects to obtain financing. In
addition, operators of distributed renewable
electricity generation such as rooftop solar
panels and community wind turbines are now
eligible to sell excess electricity back into the
grid at the price they pay (known as ―netmetering‖), effectively having their electric
meters turn backwards. Finally, distribution
utilities were granted authority to each build
and own up to 50 megawatts (MW) of solar
generation. There are 11 MW underway or
completed thus far.

Renewable Portfolio Standard
The RPS is used in more than 20 states and
in other countries to create demand for
renewable energy technologies such as wind,
solar, biomass, and small hydro that are not
yet price competitive with conventional
power sources.37 In Massachusetts, retail
sellers of electricity are required to obtain a
growing share of their supply from new
renewable sources, thereby creating a
demand for new projects. The eligible
renewable resources are categorized into
―classes‖ of similar maturity and type
(―technology banding‖). For example, wind,
eligible biomass and anaerobic digestion, and
small hydro are all in Class I while solar is
carved out into a separate class. Beginning
in 2003, the share of total electricity supply
required to come from Class I resources
increased one-half percent a year, reaching 4
percent in 2009. Starting in 2010, the
required percentage increased by 1 percent a
year, and will rise to 15 percent by 2020.

Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative
(RGGI)
Massachusetts is one of 10 states
participating in the RGGI. The initiative,
which began in January 2009, establishes a
region-wide constraint on CO2 emissions
from fossil fuel-fired power plants. The
current program design calls for the cap to
remain at the initial level for six years (2009
to 2014), and then to decrease by 2.5
percent per year for the next four years, for
a total reduction of 10 percent by 2018.
RGGI provides a transparent and stable
signal to the electricity market to plan future
investments with an understanding that
higher emitting generators will need a
greater number of emissions allowances than
cleaner generators. Proceeds from the
auction of allowances have been effectively
used to fund a range of energy efficiency
programs in the state, resulting in cost

In addition to requiring increasing amounts
of renewables in the market, the Department
of Energy Resources (DOER) has taken steps
to assure that the kind of renewables that
receive state incentives produce GHG
savings over time. In 2009, DOER
commissioned a study from the Manomet
Center for Conservation Sciences to explore
the lifecycle GHG implications of biomass
energy plants. The results of the study,
published in 2010, questioned long-held
assumptions about the carbon-neutrality of
biomass electricity technologies, and DOER is
currently in the midst of finalizing RPS
regulations to assure that biomass projects

savings for residential and business
consumers.

From 2005 to 2009, the electricity portfolio
serving Massachusetts became more than 20
percent cleaner. This was largely the result
of how much of the time each existing power
plant was operated and which fuel they
utilized, rather than investment in new
capacity. The major changes were the nearly
complete phase-out of fuel oil by 2007
because of high oil prices, a reduction in coal
operation relative to natural gas since 2007
because of low natural gas prices, and a
doubling of large hydro imports into New
England from Canada. These developments
demonstrate that the electricity sector even
as it exists can operate more cleanly.

Clean Energy Imports
Canada has substantial hydro-electric
resources, which have very low emissions
and are available at relatively low cost, but
transmission lines that deliver this resource
to southern New England are currently at full
capacity. One effort to tap more of this
resource is the Northern Pass transmission
line being developed by NSTAR and
Northeast Utilities, in partnership with Hydro
Quebec (HQ) and with the support of the
Patrick-Murray administration. When this
power line is completed, at HQ’s expense, it
will bring to New England enough
inexpensive clean power to serve up to 15
percent of Massachusetts’ present electricity
demand. Additional transmission lines may
also be possible.

This Plan will provide a signal to electricity
suppliers to maintain and improve upon
these cleaner energy portfolios by proposing
a Clean Energy Standard, which would
require electricity suppliers to increasingly
favor low-emissions and no-emissions
sources in the mix of electricity delivered to
their customers. This could be designed to
favor in the long-term sources like wind,
solar, and hydro, which emit no GHGs, but
also initially favor cleaner fossil fuels like
natural gas, to act as a bridge to a clean
energy future.

Federal Clean Air Act Implementation
The Supreme Court, in its 2007 decision
Massachusetts vs. Environmental Protection
Agency, ordered the EPA to regulate GHG
under the Clean Air Act (CAA) as ―pollution
which may reasonably be anticipated to
endanger public health and welfare.‖ While
the CAA is federal law covering the entire
country, it is largely implemented by the
states, which are often better suited to
understand local industries and conditions.
Implementation of the CAA will provide the
dirtiest power plants the choice of making
upgrades in control technology of those
plants or retiring them.

Existing Policy
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD (RPS)
Policy summary: The Massachusetts RPS was created as part of electricity restructuring in
Massachusetts in 1997 and then expanded in the Green Communities Act of 2008 38. The RPS
requires retail electricity suppliers — both distribution companies and other retail suppliers — to
buy a percentage of their portfolio of electricity sales from eligible resources.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

1.1 million metric tons, 1.2%

Clean energy economy impacts: Over the period from 2010 to 2020, the Massachusetts RPS
classes will stimulate $360 million in annual investment, or $3.9 billion in cumulative investment
in clean power generation that would have not occurred on its own. This is expected to create
approximately 900 full-time construction jobs throughout that period.
Rationale: Because of low prices for fossil fuels, the lack of a market price for the negative
impacts of pollution from fossil fuels (―externalities‖), and other market barriers, the private
market is not, on its own, supplying as much renewable, low-carbon power as society needs. By
creating market demand, Renewable Portfolio Standards drive investments in renewable energy
supply.
Policy design: The Massachusetts RPS includes ―technology banding‖ in classes, with the Green
Communities Act expanding the number of renewable classes to the following: Class 1 — New
Renewables; Class 1 — Solar Carve-Out; Class 2 — Existing Renewables; and the Alternative
Portfolio Standard (APS). Suppliers meet their commitments by buying Renewable Energy Credits
(RECs), the accounting mechanism for ensuring that every unit of renewable energy generated is
counted exactly once in terms of state requirements. As a result of the Green Communities Act,
the RPS will require 15 percent of electricity supply to be from new Class 1 renewable resources,
such as wind, solar, small hydro and eligible biomass and anaerobic digestion, by 2020. In total,
all classes will account for 27 percent of electricity supply in that year.
GHG impact: 1.1 million tons of emissions will be avoided in 2020, from the expansion of the
RPS due to the Green Communities Act, not including the RPS requirements that existed prior to
the Act.
Other benefits: As with other electric sector policies, the RPS results in reduced burning of
fossil fuels and therefore reduced local air pollution and improved public health. For example, a
study by the independent National Research Council found that coal use around the country
resulted in 20,000 premature deaths annually.39
Cost: There is a great deal of uncertainty in cost estimates for the RPS, due to unknown future
changes in fuel prices, federal policies, and technology. Just in the last three years REC prices
have dropped by a factor of three. A more detailed electricity supply study is underway. Although

some renewable power is relatively high-cost, the RPS also helps to reduce electricity prices
throughout New England, due to the mechanics of the regional electricity market. Power, like
many other commodities, is bought and sold both under longer-term contracts and in a ―spot‖
market. The spot market price is set by the most expensive supply needed to meet demand at a
particular time. New renewable resources that have low operating costs displace the most
expensive supply needed to meet demand, thereby reducing prices for all spot market power and
providing savings to all customers.
Experience in other states: Twenty-four states have some type of Renewable Portfolio
Standard. Key features of successful programs are those which provide transparency, longevity,
and certainty to the market. Repeated changes to the program design create concern in the
market.
Legal authority: RPS authority derives from electricity restructuring statues from the late
1990s as well as the Green Communities Act.
Implementation issues: The RPS (Class I) program compliance began in 2003. After several
years in which eligible renewable generation fell short of requirements, and while project
development continued to make progress, the program has successfully met its annual
compliance obligation with new renewable energy since 2007. In 2009, the minimum standard of
5 percent was met, though an increasing portion of the generation is coming from imports from
New York and adjacent Canadian provinces into the New England region.
Since the restructuring of energy markets in Massachusetts in 1997, supply contracts between
the electric distribution companies and power generators have typically been for only three
months to one year, far too short a period to allow financing of the high capital costs involved in
developing renewable generating facilities. This has been a contributing factor in limiting supplies
of RPS-eligible renewables in Massachusetts. To rectify this problem, the Green Communities Act
required that the distribution companies solicit proposals from renewable energy developers and
enter into cost-effective long-term contracts for at least a limited amount of renewable energy, in
order to facilitate the financing of renewable energy generation. Such contracts can assist
renewable energy developers in obtaining financing by providing assurance of revenues from
sales of RECs and electricity over a number of years.
Uncertainty: Siting constraints both for generation nearby or for transmission to remote
resources could constrain the renewable supply. In addition, restructured markets like New
England may lack parties to enter into long-term power purchase agreements that are often
required for financing of renewable energy projects, particularly at a time of low natural gas
prices.

Existing Policy
REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE (RGGI)
Policy summary: Massachusetts is one of the 10 Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states participating
in a regional effort to limit carbon dioxide emissions from electric generating units in the region 40.
The program, which began in January 2009, establishes a region-wide cap on CO2 emissions from
fossil fuel-fired power plants in the region. The current program design calls for the cap to remain
at the initial level for six years (2009 to 2014), and then to decrease at 2.5 percent per year for
the next four years, for a total reduction of 10 percent by 2018.
By the end of each three-year compliance period, facilities covered under the program are
required to have purchased allowances — a limited authorization to emit one ton of CO2 — equal
to their total emissions; the allowances are then retired so they cannot be used again. Allowances
are made available by the states for purchase in quarterly auctions. Massachusetts is investing
over 80 percent of its auction proceeds in energy efficiency, with smaller amounts for renewable
energy and other consumer benefit programs.
Clean energy economy impacts: Over $120 million in auction proceeds has been invested in
energy efficiency projects across the Commonwealth since 2009, creating jobs in the clean
energy economy. In addition, the efficiency investments will reduce electricity and fuel costs for
property owners, leaving them with savings to be invested elsewhere in the local economy.
Rationale: The electric generating sector represents approximately a quarter of total GHG
emissions in Massachusetts at present. The RGGI program provides a transparent and stable
signal to the electricity sector to plan for a cleaner energy future. In addition, improvements in
building energy efficiency reduce the demand for electricity and help keep emissions below the
cap, reducing the cost of compliance.
Policy design: Recent trends in relative fuel prices, weather, investments in energy efficiency,
and the downturn in the economy have resulted in actual total regional emissions much lower
than anticipated. The RGGI states, along with broad stakeholder engagement, are currently in the
process of a comprehensive program review which will include evaluation of program success,
program impacts, additional reductions, imports and emission leakage, and offsets.
GHG impact: RGGI has a regional emissions cap, providing for a 10 percent reduction in CO2
emissions across the 10-state region by 2018, and there is no specific limit on emissions deriving
from the power plants in a particular state. Massachusetts’ significant policies for electrical energy
efficiency and renewable electricity are supported, in part, by proceeds from the RGGI auctions.
Therefore, in this Massachusetts-specific analysis, emissions reductions are attributed to all of
these programs in combination.
Other benefits: By providing incentives for reduced operation of the dirtiest plants and greater
operation of cleaner ones, the RGGI program also reduces criteria and hazardous pollutant
emissions (NOx, SO2, mercury, and fine particulate matter). These reductions will have public
health and environmental benefits.

40

The states participating in the RGGI are CT, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VT.

42

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Costs: Since funds received from sale of RGGI allowances are largely invested in the state’s
utility-administered energy efficiency programs, RGGI’s costs in fractionally higher electricity
prices are offset by reductions in the costs of the efficiency program.
Experience in other states: Other states are in the process of developing and implementing
similar programs. These efforts include the Western Climate Initiative and the Midwest Climate
Accord.
Legal authority: Massachusetts RGGI regulations derive from authority under the Green
Communities Act.
Uncertainty: A range of factors affect emissions from power plants, some under the control of
power plants or the state and some not, ranging from weather and relative prices of fuels used to
generate electricity to the aggressiveness of the implementation of energy efficiency programs.

New Policy
MORE STRINGENT EPA POWER PLANT RULES
Policy summary: The EPA is in the midst of proposing and implementing a variety of
regulations that will affect the nation’s power plant fleet, impacting their allowable water and air
emissions. It is likely that the owners of some older, smaller power plants will find it is not
economical to retrofit their plants to meet EPA’s new regulations, and they will instead choose to
shut down the plants. In Massachusetts, it is possible that two of the state’s older coal-fired
power plants will close. The Somerset Power Station in Somerset last ran in January 2010, and its
permits will eventually expire if it is not restarted. The owner of the Salem Harbor Station in
Salem has indicated that it expects the plant to close within five years. 41
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

1.2 million metric tons; 1.2%

Rationale: Power plant emissions have severe consequences for human health.
Policy design: Among the new rules being proposed by EPA are air emissions regulations
addressing the transport of power plant pollution from one state to another (Clean Air Transport
Rule, or CATR). Power plants contribute to high levels of ground-level ozone and fine particulates.
These rules will require significant reductions in nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions,
which will tend to favor more efficient, cleaner power plants.
The Clean Air Act also requires EPA to propose air emission limits to control the release of
mercury and other hazardous substances contained in power plant fuels (National Emission
Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants) and Maximum Available Control Technology standards).
In addition, under Clean Water Act Section 316(b), cooling water intake structures may need to
be redesigned to minimize the adverse environmental impact associated with the entrainment of
fish, shellfish and their eggs and larvae by power plants drawing in large volumes of water to
condense steam used in making electricity. Finally, Coal Combustion Residuals disposal
regulations will ensure the safe disposal of coal ash.
Legal authority: EPA has the authority to issue new rules under the Clean Air and Clean Water
Acts.
GHG impact: If these rules result in power from two older Massachusetts power plants being
displaced by natural gas-fired power plants, there would be a net 1.2 million metric ton reduction
in CO2e in 2020.
Other benefits: Reduced exposure to fine particulates and ozone will have health and
environmental benefits.

Expanded Policy
CLEAN ENERGY IMPORTS
Policy summary: Canada has substantial hydro-electric resources, which have very low
emissions, and are available at relatively low cost and with no need for renewable energy
subsidies (see Renewable Portfolio Standard, above). The amount of Canadian hydro has risen to
8.5 percent of New England’s electric consumption, but transmission lines that deliver this
resource to southern New England are at full capacity, preventing any additional Canadian hydro
from getting to our market. One effort to tap more of this resource is the Northern Pass
transmission line being developed by two Massachusetts utilities, NSTAR and Northeast Utilities,
in partnership with Hydro Quebec (HQ) and with the support of the Patrick-Murray administration.
When this power line is completed, at HQ’s expense, it will bring to New England enough
inexpensive clean power to serve up to 15 percent of Massachusetts’ present electricity demand.
Additional transmission lines may also be possible.
Clean energy economy impacts:42 The project represents an infrastructure investment in the
region by Hydro Quebec estimated at $1.1 billion. It will create hundreds of jobs related to
clearing and site work, harvesting, construction and materials, including electrical, professional,
and technical services. While the vast majority of these jobs will be in New Hampshire and
Quebec, it is likely to have spillover effects in Massachusetts.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020

5.1 million metric tons; 5.4%

Rationale: Canadian hydro resources are extensive and have low operating costs. The
transmission lines necessary to bring more Canadian hydropower to load centers in southern New
England do not have to be financed by ratepayers apart from the price of delivered electricity,
which will be sold in the competitive market.
Policy design: This policy involves working with the Massachusetts utilities to help overcome
any hurdles.
GHG impact: The Northern Pass transmission line alone would provide 1,200 MW of clean
electricity, enough to power nearly 1 million homes. This would result in up to 5 million tons of
emissions reduction in the Commonwealth, depending on how much of the power is utilized in
Massachusetts versus other states.
Other benefits: Like other electric sector policies, by incentivizing the reduced operation of
fossil fuel plants, these additional low-emissions electricity imports would help reduce criteria and
hazardous pollutants in the air (NOx, SO2, mercury, and fine particulate matter). These
reductions will have public health and environmental benefits. In addition, additional hydro
imports will significantly improve the region’s fuel diversity, improving energy security and price
stability.
Cost: There are no additional costs to this effort to ratepayers or taxpayers. The power is
expected to be sold in the market. In fact, as a ―price-taker‖ in the market, it is possible that it
would lower the wholesale electricity price and therefore reduce costs for business and residential

consumers. According to Northeast Utilities, a comprehensive analysis by Charles River
Associates (CRA) shows that, even with conservative assumptions, the Northern Pass line will
reduce energy prices in the wholesale market, potentially saving New England customers $200
million to $300 million in annual energy costs.
Experience in other states: Massachusetts and other Northeast states already have
transmission lines to Canada and have imported hydro power for years. In fact, additional hydro
power imports have been a significant contributor to a cleaner New England electricity grid in the
last five years.
Legal authority: DPU and DOER have already begun working with utilities and ISO-New
England on increasing such imports.
Uncertainty: Transmission lines involve federal, state and local permitting, and often raise
siting concerns, with potential delays from legal action.

46

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020

New Policy
CLEAN ENERGY PERFORMANCE STANDARD (CPS)
Policy summary: From 2005 to 2009, the electricity portfolio serving Massachusetts became
nearly 20 percent cleaner. The major changes came from substitution of natural gas for coal and
oil, doubling of imports of hydro power from Canada into New England, and the up-rating — or
increasing of capacity — of existing nuclear plants regionally. This demonstrated that mature
technologies have made a significant contribution to a cleaner electricity grid, without the federal
or state incentives required for developing earlier stage technologies. They have an important
role to play moving forward.
A market-based framework is needed to provide a clear signal to the electricity market to
improve upon the cleaner energy portfolios of the last few years and to encourage projects such
as the Northern Pass line (see ―Clean Energy Imports‖ above). One approach to be considered is
a Clean Energy Performance Standard (CPS), which applies an output-based performance
standard to either portfolios of retail electricity sellers or to generators in terms of tons of
pollution per megawatt-hour of electricity. As the performance standard becomes more stringent
over time, the electricity market uses the least-cost mechanism for meeting it. The existing RPS
fits neatly into this framework as a technology-specific means of meeting the standard.
Clean energy economy impacts: The CPS is a transparent and stable market-based
framework that provides market certainty and enables investments to be made. It would
encourage further replacement of power plant capital stock with cleaner technologies and cleaner
fuels while disadvantaging dirtier power plants in the electricity marketplace.
Rationale: By being performance-based rather than technology-based, the CPS allows the
market to find the least-cost approach to achieving a cleaner energy portfolio. In addition, it
could empower electricity suppliers to manage their portfolios, akin to the CAFE standard for
vehicles, offering cleaner products to interested customers to help meet their portfolio targets.
Policy design: Design issues include setting the targets; creating tracking mechanisms,
particularly for system power; allowing tradability among suppliers, and minimizing ―shuffling,‖ in
which generators shift cleaner power to Massachusetts and dirtier power to other states.
Resolving these and other design issues would require substantial consultation with the electricity
industry.
GHG impact: The potential GHG impacts are substantial; however, they are completely
dependent on the targets set and include the impacts from both the RPS and the clean energy
imports. Therefore no additional GHG reductions from this potential policy were included in the
overall estimates.
Other benefits: Like other electric sector policies, by providing incentives for the reduced
operation of the dirtiest plants and greater operation of cleaner ones, a CPS reduces criteria and
hazardous pollutant emissions (NOx, SO2, mercury, and fine particulate matter). These reductions
will have public health and environmental benefits.

47

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Cost: In the near-term, a CPS is likely to have a limited impact on electricity prices for
consumers. 43
Experience in other states: Generator-level performance standards for new generators have
recently been considered or implemented in several states and countries. However, portfolio-level
performance standards for retail sellers of electricity or tradable performance standards for
existing plants are less common, but have been analyzed recently. California has been working
on a preferred loading order meant to encourage dispatch of lower emissions resources.
Legal authority: DOER and DPU will begin analysis of possible paths forward for a creating a
CPS, including regulatory or legislative avenues, as well as cost-benefit and implementation
issues.
Uncertainty: The CPS ensures a cleaner energy portfolio over time. However, since it sets a
limit on the carbon intensity of electricity generation, it does not constrain overall emissions. For
example, if demand growth exceeded expectations, overall emissions would grow. Effective
implementation of energy efficiency policies are a critical complement to mitigate this risk.

currently to 35.5 MPG (in 2016), and for the
first time NHTSA and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) issued joint
regulations that will control both fuel
efficiency and GHG emissions from cars and
light trucks.
During the period when federal CAFE
standards were stagnant, the state of
California passed its own law to regulate
GHG emissions from light vehicles, under a
longstanding waiver provision of the federal
Clean Air Act. Massachusetts law requires
adoption of California’s standards if they are
stricter than the federal ones, and the
Commonwealth did so in December 2005.
These standards apply to model year 2009
and newer vehicles. However, the federal
government requires California to obtain a
waiver of federal law in order to impose its
own emission standards. In 2007 EPA denied
California’s waiver request, although it was
later approved under President Obama.

Transportation
Transportation is second only to buildings in
responsibility for GHG emissions in the state,
and is a fast-growing emissions sector. The
vast majority of emissions come from cars
and trucks, although air travel is a rapidly
rising emissions source. There are several
means of addressing transportation
emissions, all of which Massachusetts has
been pursuing — improving vehicle
efficiency, moderating the growth in auto
travel through providing alternatives to it,
and promoting the development and use of
vehicle fuels that yield lower GHG emissions
than petroleum-based fuels. The
Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate
Plan for 2020 takes into account state and
federal measures to improve vehicle
efficiency, reduce vehicle miles traveled, and
increase use of lower-carbon fuels, and
proposes additional measures that will
contribute toward meeting the 2020 limit.

In October 2010, NHTSA and EPA announced
that they would propose regulations to
require improved efficiency and lower GHG
emissions from medium- and heavy-duty
vehicles, including delivery trucks, buses and
semi trucks (tractor trailers). These will also
yield substantial GHG reductions in
Massachusetts.
This Plan proposes a complementary
measure to improve the overall efficiency of
light-duty vehicles in Massachusetts:
providing incentives to consumers to
purchase more fuel-efficient vehicles. Such
incentives would involve varying charges
and/or rebates on vehicles according to their
GHG emissions per mile (similar to fuel use
per mile) — such as varying the sales tax on
new cars, the annual vehicle excise tax, or
registration fees. The variable charges could
be designed to be revenue-neutral to
consumers as a whole and to the state, with
tax increases and decreases balancing each
other.

Improving Vehicle Efficiency
Improving vehicle efficiency has been
primarily a federal government
responsibility, implemented through
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards first put forth in 1975 by the

Administration (NHTSA). These standards
had been stagnant for many years, but were
raised in the 2007 federal Energy
Independence and Security Act. Under

Reducing Vehicle Miles Travelled (VMT)

forward in June, 2010 with its ―GreenDOT‖
policy directive, which commits MassDOT to
―be a national leader in promoting
sustainability in the transportation sector.‖
Among the three primary goals of GreenDOT
is reducing GHG emissions, in part through
implementation of the Global Warming
Solutions Act.44 Critical to the specific efforts
under GreenDOT is consideration of GHG
impacts in statewide and regional
transportation planning, and in the selection
of particular projects that receive funding in
the regional and statewide transportation
plans.45 GreenDOT also specifies several
other efforts (to be discussed later in this
Plan), such as enhanced support for
alternative modes of transportation and
promotion of ―eco-driving‖ (fuel-saving auto
maintenance and driving practices). GHG
emissions from auto travel can also be
reduced by enabling more efficient roadway
operation through the use of intelligent
transportation systems and mitigating
―bottlenecks‖ that create local congestion, if
such mitigation is designed so that it does
not expand overall system capacity, facilitate
increased auto travel, nor increase GHG
emissions over time.

Massachusetts has a number of programs to
rein in the growth of driving, which is
generally measured by vehicle miles traveled
(VMT). Most of these programs have as their
primary purposes improving mobility options
for state residents by providing alternative
methods of travel and reducing congestion
on the roads, and reducing air pollutants that
damage human health, such as nitrogen
oxides, carbon monoxide, and particulates.
Among these are support for public transit
and for infrastructure that improves
conditions for bicyclists and pedestrians. The
state also operates programs that encourage
ride-sharing among commuters, van pooling,
and employer-based methods for reducing
single-occupancy travel to work.
The amount of driving is greatly influenced
by patterns of new housing and business
development in the state. The more spread
out development is, the more driving people
must do to get to work and school, to shop
and participate in other activities. Although
decisions on development are primarily up to
local governments and the private sector,
the state has several policies designed to
influence them. The state has issued
Sustainable Development Principles to guide
state agency programs, as well as
investment in land and infrastructure. The
principles call for encouraging building
homes ―near jobs, transit, and where
services are available,‖ and encourage the
creation of pedestrian-friendly
neighborhoods — practices known as ―smart
growth‖. Adherence to the principles is aided
by the Commonwealth Capital program,
under which about $600 million annually in
grants and loans for municipalities is
distributed in part on the basis of
communities meeting sustainable
development criteria.

This Plan proposes several new policies to
aid in the effort to limit miles traveled. First,
an extension of policies to steer new
development toward smart growth —
through a new law designed to improve local
zoning, provide assistance to communities to
help them develop zoning policies, and
require that state infrastructure funding

Although Green DOT is now an ―existing‖ state policy,
it was released subsequent to completion of ERG’s
February 2010 report on the impacts of the state’s
current GHG reduction policies, and so was not included
in those numerical estimates. Therefore in the present
document the impacts of GreenDOT are treated as
―new‖ policies.

The Massachusetts Department of
Transportation (MassDOT) took a major step

decisions take into account impacts on GHG
emissions.

what degree GHG emissions are reduced
compared to petroleum fuels. As a result,
Massachusetts has concentrated its efforts
on supporting non-food crop based or
―advanced‖ biofuels, and has required that
alternatives to petroleum demonstrate
significant GHG benefits.

Second, the Plan proposes that the state
implement a pilot program of ―Pay As You
Drive‖ (PAYD) auto insurance, with the
possibility of its expansion later. PAYD is an
innovation that many studies have shown
would significantly reduce miles driven,46 by
converting a fixed annual cost into a cost
that varies by the amount of driving. In
addition, average insurance costs across all
drivers would fall, as less driving also means
fewer accidents, and there would be
significant reductions in traffic congestion,
particularly in urban areas.

In 2008, Governor Patrick signed the Clean
Energy Biofuels Act, which has several parts.
First, it exempts non-food crop based, or
cellulosic, biofuel from the state’s gasoline
tax. Second, it requires that initially 2
percent of the diesel fuel and home heating
fuel sold in the state consist of bio-diesel,
rising to 5 percent in 2013. However, the
bio-diesel must be shown to yield a 50
percent reduction in GHG emissions
compared to petroleum diesel. A lack of
supply of such fuel, along with other
obstacles to implementation, have caused
the state to delay implementation of the
content mandate. Third, the Act instructs the
state to pursue development of a ―low
carbon fuel standard‖ (LCFS) on a regional
basis throughout the Northeast. The LCFS
concept originated in California, where the
legal target is to reduce the average carbon
content of motor fuel 10 percent by 2020.
During the past two years Massachusetts has
been leading an effort by the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic states to construct such a
standard. A target for the Northeast/MidAtlantic LCFS has not been set.

Reducing the Carbon Content of Vehicle
Fuel
Emissions controls on cars have greatly cut
emissions of health-damaging pollutants
such as nitrogen dioxide. But such controls
are unable to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions from petroleum fuels, the primary
GHG pollutant. As a result, to limit the GHG
emissions from vehicle fuel, it is necessary to
find alternatives to gasoline and petroleumbased diesel fuel, such as bio-diesel, ethanol,
natural gas, and electricity.
In recent years, the actual GHG benefits of
liquid biofuels made from food crops, such as
corn-based ethanol and soy-based bio-diesel,
have been questioned. When one examines
the entire lifecycle of such fuels, including
their impacts on food supplies and
deforestation, it is unclear whether and to

In addition, two federal laws are designed to
bring more alternative fuels into the market.
First, Title II of the federal Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007
creates a ―renewable fuel standard,‖ which
requires that such fuel used in the U.S. will
rise from 4.7 billion gallons in 2007 to 36
billion gallons in 2022. Of that, "advanced
biofuel" must rise from 0.6 billion gallons in
2009 to 21 billion gallons in 2022, and
cellulosic biofuel must rise from 0.1 billion
gallons in 2010 to 16 billion gallons in 2022.
Renewable fuels must be produced from

credit rises with battery capacity to a
maximum of $7,500.
This Plan relies primarily on development of
a regional Low Carbon Fuel Standard, along
with the federal policies described above, to
obtain reductions in the average carbon
content of vehicle fuels; which constitutes
one of the three main methods of reducing
GHG emissions from transportation.

FEDERAL AND CALIFORNIA VEHICLE EFFICIENCY AND GHG STANDARDS
Policy Summary: The EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
have set harmonized standards for light-duty vehicle MPG and GHG emissions for model year
2012 through 2016 vehicles. The standard is raised from 27.5 MPG at present to 35.5 MPG in
2016. California has harmonized its standards with the federal standards through 2016, but is
expected to propose stricter standards for model year 2017 to 2020 vehicles, and Massachusetts
law requires the Commonwealth to adopt the California standards. In combination, the EPA and
California standards are forecast to yield a 17 percent reduction in GHG emissions in 2020
(primarily from lower gasoline consumption, but also with some reduced emissions from vehicle
air conditioning systems).

Note: benefits are calculated over the lifetimes of vehicles purchased from 2012 through 2020, which
extend beyond 2020.

Clean energy economy impacts: The vast majority of spending on motor fuel goes out of
state, so reducing those expenditures by billions of dollars means more money can be spent on
in-state businesses, stimulating the economy and creating jobs.
Rationale: Federal fuel economy (CAFE) standards were first enacted in 1975 but have been
relatively stagnant since the 1980s. Federal law raised them in 2007, but the Obama
administration proposed an accelerated schedule through 2016. Improving the fuel economy of
vehicles is one of the most effective tools to reduce energy consumption and GHG emissions.
Design issues: The federal regulations continue the practice of having different standards for
cars and light trucks, although two-wheel drive SUVs will be reclassified as cars. EPA/NHTSA
project the fraction of vehicles sold in the two categories; average MPG and fuel savings could be
lower than expected if a higher proportion of light trucks are sold.
GHG impact: 2.4 million tons in 2020 for Massachusetts, based on EPA/NHTSA and California
projections.
Other benefits: EPA’s benefit calculations include lower air pollution from vehicles, less time
spent refueling, security benefits of lower petroleum imports, and the social value of lower carbon
emissions.
Costs: About $3.4 billion in additional vehicle costs through 2020, far outweighed by $11.4
billion in reduced fuel costs (all in net present value).
Equity issues: Both higher initial capital costs and subsequent fuel savings will accrue first to
purchasers of new vehicles. Lower income drivers more commonly buy used vehicles, and will
only be affected in later years as the new models are sold on the used car market.

53

II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Experience in other states: The federal regulations are required in all states. Massachusetts
and a number of other states have adopted California’s stricter standards in the past, with no
implementation problems.
Legal authority: The federal government has authority over vehicle efficiency and air
emissions. However, there is an exemption under the 1970 Clean Air Act for California to adopt
standards stricter than EPA’s (if awarded a waiver by EPA) and for other states to adopt
California’s standards.
Implementation issues: None.
Uncertainty: See discussion under ―design issues‖ concerning the distribution of sales between
cars and light trucks.

FEDERAL EMISSIONS AND FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR MEDIUM- AND
HEAVY-DUTY VEHICLES
Policy summary: The EPA and the DOT have announced complementary programs to reduce
GHG emissions and improve fuel efficiency, respectively, for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles,
such as the largest pickup trucks and vans, combination tractors 47, and all types and size of work
trucks and buses in between, for model years 2014-2018.

1,000 jobs

Clean energy economy impacts: Using commercially available technologies, a payback period
of one to two years is estimated for the majority of vehicles. Vehicles with lower annual miles
would have payback periods of four to five years. For example, an operator of a semi truck could
pay for the technology upgrades in under a year, and have net savings up to $74,000 over the
truck’s useful life.49 Large reductions in fuel use will improve air quality. Less spending on
imported fuel will keep more money in the Massachusetts economy and thereby create jobs.
Rationale: Transportation is projected to account for close to 40 percent of total GHG emissions
in Massachusetts in 2020, and medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are projected to account for 13
percent of transportation sector emissions. These vehicle standards will reduce fuel consumption
and GHG emissions while providing regulatory certainty for manufacturers.
GHG impact: 0.34 percent of statewide GHG emissions in 2020, based on a reduction of 6.4
percent in emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
Equity issues: The federal regulations are carefully designed to set efficiency standards that are
appropriate and cost-effective for different sizes and types of vehicles. There are no significant
predicted equity issues with the promulgation of this federal regulation.
Uncertainty: Current projections of the impact of these standards by the EPA and NHTSA may
not turn out to be correct, in terms of fuel savings and costs and benefits, as the regulation is not
final. In addition, if manufacturers cannot meet the standard and pay penalties instead, then GHG
and fuel consumption targets will not be met.

FEDERAL RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD AND REGIONAL LOW CARBON FUEL
STANDARD
Policy summary: Title II of the federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 creates
a ―renewable fuel standard,‖ which requires that the volume of renewable fuels used in the U.S.
will rise from 4.7 billion gallons in 2007 to 36 billion gallons in 2022. In a similar fashion,
Massachusetts’ biofuels law, passed in 2008, instructs the state to pursue development of a ―low
carbon fuel standard‖ (LCFS) on a regional basis throughout the Northeast. The LCFS (first
developed by California) would require that the average carbon intensity of vehicle fuels fall by a
specific percentage compared to petroleum fuels.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020

1.5 million metric tons; 1.6%

Clean energy economy impacts: To the degree that imported petroleum used in
Massachusetts can be replaced by feedstocks such as solid waste, forest residues, and other
cellulosic material, money that would otherwise go overseas is retained in the regional economy.
If advanced fuels (including electricity powering plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles)
eventually become less expensive than petroleum fuels, consumer costs are expected to fall.
There are significant economic development opportunities in growing feedstocks, converting
those into fuel, and in research and development. The report of the Massachusetts Advanced
Biofuels Task Force forecast that the sector could employ 2,500 people in the state by 2025.
Rationale: The carbon intensity (or GHG emissions per unit of energy used) of fuel is one of the
three main ways that emissions from motor vehicles can be reduced. In theory, if crops or other
plants are used to produce fuel, the emissions from burning the fuel can be canceled out by the
re-growth of plants on the same land absorbing equal amounts of carbon dioxide during its
growth. Given the United States’ large supply of land and agricultural produce, this is a logical
method of reducing the use of petroleum. In addition, if electric vehicles become prominent, they
would reduce the carbon intensity of fuels, since electric motors are far more efficient at powering
motor vehicles than are gasoline engines.
Policy design and issues: Under the Federal RFS, supplies of "advanced biofuel" (including
cellulosic) must rise from 0.6 billion gallons in 2009 to 21 billion gallons in 2022, and cellulosic
biofuel by itself must rise to 16 billion gallons in 2022. Advanced biofuel excludes ethanol derived
from corn starch, and must yield at least a 50 percent lifecycle reduction in GHG emissions, while
cellulosic biofuel must achieve a 60 percent reduction. Renewable fuels that don’t qualify as
advanced can constitute up to 15 billion out of the 36 billion total gallons of fuel; they must still
be produced from renewable biomass, replace other transportation fuel, and achieve at least a 20
percent reduction in GHG emissions on a lifecycle basis for "new facilities." Existing facilities, and
expansion of such facilities, such as those producing corn-based ethanol, are exempt from the
GHG criterion, leaving some question as to how much of the non-advanced fuel will actually meet
the 20 percent criterion.
As required by the Biofuels Act, during the past two years Massachusetts has been leading an
effort by the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to develop a Low Carbon Fuel Standard in the
region. The LCFS concept originated in California, where regulations require a reduction in the

56

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

average carbon content of motor fuel of 10 percent by 2020. Targets and timelines for the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic LCFS are being developed. Unlike the RFS, the LCFS is a ―technology
neutral‖ standard — rather than requiring specific volumes of different fuels, it allows fuel
suppliers to choose any motor fuel in any quantity — including petroleum, biofuels, natural gas,
electricity, and other possibilities. First, the average carbon intensity of each fuel is determined.
If the intensity of a particular fuel exceeds the annual target, then suppliers of this fuel have a
―deficit‖ and must purchase credits from sellers of fuels that have a carbon intensity below the
annual target.
A major issue for the RFS and the LCFS is calculating the carbon intensity of different fuels. This
requires examining the entire lifecycle of a fuel, including, for example, how electricity is
generated and how crops are grown — calculations that are difficult to do with any degree of
precision. Important numerically, and controversial, are the carbon impacts from what is known
as ―indirect land use change‖ (ILUC). When large amounts of food crops are used for fuel (corn
for ethanol, soybeans or rapeseed for biodiesel), this may cause the need for more food
production. Forests may be cut down to expand the amount of land on which crops can be grown,
causing reductions in the CO2 sequestered by trees and soil. The US EPA and the California Air
Resources Board (CARB), along with the European Union and specific European countries, are
currently calculating ILUC for each fuel, but each source has published different numbers. The
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states are examining which methodologies and figures are best to use,
and these choices substantially affect how much ―credit‖ each fuel would receive under the LCFS.
There are a number of other design issues involved in constructing a regional LCFS for the 11
states currently involved, and an interstate group of agency staff, along with an interstate agency
— the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) — have been
addressing design issues for the past two years.
GHG impact: For purposes of this Plan, the LCFS is estimated conservatively to achieve a 5
percent reduction in the average carbon content of vehicle fuel by 2020, with greater reductions
in following years. The LCFS is more specifically focused on GHG reductions than the federal RFS.
Without the LCFS, the RFS by itself might yield about a 3 percent reduction, depending on what
reductions are actually achieved from corn-based ethanol produced throughout the U.S.
Other benefits: Possible reductions in other air pollutants, depending on which fuels are used in
place of petroleum.
Costs: NESCAUM is working on a regional economic analysis which will be available in early
2011. This analysis will include estimates of cost and benefits to the region and to each state.
Equity issues: Any price impacts from the RFS and LCFS will be spread across all drivers in
proportion to the amount of fuel that they use.
Experience in other states: California has adopted regulations for implementation of its LCFS,
which goes into effect in 2011.
Legal authority: Massachusetts’ biofuels law gives the state the authority to implement the
LCFS. In other participating states, new regulations or legislation will be necessary, or both.
Implementation issues: As with any interstate policy, achieving agreement on how to
implement a uniform policy among a number of states presents many complexities. The

57

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

interstate effort currently underway, led by Massachusetts and NESCAUM, is addressing these.
For example, distribution infrastructure for new fuels and vehicles may be needed. This would
require large capital investments (e.g., liquid fuel distribution for biofuels, charging stations for
electricity, etc.) and it is unclear whether the incentive system created by the LCFS will be
sufficient to draw out that investment. Nor is it clear whether the auto manufacturers will develop
the vehicles needed to utilize the fuel, particularly in the case of plug-in hybrid and all-electric
vehicles. Complementary policies may be necessary for all parts of the system to be developed in
tandem.
Uncertainty: As a technology-neutral policy, the LCFS is not picking between the several
possibilities for alternatives to petroleum, and it is uncertain at this time which ones will succeed
best in terms of eventual cost, and what that cost will be.

CLEAN CAR CONSUMER INCENTIVES
Policy summary: There are various means by which the Commonwealth could provide incentives
for consumers to shift their vehicle purchases to more fuel-efficient (or lower GHG) models. This
includes varying the rates on new car sales taxes, annual auto excise (property) taxes, and
registration fees, with rates raised on low-MPG vehicles and reduced on high-MPG ones. The
change could be designed to be revenue-neutral to consumers as a whole and to the state.

Jobs gained in 2020 (direct and indirect)

1,700 jobs

Clean energy economy impacts: Large reductions in fuel costs for consumers, and less
spending on imported fuel, which keeps more money in the Massachusetts economy and thereby
creates jobs. For a tax or fee that varies with CO2 but is still a percentage of vehicle price or
value, and is revenue neutral to the state, costs would fall for a majority of auto buyers or
owners (possibly around 60 percent), because the most expensive vehicles also tend to get the
worst MPG and these would bring in much greater revenues.
Rationale: Transportation is expected to account for close to 40 percent of total GHG emissions
in Massachusetts in 2020, and light vehicles by themselves (cars, SUVs, minivans, pickups)
around 28 percent of the total. The efficiency of the vehicles themselves is probably the easiest
factor to influence among the several that determine vehicle emissions (the others being miles
traveled and carbon content of the fuel). Although the federal government preempts authority
over setting efficiency standards for automakers, the state does have the ability to influence
consumer choice through tax and fee policies. Given the state’s budget realities, a policy that
combines incentives and disincentives can be accomplished without a loss of tax revenue.
Design issues: The simplest design, which has been proposed in California and Europe, is a
charge measured in cents per gram of carbon per mile driven, or cents per gallon per mile driven,
varying linearly from a minimum to a maximum rate. This would provide the strongest incentive,
but would not be tied to the price of the vehicle. A tax or fee that varied by carbon emissions but
was a percentage of vehicle sales price or current value (for vehicle property taxes or registration
fees) would concentrate the impact on buyers of more expensive vehicles, but would provide a
weaker incentive to buy fuel-efficient vehicles.
In addition, there could be rate variations designed to assist particular groups of drivers, such as
those with large families who need vehicles with seating capacity for six or more, or contractors
who need trucks for their businesses.
The tax or fee design could be revenue-neutral to the state and to consumers as a whole, with
reductions and increases in payments balancing out. The sales tax on motor vehicles in

Massachusetts is currently 6.25 percent, as for all non-exempt products. Preliminary modeling by
the state, with the rates varying from 0 percent to twice the current sales tax rate, found that
expensive, low-MPG vehicles would yield a large tax revenue increase. In order to maintain
revenue neutrality, the entire tax schedule would shift down, with the most efficient vehicles
(hybrids) having a negative rate (receiving a rebate) while the top rate would be significantly
below 12.5 percent.
GHG impact: For a variable sales tax, the impact would vary from around 0.2 million to 0.4
million metric tons, due to an improvement of 1 percent to 2 percent in average vehicle fuel
efficiency, as estimated by Cambridge Systematics, Inc. For a change to vehicle excise taxes or
registration fees, the dollar amounts are lower and the impact would be lower. In the table
above, the larger impact is from a straight fee on CO2 emitted per mile driven, that replaces the
current sales tax, as has been proposed by California. The smaller impact is from a fee that
varies according to CO2 emissions but is a percentage of vehicle purchase price.
Other benefits: Fewer large, heavy vehicles on the road will reduce injury and death rates from
accidents. Reduced fuel usage will cut emissions of other air pollutants that cause human health
damage.
Costs: Minimal costs to administer. The state would devise tax or fee rate schedules and provide
these to auto dealers or the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV). Dealers already handle the sales
tax through an electronic connection to the RMV.
Equity issues: Lower-income households tend to buy used cars, whose sales tax rates will not
change under this proposal. For new vehicles, size, weight and gas consumption are highly
correlated with purchase price, so the tax increases will tend to be felt by higher-income
purchasers, with buyers of smaller, cheaper cars seeing decreases in their sales taxes. Beyond
the initial purchase price, virtually all drivers whose vehicle choice is modified by the incentive
mechanism will see substantial savings in gasoline costs over time.
Experience in other states: California has proposed a version of the sliding-scale sales tax,
with the tax varying directly with CO2 emissions, in their climate planning process, and legislation
is pending.
Legal authority: Legislation is required to change the tax rates. In some cases, fees such as
registration fees can be changed by agencies without new legislation. EEA and MassDOT will
conduct a study to examine critical implementation challenges and possible regulatory or
legislative paths forward.
Implementation issues: Changes will be needed to the RMV’s computer systems. In order to
maintain revenue neutrality, it will probably be necessary to adjust fees, rebates or tax rates over
time.
Uncertainty: The degree of consumer response to changes in taxes or fees is not precisely
known, so the gains in reduced emissions and the exact tax revenues will only be seen with
experience.

PAY AS YOU DRIVE (PAYD) AUTO INSURANCE PILOT
Policy Summary: PAYD would convert a large fixed annual premium into a variable cost based
on miles traveled, creating a major incentive to reduce discretionary driving, while cutting the
overall cost of insurance due to fewer accidents. Miles driven would fall substantially, along with
CO2 emissions and costs for gasoline, accidents, and congestion. The Commonwealth plans to
conduct a PAYD pilot program initially, and, depending on results, consider working with the
insurance industry to make this payment method more widely available in future years. Benefits
from PAYD would depend on its degree of adoption by insurance companies and consumers.
Benefits from full-scale PAYD implementation

Note: The lower end of the benefits range is for a voluntary system, higher end is for a mandatory system
with the entire insurance charge on a per-mile basis. A middle option, with a mandatory system that has a
flat charge for the first 2,000 miles and a per-mile charge beyond that, would yield about 1.0 million tons
GHG reduction in 2020, from a 5 percent reduction in vehicle miles traveled.

Clean energy economy impacts: For a reduction of 5 percent in VMT (middle policy option),
motor fuel spending would fall by $440 million at 2020 projected gas prices. Less spending on
imported fuel will keep more money in the Massachusetts economy and thereby create jobs. A
Brookings Institution study estimated that rates would fall for two-thirds of drivers, while rising
for one-third. Benefits would accrue particularly to lower-income drivers, who need a vehicle for
employment but can save money by controlling non-essential driving. Less congestion will
improve quality of life.
Rationale: Transportation is expected to account for close to 40 percent of total GHG emissions
in Massachusetts in 2020, and light vehicles by themselves (cars, SUVs, minivans, pickups)
around 28 percent of the total. One way to reduce emissions is by reducing VMT. At present,
insurance premiums do not vary by VMT (though there is precedent in current discounts for low
usage, such as 5,000 miles/year) and so they have little impact on people’s driving habits. If
insurance were converted into a per-mile charge it would give drivers a new incentive to limit
their driving when they can.
Design issues: Design of the program would depend upon the results of the pilot program. It is
expected that the per-mile rate would not be uniform, but rather would vary by the traditional

61

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

rating factors, including location and driver experience. Thus, miles driven would only be one
factor determining rates. For example, an inexperienced driver living in Boston would likely pay a
per mile rate substantially higher than that of an experienced driver living in western
Massachusetts. Because insurance companies set their rates by accident costs within a
geographic area, PAYD would not favor urban residents over suburban or rural ones. PAYD would
be ―revenue neutral‖ within a particular area, favoring low-mileage drivers over high-mileage
ones.
GHG impact: 0.4 percent to 2.1 percent of statewide GHG emissions in 2020, based on a
reduction of 2 percent (for a voluntary system) to 9.5 percent (for a mandatory system with
charges entirely by the mile) in vehicle miles traveled. A nationwide study by the Brookings
Institution found that PAYD insurance would reduce VMT by 8 percent.
Other benefits: Accidents, and the associated injuries, deaths, and monetary costs, would fall
greatly, particularly in congested areas. In the middle policy option, there would be an estimated
reduction in crashes of 11,000, 7,000 fewer injuries, and 36 fewer fatalities, yielding $420 million
in total benefits, part of which would accrue to drivers in lower insurance rates. Congestion, and
the lost time and money that result, would also fall significantly, particularly in urban areas.
Cambridge Systematics, Inc. estimates that statewide congestion would be cut substantially.
There would also be reductions in other air pollutants from motor vehicles, which will have health
benefits.
Costs: On average, insurance costs would fall across all drivers. Costs would vary by driver,
rising for high-mileage drivers who are unable to modify their driving habits. If mileage is
monitored through annual safety inspections, as is done at present, there would be little
additional cost for either drivers or the state. VMT could also be monitored through telematic
devices in cars, which currently cost $100 to $200 per unit. These costs will probably fall as the
devices become more common, and wouldn’t be needed for vehicles that already have GPS
systems. A gradual transition could be made by requiring the devices for new cars, but allowing
use of the safety inspection data for older cars.
Equity issues: The MIT study for Massachusetts finds that accident costs are related to miles
driven, and therefore having insurance rates tied to VMT improves fairness among drivers.
Initially rates would increase for approximately one-third of drivers, but ultimately rates should
decline for a higher fraction of all drivers due to reduced accident costs. Relative rates for
different population groups — inexperienced drivers, adults, and senior citizens — would not
change significantly, nor would relative rates between different areas of the state.
The most recent data available on vehicle miles traveled by income level is for 2001, and only at
the national level.51 It shows that on average middle-income families drive about three-fourths as
much as high-income families, and that low-income families drive about half as much as highincome ones. A Brookings Institution study found that, nationwide, lower-income households
would generally save money due to PAYD while higher-income households would, on average,
pay more, as shown in Figure 7 on page 63.52

Noel)

Experience in other states: PAYD does not exist as a mandatory system anywhere in the
U. S., but several insurance companies have pilot programs, including Progressive Insuran ce
and GMAC. Pilots are also taking place in the United Kingdom. Several states are attempting to
encourage PAYD, including Texas, California, and Oregon. The Federal Highway Administration
is making available about $10 million for PAYD pilots in the next fiscal year. Fourteen states
have PAYD in their climate action plans. Maryland forecasts that PAYD has the potential to
reduce GHG emissions there by 1 million tons in 2015 and 4.3 million tons in 2020. 53
Legal authority: The state’s Division of Insurance has authority over auto insurance rates. At
present the Division can allow companies to offer PAYD but cannot require them to do so.
Legislation would be needed to require companies to provide PAYD as an option, or to require
them to put all policies on a per mile basis.
Implementation issues: If the state does not require insurance companies to offer PAYD,
insurance companies are unlikely to do so, as has been the case in other states. If the policy is
optional for drivers, only a fraction may choose it, greatly reducing the impacts on GHG emissions
and savings for drivers. Monitoring VMT through annual inspections carries the risk of errors, and
will significantly reduce the incentive mechanism, by giving drivers feedback only once per year.
Use of a telematic device that can be used to bill drivers monthly for their insurance would be
more effective in influencing driver behavior. Information on costs could also be provided on a
real-time basis through an on-board device or through a web site look-up. Some drivers might
have privacy concerns about their driving being monitored telematically, even if the information
is limited to VMT. In addition, the Brookings study argues that the cost of the telematic devices
exceeds the benefits to the companies, so that incentives may be needed in order to achieve the
social benefits of lower pollution, accidents, and congestion.
Uncertainty: Projections of the impact of PAYD on driving may not be correct, with actual VMT
reductions lower than expected. In addition, administrative costs could be higher than expected.

Existing Policy
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES
Policy summary: In 2007, the Patrick-Murray Administration updated the Massachusetts
Sustainable Development Principles to guide creation and implementation of state agency policies
and programs, as well as investments in land and infrastructure. Municipalities, through policies
like Commonwealth Capital, are also encouraged to modify their planning, regulatory, and
funding actions to achieve consistency with the principles. The principles include promoting clean
energy, in the form of energy efficiency and renewable power generation, in order to reduce GHG
emissions and consumption of fossil fuels. They also encourage reductions in vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) through actions such as the creation of ―pedestrian-friendly‖ districts and
neighborhoods that mix commercial, civic, cultural, educational, and recreational activities with
parks and homes. In regard to housing, the principles call for building homes ―near jobs, transit,
and available services.‖
State investments, particularly those in infrastructure, have an important influence on where and
how growth occurs. The principles are intended to guide policies, programs, and expenditures,
particularly those that affect where and how development occurs. Making state investments
consistent with the principles increases the amount of growth that takes place in locations and
densities that reduce VMT and GHG emissions and have other clean energy benefits.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020 (in
conjunction with Commonwealth Capital and MEPA)

0.1 million metric
tons; 0.1%

Clean energy economy impacts: Sustainable Development Principle #9 — Promote Clean
Energy — explicitly encourages clean energy practices, aiding development of clean energy jobs
and reduced energy costs. Also, Sustainable Development Principle #1 — Concentrate
Development and Mix Use, along with Sustainable Development Principle #7 — Provide
Transportation Choice, can enable significant transportation cost reductions for residents and
business due to reduced vehicle ownership and fuel consumption. Finally, Principle #1 will help to
increase building efficiency and make district energy and combined heat and power more
feasible.
Rationale: The principles provide a value statement and basic guide that state and municipal
employees, business interests, land owners, developers, conservation groups, and others can
turn to when making choices about their actions and investments. State policies, such as
Commonwealth Capital, have the principles as their foundation. These policies expand upon the
principles and provide an incentive to implement them.
Policy design: Readily implemented, since legislation is not required and regulatory changes
would be minimal. However, improving the consistency of a large number of programs with the
principles will require Executive leadership, perseverance, and a willingness to overcome
obstacles.
One example of a state program that has utilized the Sustainable Development Principles is the
Commonwealth Capital Program. More than $600 million in grants and low interest loans are
awarded annually based in part on Commonwealth Capital scoring. Municipal smart growth/smart
energy consistency is assessed through a Commonwealth Capital application. Resulting scores are

64

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

part of the proposal evaluation process for each grant or loan program. The more smart
growth/smart energy oriented a community is, the more likely it is to receive funding. Since
2005, 315 out of 351 of the Commonwealth’s communities have applied at least once and
hundreds of new plans and regulations have improved municipal consistency with the Sustainable
Development Principles by 10 percent (the median score has risen from 63 to 76 out of a possible
140).54
GHG impact: Existing smart growth policies, including the Sustainable Development Principles,
are estimated to reduce GHG emissions by 0.1 percent in 2020. Recent studies3 have shown
integrated land use strategies can produce GHG reductions of between 2.7 percent and 4.4
percent from the baseline by 2050 depending on how aggressively the Commonwealth
implements smart growth policies and practices.
Other benefits: Development consistent with the principles would lower operational and capital
costs to government and society, improve energy conservation, better protect natural resources,
increase housing and transportation choice, lower housing and transportation costs, improve
public health, and enhance social and environmental justice.
Costs: There are predicted to be no incremental costs, as this policy simply requires more
consistent decision making, particularly regarding the investment of current state resources in
growth inducing infrastructure.
Equity issues: Smart growth increases affordability by reducing housing and transportation
costs. It enhances access to jobs and services for those who can’t/don’t drive and provides a
higher percentage of new jobs in urban areas where unemployment tends to be highest. Those
who want to build commercial/industrial projects or live in homes in places and patterns that are
inconsistent with the principles may pay more as these projects will no longer receive a state
subsidy.
Experience in other states: Many states have successfully used sustainable development or
smart growth principles to guide policies, programs, and investments.
Legal authority: The principles are presently implemented through an Executive Order. See
Smart Growth Package for possible expanded scope of funding subject to principles and
codification in legislation.
Implementation issues: Consistency of state policies, programs, and expenditures with the
principles is not universal, and consistency is not always a prominent consideration in the
decision making process.
Uncertainty: Calculating VMT and GHG benefits requires assumptions about how state policies,
programs, and particularly spending will change to conform to the principles, as well as how
dependent upon, or influenced by, state investments development is. Also, it is hard to predict
how communities and developers will respond to incentives and other policies that encourage
them to embrace the Sustainable Development Principles.

New Policy
GREENDOT
Policy summary: GreenDOT is the Massachusetts Department of Transportation’s sustainability
initiative, announced through a Policy Directive in June 2010 by the Secretary of Transportation.
The Commonwealth’s consultants, Cambridge Systematics, Inc., estimated that, if fully
implemented, GreenDOT could achieve 2.1 million tons of GHG reductions in 2020 and the
Secretary’s Directive adopts this level as its target.
GreenDOT is intended to fulfill the requirements of several state laws, regulations, Executive
Orders, and MassDOT policies, including the Global Warming Solutions Act, the Green
Communities Act, the Healthy Transportation Compact, and the ―Leading by Example‖ Executive
Order Number 484 by Governor Patrick. MassDOT will work closely with DEP and the Advisory
Group in determining the best regulatory and guidance framework for achieving the goals set
forth in the Policy. GreenDOT is focused on three related goals: reduce GHG emissions; promote
the healthy transportation modes of walking, bicycling, and public transit; and support for smart
growth development.
GreenDOT encompasses a number of different program areas, which are described briefly below:
statewide and regional long-range transportation planning, transportation project prioritization
and selection, ―complete streets‖ design guidelines, rail transportation, bicycle and pedestrian
transportation, promotion of eco-driving, sustainable design and construction, system operations,
facilities management, and travel demand management.
Transportation long-range planning and project prioritization and selection: Long-range
planning documents, including statewide planning documents (e.g. the Strategic Plan, State
Freight Plan, and MassDOT Capital Investment Plan), as well as the long-range Regional
Transportation Plans from the Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPO), must address
MassDOT’s three sustainability goals and plan for reducing GHG emissions over time. Similarly,
the shorter-range regional and state Transportation Improvement Programs (TIPs and STIP),
under which particular projects are chosen for funding in the coming four years, must be
consistent with the Commonwealth’s GHG reduction target. This will require that the MPOs and
MassDOT balance highway system expansion projects with other projects that support smart
growth development and promote public transit, walking and bicycling. In addition, the project
programming mix included in the RTPs, TIPs and STIP can contribute to GHG reduction through
prioritizing roadway projects that enable improved system operational efficiency, without
expanding overall roadway system capacity.
Over the long term, both long-range planning and project selection will affect where new
development in the Commonwealth is located and how that development is spatially configured.
These choices affect the degree to which future development represents ―smart growth,‖ or
clustered development patterns that facilitate walking, bicycling, riding public transit and driving
shorter distances, which would minimize the number of motor vehicle miles that people must
travel in order to go about their lives.
Project design and construction: The MassDOT Highway Division Project Development and
Design Guide requires that all projects must adhere to a ―complete streets‖ design approach,
meaning that new and redesigned roads must provide appropriate accommodation for all users,

66

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

including pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transit riders. These modes of transportation will also
be promoted by several other means. These include taking steps to see that more projects move
forward through the Transportation Enhancements Program, extending the Bay State Greenway,
improving accommodations for bicycles and pedestrians on bridges, and improving bicycle
parking facilities at MBTA stations.
Several efforts will continue to improve rail transportation in the state. The MBTA is striving to
both improve service on existing subway and commuter rail lines and to develop new service,
such as the Green Line Extension and the South Coast Rail Project. Other projects will improve
long-distance rail service for both passengers and freight.
MassDOT project design and construction will also reduce GHG impacts through such measures as
the use of recycled content in paving materials, use of warm mix asphalt paving, implementation
of stormwater remediation and use of best management practices, requirements for diesel engine
retrofits for construction contractor vehicles, and other measures.
Travel demand management and travel information: MassDOT will continue to promote and
deliver travel demand management (TDM) information and services, including ride-matching,
traveler information, real-time bus tracking, and other measures for the general public and
among MassDOT employees. MassDOT is currently working to implement a new ridematching/trip planning system to facilitate carpooling, vanpooling, and mode shifting from
automobile travel.
Eco-driving: Fuel efficiency can be improved greatly by maintaining vehicles properly, driving
within the speed limit, and accelerating more gently. The EPA estimates that ―smart driving‖ can
improve fuel efficiency by up to 33 percent, and EcoDriving USA estimates that Massachusetts’
drivers, with 5.4 million registered autos, could save about 4 million tons of CO₂ emissions
annually if eco-driving practices were followed. MassDOT will promote eco-driving through:
internal education for staff and contractors; external education of all Commonwealth drivers
through website content, RMV manual and testing content, signage, and brochures; and
development of a plan to improve tire inflation infrastructure.
System Operations: MassDOT, along with the MBTA and other regional transit authorities, will
take a variety of steps to minimize fuel use and GHG emissions from vehicles and facilities. This
includes retrofitting diesel buses with emission control devices, truck stop electrification, using
solar and wind power at MassDOT facilities and rights-of-way, improving energy efficiency in
MassDOT facilities, and increasing the share of low-emission transit vehicles in the MBTA fleet.
MassDOT will also facilitate more efficient roadway system operations; improvements that can
reduce GHG emissions by reducing congestion and time spent idling in traffic. MassDOT will do
this through the effective management of roadway capacity, using intelligent transportation
systems - which may include such measures as real-time traveler information and management
of traffic flow through improved traffic signal operations - ramp metering, and variable speed
limits. MassDOT will also continue to address roadway system ―bottlenecks,‖ or points of localized
capacity constraints, improvements that can reduce GHG emissions when traffic flow is improved
without expanding overall system capacity.

Expanded Policy
SMART GROWTH POLICY PACKAGE
Policy summary: Development patterns significantly influence vehicle miles traveled (VMT),
which could be substantially reduced by additional ―smart growth‖ that makes it easier for
households and businesses to decrease the number and distance of vehicle trips. Diffuse single
use development accessed by car results in 30 percent55 more VMT than compact mixed-use
growth. Massachusetts already has several policies promoting smart growth, but new,
complementary policies are necessary to achieve our smart growth targets. Such policies would
focus on influencing infrastructure investments by state agencies and planning decisions made by
local governments.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced in 2020

0.4 million metric tons; 0.4%

Motor fuel cost savings in 2020

$190 million

Jobs gained in 2020 (direct and indirect)

1,100 jobs

Clean energy economy impacts: Large transportation cost reductions can be expected for
residents and business due to reduced vehicle ownership and fuel consumption. High density
mixed-used development will increase building efficiency and make district energy and combined
heat and power more feasible.
Rationale: Development of forests and open spaces increases GHG emissions in two ways: lost
sequestration capacity and released carbon that had been stored in standing trees, and increased
VMT due to sprawl. The Patrick-Murray Administration’s historic commitment to land conservation
has permanently protected over 72,000 acres from development, preserving one of our most
valuable carbon sinks, and this initiative will continue into the future. Meanwhile, better land use
patterns will be important for reducing or eliminating projected VMT increases and realizing GHG
reductions from the transportation sector, which is expected to account for close to 40 percent of
total GHG emissions in Massachusetts in 2020, with light vehicles (cars, SUVs, minivans, pickups)
accounting for about 28 percent of the total. The Plan assumes that aggressive implementation of
current land use policies can result in a 0.4 million metric tons of GHG reduction in 2020, based
on getting 80 percent of new residential development to occur in mixed-use areas that are bike
and pedestrian friendly and higher than typical density. Strict adherence to and continued
enhancement of current policies, along with the implementation of new policies and programs will
be necessary to realize the 2020 and 2050 GHG targets.
Design issues: Existing state policies include (a) GreenDOT — which prioritizes transportation
projects that preserve the existing system, support denser ―smart growth‖ development, and
promote increased ridership, walking, and biking; (b) the MassWorks Infrastructure Program,
that provides a one-stop shop for infrastructure funds via six separate programs, and promotes
consistency with other state initiatives such as smart growth, Chapter 40R, and the 43D
Expedited Permitting Program; and (c) the South Coast Rail Executive Order, which supports the
South Coast Rail Economic Development and Land Use Plan by ensuring that agencies review

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

their policies, actions and investments to support and implement plan recommendations including
priority development and preservation areas. Complementary policies are needed in order to
achieve the 80 percent smart growth target. These are:
1. Reform state planning, subdivision, and zoning statutes — Pass the Land Use Partnership Act
or similar legislation that provides municipalities a better framework for planning and zoning,
enhanced tools to plan for and manage growth, and incentive to reduce VMT and GHG
emissions through better development.
2. Provide technical assistance and undertake a smart growth promotional campaign — Expand
efforts to help establish zoning and other land use regulations that reduce VMT. Provide direct
technical assistance by state employees, tools such as model zoning, and grants to hire
professional assistance. Also, use public appearances, the media, etc., to promote smart
growth by pointing out its many benefits.
3. Require state infrastructure spending to include smart growth development in the criteria for
funding decisions — State investments, particularly those in infrastructure and buildings,
influence where and how growth occurs. Enhanced use of these investments to promote
mixed-use, high-density development is critical to attainment of targeted VMT reductions
resulting from better land use. This could be accomplished either via Executive Order or
through legislation that codifies the Sustainable Development Principles and requires all
agencies permitting, building, or funding infrastructure projects to take into account a set of
smart growth criteria.
4. Significantly increase incentives to municipalities to plan and zone for development that
reduces VMT — Much as the Green Communities Program has succeeded in persuading many
communities to adopt desired practices - including the Stretch Code - strengthening existing
incentives and offering new ones can persuade communities to use their regulatory authority
in ways that reduce VMT. Enhance existing incentives such as Chapter 40R, Commonwealth
Capital, and the Growth District Initiative, and implement new ones such as ―Municipal
Challenge Grants‖ that recognize the GHG benefits of development practices that preserve
forest cover. Grants could be awarded to communities that institute an open space zoning
bylaw that protects 50 percent of a parcel as forest, limits lot clearance to one-third acre per
house, and requires best management practices for lot layout and tree preservation.
GHG impact: Existing policies will reduce GHG emissions by 0.23 percent in 202056 and
recommended enhancements will realize additional reductions. Recent studies57 have shown
integrated land use strategies can produce GHG reductions of between 2.7 percent and 4.4
percent from the baseline by 2050, depending on how aggressively the Commonwealth
implements smart growth policies and practices.
Equity issues: Smart growth increases affordability by reducing the amount households spend
on both housing and transportation. It further reduces housing costs by increasing the variety of
housing types available and decreasing the amount of land and infrastructure needed per housing
unit, and enhances access to jobs and services for the young and infirmed, as well as those
without a car. Finally, smart growth provides a higher percentage of new jobs in urban areas
where unemployment tends to be highest.

69

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Other benefits: Smart growth is as much as 70 percent cheaper for governments than the
same amount of sprawl. It simply costs less to provide infrastructure (streets, schools, sewers,
etc.) and services (like police and fire protection) to denser, more contiguous households than to
far-flung, low-density communities.58 Studies found that New Jersey and Rhode Island would
save $9.3 and $1.5 billion, respectively, over 20 years. 59 It enhances public health by reducing
air pollution and increasing physical activity, and enhances quality of life by improving
neighborhoods, reducing travels times, and lowering costs. This, in turn, enhances economic
competitiveness by appealing to prospective employees. Finally, it reduces development of open
space, including forested land that sequesters carbon.
Costs: Existing and proposed smart growth policies have little cost as they rely almost entirely
on enhanced use of existing funding. For example, state transportation funds should be shifted
toward investments in support of desired development, without increasing the amount expended.
Similarly, the financial incentives anticipate the use of existing state funding sources rather than
creation of new ones. Modest additional funds are needed for technical assistance to
municipalities and other entities to implement better zoning and other land use practices.
Experience in other states: Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and
others have implemented smart growth programs that have improved growth patterns and
thereby reduced VMT.
Legal authority: Legislation is needed to reform state planning, zoning and subdivision statutes
and to codify and require agencies to implement the Sustainable Development Principles. The
Commonwealth may also need to permit certain funding programs to implement municipal
incentives and to authorize additional funding for incentives and technical assistance.
Implementation issues: It will be important achieve high levels of cooperation from all
stakeholders, including development interests and local communities.
Uncertainty: Projected VMT and GHG reductions are taken from national level analyses and are
not Massachusetts-specific. While state investments in infrastructure and buildings will help to
steer growth to desirable locations and forms, developers can still finance their own projects and
build in ways that result in excessive VMT. In addition, it is hard to project how many
communities will take advantage of state incentives and whether growth will occur in these
communities rather than others zoned for sprawl.

with non-ozone depleters —
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and
perfluorocarbons (PFCs) — in a range of
applications including: insulating foams,
refrigeration and air-conditioning, fire
suppression, solvent cleaning, and
propellants used in aerosols. Unfortunately,
HFCs and PFCs are very potent GHGs. EPA
has determined that the use of these
chemicals comprises the most significant
portion of non-energy related industrial
emissions. This Plan will address emissions
from the use of these chemicals in light duty
motor vehicle air conditioning and
commercial and industrial refrigeration.

Non-Energy
Emissions
Greenhouse gas emissions from activites not
related to energy use represent a small but
important part of statewide GHG emissions.
Although these sources currently represent
only 7 percent of total emissions, many of
the gases emitted by these processes have a
high global warming potential (GWP),
thousands of times greater than CO2.
Furthermore, projections of future emissions,
including the Commonwealth’s 2020 BAU
scenario, show steady growth in industrial
emissions while emissions from most energyrelated sectors — transportation excepted —
are projected to level off or even decline.

For motor vehicle air conditioning,
Massachusetts will adopt the California Air
Resources Board (CARB) emissions
standards for new motor vehicles (see
Transportation). These standards will apply
to model year 2017 vehicles and beyond,
and include measures to both reduce leaks of
high GWP gases and require use of lower
GWP refrigerants. These measures are
estimated to remove 0.27 MMTCO2e in 2020.
For refrigerants in stationary commercial and
industrial equipment, the focus will be on
reducing leaks from, and finding
replacements for non-residential refrigeration
equipment with units containing at least 50
pounds of refrigerant. It will build on EPA’s
voluntary program for grocery stores — in
which many Massachusetts stores currently
participate. CARB’s November 2010
regulation phasing in leak detection and
repair requirements will serve as a model for
this program. The largest of these sources
will report their emissions under
Massachusetts GHG reporting rule and EPA’s
November 2010 mandatory reporting rule.
The total impact estimated for this program
is up to 1.18 MMTCO2e in 2020.

Specific industrial processes that emit
significant quantities of GHGs in
Massachusetts include: leakage of
refrigerant chemicals from commercial
equipment and motor vehicle air
conditioners, leakage of SF6 from electric
power transmission and distribution, and
combustion of plastics in solid waste
incinerators. The measures proposed in this
section of the Massachusetts Clean Energy
and Climate Plan for 2020 address these
sources of GHG emissions.

Reducing Emissions from Disposal of
Plastic Waste

This policy will reduce emissions of sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6) gas from leakage where it
is used to insulate switchgear in electricity
transmission and distribution systems. It will
build upon EPA’s current voluntary program
for SF6 reduction and could ultimately include
enforceable limits on leakage rates as well as
best management practices. CARB has
proposed a similar program. The impact of
this policy is up to 0.15 MMTCO2e reduction
by 2020.

Emissions associated with the combustion of
plastics that remain in our solid waste
streams can be minimized by greater
diversion of plastics to recycling. Plastic
recycling is already a priority in the
Commonwealth and results in other
environmental benefits, including the
reduction of toxics in the environment and
the growth of green jobs. This policy,
implemented through the Massachusetts
Solid Waste Master Plan, will aim to minimize
the volume of plastic going to disposal in the
Commonwealth, and instead divert these
materials to recycling. Plastic diversion
programs that include increasing assistance
to cities and towns, increasing producer
responsibility, and building markets for
recycled materials are estimated to reduce
GHG emissions by 0.3 MMTCO2e by 2020.

New Policy
REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS FROM MOTOR VEHICLE AIR CONDITIONING
Policy summary: The California Air Resources Board (CARB) is developing regulations to reduce
emissions associated with motor vehicle air conditioning (MVAC).60 Massachusetts General Law61
mandates that the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) adopt
CARB’s emission standards for new motor vehicles if they are more stringent than federal
standards. CARB’s standard aims to minimize emissions of high GWP refrigerants from MVAC
through the adoption of standards for new light-duty vehicles. These standards include measures
to reduce direct GHG emissions from MVAC systems, such as by using low GWP refrigerants and
reducing leaks, as well as measures to reduce indirect emissions of other pollutants through
improvement in the efficiency of the AC system (e.g., more efficient compressors, fans and
motors; systems that avoid over-chilling and reheating; and technologies to reduce heat gain in
the passenger cabin).
Annual benefits from improved motor vehicle air conditioning

Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

0.3 million metric tons CO2e; 0.3%

Net cumulative $ savings statewide 2018-2020

62

Net annual $ savings per vehicle

$50 - $130 million
$40 - $90

Clean energy economy impacts: Several of the measures aimed at reducing refrigerant
leakage and making MVAC more efficient also have a positive impact on fuel economy and can be
expected to reduce fuel costs for owners. Vehicle owners who pay less for fuel will have more
money to spend on other purchases — producing a positive ripple effect on the economy as a
whole, including the creation of in-state jobs. Reducing leakage may also reduce the frequency
with which vehicles need to be serviced for refrigerant recharge.
Rationale: Transportation is expected to account for close to 40 percent of total GHG emissions
in Massachusetts in 2020, and light vehicles by themselves (cars, SUVs, minivans, pickups) are
around 28 percent of the total. MVAC emissions account for about 9 percent of GHG emissions
from cars and light trucks. Air conditioning use is estimated to account for approximately 5.5
percent to 5.9 percent of vehicle fuel use in the US (although this figure is lower in
Massachusetts).
Design issues: CARB is developing draft regulations. After the California rules are finalized and
approved by EPA, MassDEP would adopt the CARB regulations if they are more stringent than
federal standards.
GHG Impact: 0.27 million metric ton reduction in CO2e in 2020. The policy applies to new
vehicles starting with model year 2017. Since the policy addresses emissions from new motor
vehicles, benefits will grow progressively as older vehicles are replaced in the active vehicle stock

(average of 10 years), with greater benefits after 2020 once the fleet has been fully replaced with
compliant vehicles.
Other benefits: Between 2018 and 2020, the policy is estimated to save vehicle owners $50
million to $130 million statewide, or $40 to $90 per vehicle per year. In addition, there will be
reductions in tailpipe emissions of non-GHG pollutants due to reduced fuel combustion, which will
benefit public health.
Costs: Estimated annual per-vehicle costs and savings from MVAC policy (2000$).

Equity issues: Incremental savings from the policy are expected to be distributed over all
classes of vehicles. However, initially the higher upfront vehicle purchase costs will affect higher
income drivers more, since lower income drivers tend to buy used cars. But lower income drivers
will enjoy the savings only after compliant vehicles become available in the used car market.
Experience in other states: Fourteen jurisdictions use CARB’s auto emission standards,
including Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Washington, D.C., and Bernalillo County,
New Mexico.
Legal authority: Massachusetts General Law Chapter 111, Section 142K mandates that
MassDEP adopt and implement CARB emission standards for new motor vehicles if such standards
are more stringent than federal standards.
Implementation issues: Because light-duty vehicle efficiency standards for 2011 through 2020
(CAFE and California’s vehicle GHG standards, both accounted for in existing policies) allow
manufacturers to meet the standards partly through voluntarily reducing MVAC emissions, this
policy discounted the benefits from MVAC emissions reductions. But manufacturers could choose
to voluntarily implement even greater MVAC reductions under CAFE than assumed here, which
would result in lower combined benefits of the efficiency and MVAC policies.
The policy calls for measures — in particular the switch to substitute refrigerants — that are still
in development. While there are strong incentives to develop and refine the necessary
technologies to meet existing requirements (e.g., EU regulations, other CA regulations), there is
still a risk that estimated reductions may not be achievable.
Uncertainty: At least one study has highlighted the risk that more stringent emissions
standards in selected states may reduce scrapping of used non-compliant cars and/or may result
in car manufacturers achieving reductions in adopting states while potentially allowing for larger
emissions and less efficient vehicles in other states. If so, these dynamics could reduce the
effectiveness of the policy in achieving the projected emissions reductions in the short run.

New Policy
STATIONARY EQUIPMENT REFRIGERANT MANAGEMENT
Policy summary: This policy aims to minimize emissions of high Global Warming Potential
refrigerants used in stationary non-residential equipment through:
facility registration, leak detection and monitoring, leak repair, system retrofit and retirement,
required service practices, and recordkeeping and reporting; and
eventual replacement of non-residential refrigeration equipment at the end of its life by
equipment using no-GWP or lower GWP substances, where such alternatives are available and
practicable.
The policy would affect facilities with refrigeration units containing at least 50 pounds of
refrigerant, beginning with a voluntary pilot program focused on leak detection and repair.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

1.2 million metric tons CO2e; 1.3%

Net annual $ savings statewide

$1.6 million

Cumulative $ savings statewide 2012-2020, discounted

63

$14 million

Clean energy economy impacts: Additional jobs in companies that engage in refrigeration
system leak detection and repair. Cost savings to affected facilities from lower use of chemicals
to refill systems.
Rationale: Common refrigerants include several types of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC). These
chemicals have global warming potentials up to 12,000 times more potent than CO2. Emissions
from this source category have been growing steadily since the 1990s, in part due to the
replacement with HFC of ozone depleting refrigerants targeted under the Montreal Protocol.
Design issues: California Air Resources Board (CARB) finalized a regulation64 effective
November 19, 2010, phasing in requirements for a leak detection and repair program for
refrigeration units containing a charge of 50 pounds of refrigerant or greater. Massachusetts
could implement a voluntary program that transitions into utilization of California’s regulations as
a model. Most of the businesses involved have been subject to similar EPA regulation on ozonedepleting chemicals used in refrigeration.
GHG impact: 1.2 million metric ton reduction in CO2e in 2020.
Implementation issues: Implementing a program to reduce refrigerant emissions requires
development of an inventory of facilities using large quantities of refrigerants. The number of
facilities can be estimated from the Economic Census 2007, 65 a profile of U.S. businesses
conducted every five years by the US Census Bureau. In addition, MassDEP will receive 2010
refrigerant emission data from large emitters by April 15, 2011, under the mandatory

Massachusetts GHG emissions reporting program. MassDEP has already established relationships
with larger supermarket store chains through efforts to encourage composting of food waste and
reduce use of disposable shopping bags.
A number of Massachusetts grocery stores participate in EPA’s voluntary ―GreenChill Advanced
Refrigeration Partnership,‖66 including Hannaford Bros., Price Chopper, Shaw’s Supermarkets, and
Whole Foods. In September 2009, a Star Market in Chestnut Hill became the first U.S. store
certified at the Platinum level under EPA’s GreenChill Store Certification program, while a Whole
Foods store in Dedham received Silver certification in August 2009. 67
On November 8, 2010, EPA signed final regulation 40 CFR 98 ―Mandatory Reporting of
Greenhouse Gases,‖ Subpart L ―Fluorinated Gas Production‖ and Subpart Q ―Importers and
Exporters of Fluorinated GHGs Inside Pre-charged Equipment or Closed-cell Foams,‖68 which
require manufacturers and importers of substances including high GWP refrigerants to report
GHG emissions, beginning with 2011 emissions reported by March 31, 2012.
Costs: Costs incurred by regulated entities pertaining to leak detection and repair can be divided
into technology costs (equipment upgrades to automatic leak detection), operation and
maintenance costs (leak detection, inspection, repair, annual program fee), and recordkeeping
costs (data management and reporting). CARB’s analysis of a similar policy indicates 2020
compliance costs ranging from $14 per facility with systems containing 50 to 200 pounds of
refrigerant, $30 per facility with systems containing up to 2,000 pounds, and savings of $8,700
per facility with systems containing 2,000 pounds or more (net savings for larger facilities, due to
economies of scale in reducing leakage).
CARB estimated savings of $2 per metric ton CO2e in the year 2020 after the proposed regulation
is fully implemented. This estimate may understate the actual net savings, since it does not
account for rising refrigerant prices, energy savings due to optimized system operation, or
benefits from mitigated climate impacts. Based on the number of facilities estimated to be
affected by the policy (about 2,000) and an estimated distribution of the facilities by size, the
policy is estimated to provide net savings of $1.6 million per year statewide.
Legal authority: MassDEP has authority to promulgate a regulation under Massachusetts
General Law Chapter 111, Section 142 to create an enforceable refrigerants control program to
prevent air pollution.
Uncertainty: Technical risks associated with leak detection and repair are expected to be
relatively small. The practices promoted by the policy are already established. Implementation
risks relate to the number and diversity of facilities that may be affected by the policy, which
could complicate compliance assistance, verification, and enforcement. The effectiveness of the
policy depends on facility owners actually implementing the practices called for in the policy,
which may in turn depend on ensuring that technicians are trained and aware of the requirement.

New Policy
REDUCING SF6 EMISSIONS FROM GAS-INSULATED SWITCHGEAR
Policy summary: Through a pilot program, followed by possible regulatory action, this policy
aims to minimize emissions of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from leakage of gas insulated switchgear
(GIS) used in electricity transmission and distribution systems by setting limits on leakage rates
(declining to 1 percent leakage allowed in 2020) and implementing best management practices
for the recovery and handling of SF6.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

0.2 million metric tons CO2e; 0.2%

Net cumulative $ costs statewide 2011-2020 (2008 $’s)

69

$0.9 - $1.5 million

Clean energy economy impacts: There would be an expected increase in in-state employment
for companies engaged in SF6 leak detection and repair and potential for technological innovation,
company formation, and jobs in solid-state (non-gas insulated) switch gear.
Rationale: SF6 is a GHG that is 23,900 times more potent than CO2 and has an atmospheric life
of 3,200 years. One pound of SF6 has the same global warming impact as 11 tons of CO2.
Approximately 80 percent of SF6 consumption and emissions are estimated to result from the
leakage and handling losses from GIS. Mitigation options for this equipment focus on reducing
leakage and handling losses. Best practices include SF 6 leak detection and repair, and recovery
and recycling.
Design issues: California Air Resources Board (CARB) has proposed a regulation70 requiring GIS
owners to reduce SF6 emissions from electrical equipment throughout California 1 percent per
year over a 10-year period. The initial allowed annual emission rate would be set at 10 percent of
the total amount of SF6 that could leak; with the allowed annual rate declining to 1 percent in
2020. Massachusetts could use CARB’s regulations as a model.
A number of Massachusetts utilities participate in EPA’s voluntary ―SF 6 Emission Reduction
Partnership for Electric Power Systems,‖71 including: National Grid, NSTAR, and Western
Massachusetts Electric Company. EPA does not publish any state- or utility-specific data from its
voluntary program. On November 8, 2010, EPA signed final regulation 40 CFR 98 ―Mandatory
Reporting of Greenhouse Gases,‖ Subpart DD ―Use of electric transmission and distribution
equipment,‖72 which requires reporting emissions from GIS, beginning with 2011 emissions
reported by March 31, 2012.
As part of its development of a SF6 emissions reduction program, CARB distributed a survey 73
requesting information from stakeholders on SF 6 emissions from the electricity sector ―to

determine SF6 GHG emission reduction potential and to assist ARB staff in developing appropriate
control strategies.‖ After consideration of any 2010 SF 6 emission data MassDEP receives by April
15, 2011 as part of the first mandatory Massachusetts SF 6 emission data reporting, MassDEP
could consider whether a survey similar to CARB’s would provide useful information for designing
a regulation.
GHG impact: 0.15 million metric ton reduction in CO2e in 2020.
Costs: According to CARB’s analysis of a similar policy, the expense of compliance ranges from
savings of $1/metric ton CO2e (in the case of SF6 recycling) to a cost of $55/metric ton CO2e (in
the case of GIS repair and replacement), depending on the measure necessary to meet the
emission limits in any given year. Entities are assumed to use the cheapest methods first and
progressively move to more expensive methods to achieve further reductions. Some entities may
not incur a cost for reducing SF6 emissions for some or all years to 2020, if their leak rates fall
below a year’s allowed limit. CARB estimates the cost effectiveness of the policy at about $18 per
metric ton CO2e reduced in the later years of the policy when the allowed leakage rate has
declined to 1 percent. Similar cost effectiveness may be achieved in Massachusetts if the baseline
practices and electric infrastructure profiles are comparable.
Equity issues: Full implementation of this policy may impose additional compliance costs on
utilities, which could be passed on to customers — although that additional cost would be
miniscule. CARB’s analysis of the proposed regulation estimated the incremental cost that could
be passed on to electricity ratepayers at $0.000016 to $0.000025 per kilowatt-hour as a result of
the policy. This represents an increase of less than 0.02 percent relative to average residential
electricity rates in Massachusetts, or about 1.5 cents for the average monthly residential
electricity bill.
Legal authority: MassDEP would need to promulgate a regulation to create an enforceable SF 6
control program. MassDEP presently has the authority to regulate such air pollutants under
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 111, Section 142; and it’s authority over GHG emissions is
amplified by the Global Warming Solutions Act.
Implementation issues and uncertainty: The policy promotes greater implementation of
current industry best practices that are generally low-cost. The maximum emission rate set in
California by CARB for the early years is already being achieved by Massachusetts utilities that
have taken voluntary measures to reduce their emissions. Achieving the 1 percent limit in later
years may require the use of relatively more expensive measures but these measures already
exist.

REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS FROM PLASTICS
Policy summary: Solid waste is generated by residences and businesses across Massachusetts.
Diverting high-carbon-content materials, such as plastics, from the waste stream can reduce
emissions released after materials are discarded, and for some part of the waste stream,
incinerated. These diverted materials can then be recycled into other products. Diverting plastics
from the waste stream under this Plan will result in materials with a lower carbon content being
combusted at Massachusetts municipal waste–to-energy facilities, reducing emissions of CO2.
Looking only at in-state emissions reductions, MassDEP conservatively estimates the reduction
potential from diverting a portion of plastics from solid waste disposal in 2020 at 0.3 million
metric tons of CO2e per year.
Economy-wide GHG emissions reduced 2020

0.30 million metric tons CO2e; 0.3%

Annual $ savings statewide in 2020

$8 to $11 million

Cumulative $ savings statewide 2009-2020

74

$69 to $92 million

Clean energy economy impacts: Recycling yields greater local employment than does waste
combustion. Currently, industries associated with recycling support 14,000 jobs in Massachusetts,
and increased recycling of plastics would spur growth.
Rationale: The Commonwealth periodically prepares a Solid Waste Master Plan in accordance
with Massachusetts General Law Chapter 16 Section 21. The solid waste sector includes sources
of GHG emissions, such as landfills and municipal waste combustors, and plastics constitute a
significant portion of the emissions. As detailed in a press release 75 that accompanied release of
the most recent Draft Solid Waste Master Plan, ―…The main objectives of the draft master plan
include maximizing recycling, improving the environmental performance of solid waste facilities
and developing integrated solid waste management systems. The draft master plan calls for a
dramatic increase in residential, business and institutional recycling and composting, with an
emphasis on paper and organics recycling…‖.
GHG impact: 0.3 million metric ton reduction in CO2e in 2020.
Costs: According to the Draft Solid Waste Master Plan: ―Diverting material from disposal,
whether through upfront waste reduction, reuse, recycling or composting, can save significant
disposal costs. Current disposal fees in Massachusetts typically range from $60 to $80 per ton. If
we are able to achieve our goal of reducing disposal by 2 million tons per year by 2020, that
would result in annual avoided disposal costs of $120-$160 million. Plastics diversion alone
constitutes some $8 million to $11 million of the total $120 million to $160 million in annual
avoided disposal costs.
Implementation issues: Public hearings have been held on the Commonwealth's Draft 20102020 Solid Waste Master Plan: A Pathway to Zero Waste.76 All public comments have been
received and are being reviewed.

II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Several policies do not fit neatly into the
categories of buildings, electricity supply,
transportation or non-energy emissions.
These are state actions that drive clean
energy adoption across all of these domains.

This necessarily includes the buildings,
energy supply, and transportation impacts of
a project. The state’s Leading By Example
program, established by Governor Patrick,
requires state agencies to reduce energy
costs and lower emissions in state buildings,
in vehicle fleets, and through green
procurement. The Green Communities
Division of DOER works closely with
municipalities to help cities and towns lower
their energy costs and adopt energy efficient
technologies, add renewables to their energy
mix, and make their fleets more fuel
efficient. Though not, for the purposes of the
Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate
Plan for 2020, discrete policies with their
own measurable impacts on GHG emissions,
they contribute to (and their impacts are
accounted for within) numerous other
initiatives contained in this Plan.

The Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act
(MEPA) Office, which conducts the
environmental review process for all large
development projects, requires proponents
to assess the environmental impact of a
project and analyze alternatives in an effort
to avoid, minimize and mitigate damage.

Finally, the Global Warming Solutions Act
itself requires all state agencies,
departments, boards, commissions and
authorities to consider climate change
impacts, such as GHG emissions, when they
issue permits, licenses and other
administrative approvals.

Policies
Introduction

80

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Expanded Policy
MEPA GHG POLICY AND PROTOCOL
Policy summary: MEPA requires that all major projects proposed in the Commonwealth that
have state involvement (in the form of state permits, land transfers or financial assistance, for
example) undertake an assessment of project impacts and alternatives in an effort to avoid,
minimize and mitigate damage to the environment to the maximum extent feasible. Building on
this general requirement, the MEPA GHG Policy requires that certain projects undergoing review
by the MEPA office quantify their GHG emissions and identify measures to avoid, minimize, and
mitigate such emissions. In addition to quantifying project-related GHG emissions, the MEPA GHG
Policy also requires proponents to evaluate project alternatives that may result in lower GHG
emissions and to quantify the impact of proposed mitigation in terms of emissions and energy
savings. The MEPA GHG Policy is primarily applied to commercial and residential real estate
development projects, but also applies to industrial and energy generation projects.
Clean energy economy impacts: By requiring project proponents to evaluate all feasible
measures to reduce their GHG emissions, such as energy efficiency upgrades, fuel switching,
incorporation of renewable energy measures and reduction of vehicle miles traveled, the MEPA
GHG Policy supports the development of industries and jobs to supply these technologies. In
addition, the avoided fuel and electricity use due to enhanced efficiency of projects cuts the longterm operational costs of the projects.
Rationale: The principal purpose of the MEPA GHG Policy is to require project proponents to
undertake a thorough analysis of a proposed project’s primary sources of GHG emissions at an
early stage of project planning and to examine all feasible alternatives that may have lower GHG
emissions potential. By conducting this early-stage impacts and alternatives analysis, project
proponents can integrate directly into project planning sustainable design considerations that will
allow the project to achieve GHG emissions reductions in the most economical manner.
Policy design and issues: For the majority of projects subject to the MEPA GHG Policy, the
Policy requires comparison of emissions associated with the proposed project design to the
emissions that would result from construction of an identical building code-compliant project. In
this way, the MEPA GHG Policy is closely related to issues surrounding the adoption of Advanced
Building Energy Codes and other energy efficiency improvements for buildings. Similarly, where
the MEPA GHG Policy encourages adoption of renewable energy components, it is closely related
to issues involved in the implementation of incentives for generating renewable energy. The
MEPA GHG Policy also aims to reduce vehicle miles traveled in coordination with other state
policies.
GHG impact: To date, more than 90 projects have been at least partially reviewed in
accordance with the MEPA GHG policy, and 32 projects have completed MEPA review with a
finding that their GHG analysis adequately complied with the MEPA GHG Policy. Projects that have
completed review have achieved an average reduction of 19.5 percent in stationary-source GHGs
below an equivalent code-compliant project. Mobile source GHG reductions have ranged from
zero to 25 percent, with an average of 5.8 percent. In total, the MEPA GHG Policy has resulted in
commitments to reduce GHG emissions by over 70,000 tons per year to date. However, it is likely
that a portion of these reductions, and many of the potential future reductions under the MEPA

81

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Policy, may be duplicative of the reductions achieved by other state policies designed to increase
efficiency, encourage renewable energy generation, and reduce vehicle miles traveled.
Costs: The upfront costs of incorporating GHG reduction measures will vary widely depending
upon the project. Because the MEPA GHG Policy does not mandate a specified level of reductions,
but rather asks project proponents to adopt ―feasible‖ measures, measures that are considered
infeasible from a cost perspective are eliminated from consideration.
Experience in other states: The MEPA GHG Policy is a nation-leading policy. Other states,
including California and New York, have adopted similar policies, and the White House Council on
Environmental Quality, which oversees implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA) by federal agencies, has also released a draft policy concerning consideration of GHG
emissions as part of the NEPA review of individual projects.
Legal authority: The Global Warming Solutions Act specifically amended the MEPA statute to
provide that:
In considering and issuing permits, licenses and other administrative approvals and decisions, the
respective agency, department, board, commission or authority shall also consider reasonably
foreseeable climate change impacts, including additional GHG emissions, and effects, such as
predicted sea level rise. See M.G.L. c. 30, §61.
Therefore, implementation of the MEPA GHG Policy is mandatory under the MEPA statute.
Implementation issues: The MEPA GHG Policy has become a routine part of the environmental
impact review process. For real estate development projects, the assessment and review of a
project’s GHG analysis has become generally accepted by the regulated industry and the public.

Expanded Policy
LEADING BY EXAMPLE
Policy summary: The Leading by Example (LBE) Program, established in April 2007 by Governor
Patrick’s Executive Order (EO) No. 484, works to lower costs and reduce environmental impacts
at all Executive Branch agencies, as well as the 29 public institutions of higher education and
several quasi-public authorities. The program oversees efforts to reduce energy use at the state’s
70 million square feet of buildings and fuel use among the thousands of light and heavy duty
vehicles, expand recycling programs, reduce water consumption, promote environmentally
preferable purchasing, facilitate the construction of high performance state buildings, and reduce
carbon emissions across state government. EO 484 sets the following targets for state government: 25 percent reduction from a 2002 baseline in GHG emissions by 2012, 40 percent by 2020,
and 80 percent by 2050; 20 percent reduction from a 2004 baseline in energy use intensity by
2012 and 35 percent by 2020; and an increase in consumption of renewable electricity to 15
percent of total electric use by 2012 and 30 percent by 2020. The EO also established a ―Massachusetts LEED Plus‖ building standard for new construction and major renovation projects that
requires all state government projects to achieve LEED certification and perform 20 percent
better than the Massachusetts energy code.
The LBE Program is overseen by EEA and Administration and Finance, working collaboratively
with state agencies such as the DOER (clean energy policies and project implementation),
Division of Capital Asset Management (construction and energy projects) and Operational
Services Division (procurement) to track state government energy use and GHG emissions,
oversee the funding and implementation of dozens of clean energy projects annually, and provide
technical assistance and training for dozens of agencies and hundreds of staff each year.
Despite the advances made by the LBE program, there is currently no single entity charged with
managing and procuring low-cost, clean energy across all public agencies, authorities, and
facilities. The Administration has proposed and will continue to work toward the development of a
Common-wealth Energy Solutions program, which will end the separate decision-making by
multiple agencies and provide an opportunity for a comprehensive, integrated strategy from
procurement (taking advantage of economies of scale) to continuous monitoring and
management of energy performance.
Clean energy economy impacts: Leading by Example efforts that include broad and comprehensive energy efficiency projects, as well as small and large-scale renewable project installations, will continue to create significant numbers of clean energy jobs in the construction and retrofit markets. Additionally, these efforts will result in a stabilization and potential reduction of
state government energy costs, and will continue to reduce the amount of foreign oil used in
public buildings.
Rationale: With approximately 70 million square feet of buildings, state government operations
result in significant amounts of fuel consumption annually, including approximately 900 million
kWh of electricity, 50 million therms of natural gas, 15 million gallons of fuel oil and more than
million gallons of diesel fuel and gasoline. This consumption results in over 800,000 tons of GHG
emissions and expenditures exceeding $220 million. Given this large impact, there is clearly a
huge opportunity to reduce energy usage and associated carbon emissions. Such efforts will also
demonstrate to other institutions and the private sector that large-scale energy reduction and
renewable energy efforts are both feasible and fiscally desirable.

83

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

Design issues: Although significant clean energy programs are underway at state facilities, efforts to sustain such programs at the current scale once federal stimulus dollars are no longer
present are needed. Also, efforts to streamline and simplify bidding and construction timelines
have taken place, but more work will most likely be needed to ensure that projects are undertaken and completed in a timely fashion.
GHG impact: GHG emission impacts are directly related to energy reduction and renewable
energy efforts at state facilities. If the 2012 targets in EO 484 are met, this would result in a
reduction of approximately 200,000 metric tons of GHGs.
Other benefits: Additional benefits include reduced energy costs for Massachusetts taxpayers.
The installation of new equipment also minimizes facility maintenance costs and needs, and
improves comfort for the thousands of employees, residents, and visitors who work or live in, or
visit, state facilities. LBE projects also provide important piloting for new technologies and system
manage-ment initiatives that could be adopted by other institutions and cities and town, as well
as the private sector.
Costs: Although exact costs are unknown, it is anticipated that over $200 million worth of clean
energy projects will be implemented by 2012. Project costs will, for the most part, be funded
through the Massachusetts Clean Energy Investment Program (CEIP), a newly developed
program that is designed to provide low-rate bond financing paid for out of project savings. This
program results in a positive cash flow early in the project and overall simple paybacks of between 10 and 20 years. Additional financing through 2012 and thereafter will be targeted through
3rd party financing, forward capacity market payments, Renewable Energy Credits, utility
incentives, and, where available, renewable energy rebates.
Equity issues: There are no known equity issues.
Experience in other states: Many other states have undertaken ―leading by example‖ efforts,
including California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New York, North California, Pennsylvania, and
Utah. Success has varied, but all efforts recognize the impact to the state budget of reducing
energy costs, as well as how such efforts are critical to the success of statewide clean energy
goals, where applicable.
Legal authority: EO 484 provides the legal authority to those entities overseen by the Governor.
Other independent entities, such as the MWRA, MassPort, and the Massachusetts Convention
Center Authority, frequently participate on a voluntary basis in the LBE Program and undertake
similar efforts, but they are not subject to the specific targets in the order.
Implementation issues: Successful implementation is dependent upon state resources,
including financial and staffing. LBE staff will continue to work with key agencies, in particular the
Division of Capital Asset Management and Executive Office for Administration and Finance, to ensure that such resources are available.
Uncertainty: Given the success of past efforts, current use of federal ARRA funding, and the
ongoing collaboration between key agencies, it is likely that a significant number of clean energy
projects will be initiated and completed over the next several years. However, meeting the energy
and GHG emission reduction targets will depend on the extent to which energy reductions are
sufficient to overcome new construction and expansion of services — particularly at the public
institutions of higher education, which have seen a significant increase in enrollment and hours of
operation. Additionally, ensuring that adequate funding exists to implement large-scale projects is
critical to meeting the targets.

Existing Policy
GREEN COMMUNITIES DIVISION
Policy summary: Created by the Green Communities Act of 2008, the Green Communities
Division of the DOER is intended to help municipalities become more sustainable, control rising
energy costs, and incubate the clean energy technologies and practices that will put
Massachusetts cities and towns — and the Commonwealth as a whole — at the center of the 21st
century clean energy economy. Envisioned as a way to encourage municipalities to make greener
energy decisions, the Division is mandated to offer grant and loan opportunities to municipalities
in order to be designated as ―Green Communities.‖
Clean energy economy impacts: The five required criteria to be designated a Green
Community help municipal governments to reduce their own energy costs, and those of local
residents and businesses; and help to achieve siting of wind, solar, and other renewable energy
installations.
Rationale: Municipal governments are substantial consumers of fossil-fuel energy, primarily for
buildings and secondarily from vehicles. The Energy Reduction Plan along with the Fuel Efficient
Vehicle Policy required for designation as a Green Community results in municipalities reducing
their energy consumption from municipal operations by a minimum of 20 percent. Through
zoning they can have a major impact on the ability of renewable energy facilities to find suitable
locations. And by deciding to adopt the ―stretch‖ energy code (see Buildings) — another
requirement for Green Communities designation — they significantly improve the energy
efficiency of new construction and major renovations.
Policy design and issues: The Division provides technical assistance to communities to help
them qualify for Green Community designation and state grants. To become Green Communities,
municipalities must meet five criteria:
Adopt a local zoning bylaw or ordinance that allows "as-of-right-siting" of renewable and/or
alternative energy R&D facilities, manufacturing facilities or generation units;
Adopt an expedited permitting process related to the as-of-right facilities;
Establish a municipal energy use baseline and establishing a program designed to reduce use
by 20 percent within five years;
Purchase only fuel-efficient vehicles for municipal use, whenever such vehicles are
commercially available and practicable; and
Require all new residential construction over 3,000 square feet and all new commercial and
industrial real estate construction to reduce lifecycle energy costs (such as adoption the
Stretch Code).
The Green Communities Act allows funding of up to $10 million per year for the designation and
grant program from the proceeds of Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) allowance
auctions and other sources. The Green Communities Division also serves all Massachusetts cities
and towns as a one-stop shop for energy efficiency and renewable energy opportunities, helping
them understand all the state programs at their disposal and providing streamlined delivery of
those programs.

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
II. An Integrated Portfolio of Policies

To achieve the goal of serving all 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, the Green Communities
Division offers a number of programs and services in addition to its signature Green Communities
Grant Program. Other services include an energy assessment program in collaboration with the
investor-owned utilities, technical assistance with energy savings performance contracting,
stimulus grant programs and support, an online energy information system for tracking energy
consumption and making decisions about how to reduce consumption, webinars and guidance
documents and tools, a website and listserv for disseminating information and four Regional
Coordinators to provide direct support to cities and towns.
GHG impact: GHG emissions are directly related to energy reduction and renewable energy
efforts in municipalities. The first 35 Green Communities committed to reducing their energy
consumption by 822,000 MMBTUs in five years. The newest 18 committed to a reduction of
592,000 MMBTUs over five years.
Other benefits: Additional benefits include reduced energy costs and a lower burden on
Massachusetts taxpayers. Projects funded through the Green Communities Division can pilot new
technologies and system management. In addition, the work done by municipalities to become
designated as a Green Community requires buy-in of its residents, with meeting many of the
criteria requiring a Town Meeting vote. This has resulted in a major grassroots movement to
educate the larger citizenry on the benefits of reducing energy consumption and creating clean,
renewable energy projects.
Costs: Up to $10 million per year, funded through the proceeds of Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI) emissions allowance auctions (see Electricity) and other sources.
Equity issues: There are no known equity issues. G grants are based on a $125,000 base for
each designated Green Community, plus additional amounts tied to per capita income and
population, and for municipalities that provide as-of-right siting for renewable energy generation.
There are 53 designated communities from the Berkshires to Cape Cod, ranging in population
from 990 to 621,000 residents.
Experience in other states: We are aware of no similar programs in other states. The Green
Communities Division is believed to be the first of its kind in the nation.
Legal authority: The Green Communities Act of 2008 created the Division and the designation
and grant program and authorized funding for it. The Board of Building Regulation and Standards
approved the Stretch Code as an option for municipalities to adopt.
Implementation issues: As of December 2010, 53 communities had attained designation as
Green Communities, thereby qualifying for funding from the Division. In addition, as of December
2010, 64 cities and towns had passed the Stretch Code.
Uncertainty: The Green Communities Division and Grant program are new and have created
considerable excitement among Massachusetts cities and towns. It will be important in going
forward to continue engaging municipalities in a manner that maintains that excitement. In
addition, proceeds from the RGGI auctions, the main source of funding for the Division, are
difficult to predict.

New Policy

CONSIDERATION OF GHG EMISSIONS IN STATE PERMITTING, LICENSING &
ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVALS
Policy Summary and Rationale: Section 7 of the Global Warming Solutions Act states, ―In
considering and issuing permits, licenses and other administrative approvals and decisions, the
respective agency, department, board, commission or authority shall also consider reasonably
foreseeable climate change impacts, including additional GHG emissions...‖ in the context of
environmental review. The body of landmark energy legislation that has been passed in the last
four years established new expectations for how we manage energy, plan transportation, build
our buildings, and generate and distribute electricity. The official approvals by state agencies,
departments, boards, commissions and authorities often have implications for clean energy
adoption and GHG emissions. EEA, in collaboration with other state and quasi-public agencies,
will develop a plan to implement this requirement in selected agency actions.

Economic Development (EOHED). This team
spearheaded the technical analysis.
Overseen by this state agency technical
working group, most of the analytical work
was undertaken by a team of consultants,
led by Eastern Research Group (ERG) and
including several other firms with extensive
expertise in specific sectors — Cambridge
Systematics, Inc. on transportation, Synapse
Energy Economics on electricity supply and
energy use in buildings, and Abt Associates
on the non-energy emissions sources. A
variety of specialized models and data
sources were used by the consultants for the
various sector analyses. All the supporting
data was then entered into the LEAP (longrange energy alternatives planning) model of
Stockholm Environment Institute–U.S.,
another member of our consulting team.
LEAP provides a convenient and
sophisticated tool for integrating all the
sectors and for running various policy
scenarios. It was used both for the 2020
analysis and for development of hypothetical
scenarios to reach the long-range 2050
reduction mandate. Finally, additional
analysis of scenarios for shifting the motor
vehicle fleet to lower-carbon alternatives to
petroleum fuel was conducted by Ventana
Associates, using system dynamics
modeling.

Section 4. (a) The secretary shall adopt the
2020 statewide GHG emissions…which shall
be between 10 per cent and 25 per cent
below the 1990 emissions level … (Global
Warming Solutions Act of 2008; M.G.L.
Chapter 21N)
Setting the statewide GHG emissions limit for
2020 was based on two years of analysis and
public comment, and followed a process set
forth in the Act.
In March 2009, the Executive Office of
Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA)
established the Climate Protection and Green
Economy Advisory Committee to provide
input on the 2020 limit and measures to
reduce GHG emissions in accordance with
the Global Warming Solutions Act (GWSA).
As required by the GWSA, the Advisory
Committee included members representing
the following sectors: commercial, industrial
and manufacturing; transportation; lowincome consumers; energy generation and
distribution; environmental protection;
energy efficiency and renewable energy;
local government; and academic institutions.
Advisory committee meetings were held
throughout 2009 and 2010 and
subcommittees were set up to examine
technical aspects of possible policies.

The first step in the analysis was to
determine what Massachusetts 1990
emissions level was and what the predicted
―Business as Usual‖ (BAU) emissions
trajectory to 2020 would be. MassDEP issued
its Statewide Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Level: 1990 Baseline and 2020 BAU

In parallel and integrated with the activities
of the Advisory Committee, EEA convened a
technical working group consisting of staff
from EEA, the Department of Environmental
Protection (MassDEP), the DOER, the
Department of Transportation (MassDOT),
and the Executive Office of Housing and

88

77

Biofuels Act, various state government
executive actions, and the federal
government would result in emissions being
reduced to approximately 18 percent below
1990 levels by 2020 — roughly the midpoint
of the 10 percent to 25 percent range
required by the GWSA.

Projection on July 1, 2009. The primary
finding of this report was that, despite yearto-year variation, the trend line of GHG
emissions has been relatively stable since
1990 and is predicted to remain relatively
stable through 2020. Even though there has
been robust economic growth in
Massachusetts since 1990, GHG emissions
have remained stable because the fuel mix in
electricity generation shifted toward natural
gas (which is less carbon-intensive than coal
or oil), the Massachusetts economy shifted
toward services, and the limited energy
efficiency programs in place during that
period moderated growth in energy use. The
BAU estimate for 2020 is essentially a
straight-line extrapolation of the 1990-2008
stable trend. This approach was chosen
because the 1990-2008 period included both
recessions and economic booms, and the
underlying trends of that period are likely to
continue, whereas attempts to create a more
dynamic model of GHG trends in the future
would unavoidably involve making a wide
range of untested assumptions.

Following that report, EEA issued a Draft
Climate Implementation Plan: A framework
for meeting the 2020 and 2050 goals of the
Global Warming Solutions Act. In the
Implementation Plan, Secretary Bowles
signaled his intention to set a 2020
emissions reduction requirement of 18
percent to 25 percent below 1990 levels and,
for the final plan to achieve this limit, to give
greatest consideration to those measures
that show potential for significant energy
cost savings and/or job creation.
In May 2010, Eastern Research Group
submitted an additional report, CostEffective Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in
Massachusetts: An Analysis of 2020
Potential. For this report, the consultants
were asked to consider what additional GHG
reductions would be technically feasible with
cost-effective policies beyond those already
in place. This report showed that it would be
technically feasible to reduce emissions by
up to 35 percent below 1990 levels by 2020
with additional policies that are costeffective.

The next step in the analysis was to
determine the expected GHG reductions by
2020 that would result from the policies and
programs implemented or initiated since the
beginning of the Patrick-Murray
Administration, not including new policies
that would be implemented under authority
of the GWSA. In April 2010, Eastern
Research Group submitted a report to the
Advisory Committee, Initial Estimates of
Emissions Reductions from Existing Policies
Related to Reducing Greenhouse Gas
Emissions. This report found that the energy
efficiency, renewable energy, and
transportation measures required by the
Green Communities Act, the Advanced

Both the draft implementation plan and the
analysis of 2020 potential were used to focus
a series of eight public hearings that were
held in June 2010, as required by the Act.
Nearly 200 individuals and organizations
provided oral or written comment on the
2020 emissions reduction requirement and
on policy measures to meet the requirement.
The vast majority of commenters called for
the Secretary to set the GHG limit at 25
percent below 1990 levels, the maximum
allowed under the statute. A range of
suggestions also pointed to a variety of

different policy mechanisms that EEA should
analyze in preparing the final implementation
plan.

Following the hearings, EEA further consulted
with the Climate Protection and Green
Economy Advisory Committee and tasked the
Advisory Committee’s technical
subcommittees, technical staff at EEA
agencies, MassDOT, EOHED and other state
agencies, and third-party consultants with
analyzing a wide range of actions, policies,
regulations, and legislation that could
achieve additional clean energy gains and
emissions reduction by 2020 and beyond.
The Secretary then directed the technical
teams to conduct in-depth analyses of those
additional measures that satisfy criteria of
cost-effectiveness while reducing GHG
emissions. These in-depth analyses focused
on GHG reduction potential; cost; clean
energy economy impacts (cost of living,
number and quality of jobs, reduced
spending on fuel imports, etc.);
implementation and design issues;
experience in other states or jurisdictions;
other co-benefits; equity issues; and
uncertainties.

policies incorporated in the Massachusetts
Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020, and
the associated potential contribution to GHG
reduction below 1990 levels by 2020 for

which include measures put in place since
2007 and new initiatives proposed in this
Plan, are projected to achieve emissions
reductions in the range of 18 percent to 33
percent by 2020 (see Figure 8). The lower
end of this range represents a scenario in
which Business as Usual (BAU) emissions are
higher than projected and actual emission
reductions from the policies as implemented
are at the low end of estimates. The higher
end of the range represents a scenario in
which BAU emissions are lower than
projected and implementation success is
relatively high. A mid-range estimate for the
portfolio of policies results in GHG emissions
approximately 27 percent below 1990 levels
by 2020.

27 percent below 1990 levels by 2020.

In setting this limit, the Secretary took into
account the statutory mandate of 80 percent
reduction by 2050, which led him to set the
2020 limit as high as is practical. He also did
so based on his understanding that the
portfolio of measures outlined in the
Integrated Portfolio section of this Plan,
discounted for uncertainty and potential
implementation constraints, provides enough
flexibility and redundancy for the
Commonwealth to achieve the 2020
reduction limit of 25 percent.

Based on these analyses, input from the
Advisory Committee, and full consideration
of the public comments received, EEA
Secretary Ian Bowles determined that a
responsible and achievable GHG emissions
reduction limit for 2020 that maximizes
opportunities to realize energy cost savings,
increase energy independence, and promote
growth in clean energy jobs in Massachusetts
is 25 percent — the high end of the range for
2020 authorized by GWSA, but the middle of
the range of possible outcomes for the
policies incorporated in this Plan.

III. Implementing the Global Warming Solutions Act

Putting the Plan
into Action

Engaging Citizens to Realize our Clean
Energy Future: Individuals, Cities & Towns,
and Regional Planning Agencies

In 2011, state agencies responsible for each
new measure will complete program
development and consultative processes with
stakeholders, in order to create an
implementation plan for each policy outlined
in this Plan. Given the portfolio nature of the
policies included in the Plan, there will
naturally be a diversity of processes to move
each policy forward. For example, some
require pilot programs (such as the Pay As
You Drive pilot program that is dependent on
Federal Highway funding). Others require
expansion of existing programs (such as
energy efficiency). Still others may require
legislation even as administrative actions
move them forward (such as the expansion
of renewable energy credits from electricity
to include thermal energy).

Throughout the development of this Plan,
there has been ongoing interest on the part
of the Advisory Committee and the public
concerning the need for continued citizen
engagement in reaching the clean energy
and climate goals set forth in the Global
Warming Solution Act.
During the course of eight public hearings
held across the state and in written
comments, EEA learned of many projects
and activities that Massachusetts citizens,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
universities, business groups, and
municipalities are engaged in to reduce GHG
emissions and work toward a clean energy
future. EEA and the Commonwealth’s
agencies recognize the value of these efforts
and commit to work together and support
them as we collectively strive to implement
this Plan.

As part of continued policy development,
more detailed cost and benefit information
will be analyzed and used to design
programs to maximize a cost-effective
transition to an equitable clean energy
future, which includes well-distributed green
jobs and business growth, as well as GHG
gas reduction.

Individuals are already making clean energy
decisions such as making their homes more
energy efficient, and are eager for
information about how they can do so where
they work, shop and play.
As of December 2010, 53 communities had
attained designation as Green Communities,
becoming eligible for funding to go greener
as a result; and 64 communities have
adopted the ―stretch code,‖ a local-option
building code that sets a standard of 20
percent to 30 percent more energy efficient
than the Commonwealth’s recently adopted
statewide code. Earlier this year, the city of
Boston adopted a wide-ranging climate
action plan that was developed through
extensive community engagement. In
addition, a variety of independent climate
and energy initiatives at the municipal level
are developing practices and information that
state agencies can learn from and support.

In order to monitor progress in implementing
the Plan, the Climate Protection and Green
Economy Advisory Committee will remain in
existence, and the Secretary of EEA will
present an annual progress report to the
Committee by December 31 of each year. In
preparation for that annual report, all
responsible agencies (EEA agencies,
MassDOT, EOHED, and others) will report to
the EEA Secretary by October 31 of each
year on their progress toward
implementation. The Secretary will, in turn,
compile a complete report for the Climate
Protection and Green Economy Advisory
Committee. The first full progress review
required by the Act will be in 2015.

93

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
III. Implementing the Global Warming Solutions Act

Regional planning organizations, in
particular, are valuable partners for the state
to work with in crafting solutions tailored to
the unique challenges and opportunities of
their regions. Some already have
sustainability and/or smart growth programs
that result in GHG reduction. For example,
the Pioneer Valley Planning Commission and
Franklin Regional Council of Governments
recently released a clean energy plan that
charts a path toward greater energy
independence and the use of cleaner and
more efficient energy in the Valley. The
process of creating and now implementing
the plan has been a prime example of state,
regional and local government collaboration,
and engagement of citizens, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and the
private sector.

As the Commonwealth agencies responsible
for implementing parts of this Plan develop
their programs, they will look for
opportunities to work with and support these
ongoing efforts. Most state agencies have a
local presence and networks that can
facilitate coordination with local groups; for
example, MassDEP has four regional offices
and DOER has a Green Communities
coordinator located in each of them.
MassDOT also has regional offices as well as
established relationships with regional
planning organizations and regional transit
authorities. Pilots and demonstration projects
conducted as agencies develop their
respective programs under this Plan will
provide excellent opportunities to involve
local groups in state initiatives.
The work of individuals, municipalities,
universities, business organizations, NGOs,
and regional planning organizations will be
essential to the Commonwealth’s success in
implementing this Plan and making the
transition to a clean energy economy.

NGOs of all types are making effective use of
their community roots to raise consciousness
about the risks of climate change and the
opportunities for a clean energy future.
College and university students are
informed, organized and eager to help shape
their energy and climate future; these
students gave impassioned testimony at
every public hearing.

storage and energy management.
Massachusetts architects and engineers are
leaders internationally in green building
design and building energy management.
Massachusetts companies that have
pioneered battery technology have robust
partnerships with American, European,
Indian and Chinese car and truck
manufacturers.

The clean energy economy of 2050 will be
very different than the fossil fuel dominated
economy of today. With many of the policies
embodied in this report in place, 2050 would
find a Massachusetts where energy costs are
less volatile and comprise a smaller part of
budgets. Businesses, households,
municipalities and institutions are better able
to manage their energy needs. Renewable
and alternative sources of energy have
largely displaced fossil-based sources, and a
smart grid and advanced technology store
and release to the grid as needed the
electricity generated during the night by
massive wind farms off the coast of the
Northeast. Both small and large-scale solar
installations are ubiquitous across the state.

And, by 2050, GHG emissions will, by law, be
80 percent less than what they were in 1990,
and the air will be cleaner.
Even as we chart the course through 2020, it
is critical to plan for the path to 2050.
Getting to this clean energy future will
require significant innovation in policy,
technology and business practices. Unlike
the 2020 limit, which can be met with
actions that we take here in Massachusetts,
reaching 80 percent reductions below 1990
emission levels, as required by the Global
Warming Solutions Act, will mean broad
changes that are beyond the reach of
Massachusetts alone. Between 2010 and
2050, much will change — in the economy,
in federal regulation, and in technology —
that will make possible GHG emission
reductions that would be unthinkable today.
With the nation-leading requirements of the
GWSA, Massachusetts should — and must —
stay ahead of the curve. But as it reaches for
the more ambitious mandates of 2030, 2040,
and 2050 required by the GWSA,
Massachusetts can only build on changes
percolating throughout the U.S. economy,
not strike out entirely on its own.

In this scenario, global geopolitics has
dramatically changed also, and United States
foreign policy is no longer influenced by the
politics of petroleum, natural gas, and coal.
National security has been strengthened by
an economy driven by homegrown sources of
energy that no longer depend on fossil fuel
from unstable regions or from countries that
do not share the interests of the U.S.
By 2050, the clean energy cluster in
Massachusetts has matured, much as the
biotechnology and health care sectors
matured in the early part of the 21st century.
Small entrepreneurial companies and multinationals, R&D, manufacturing and service
companies make up a varied and dynamic
clean energy economic landscape.
Massachusetts plays a dominant role in the
global market for technologies in offshore
wind, solar PV and thermal, electricity

But in imagining — and planning for — a
path to the mandated GHG emissions
reduction of 80 percent in 2050, it is
important to ask now: How do we get there?

NonEnergy
Sources
7.6 (8%)

Efficiency — Finding means to deliver the
same services (e.g., miles traveled by
passenger vehicles, indoor air temperature)
using less energy. Examples include
weatherizing buildings so they consume less
energy to provide comfortable indoor spaces,
and higher fuel efficiency standards for
passenger vehicles and light trucks so that
less fuel is combusted for every mile
traveled.

Use
84.8 (92%)

Conservation — Making lifestyle choices
that lower energy use even in the absence of
efficiency improvements. An example is
reducing non-essential driving.
Cleaner energy sources — Substituting
low carbon energy sources for the carbon
intensive fuels we use today. An example is
generating electricity from wind or solar
energy instead of from fossil fuels.

Figure 10. Massachusetts GHG Emissions in
2007 (MMTCO2e and %)

The first two of these approaches target
energy demand, while the third focuses on
energy supply.

It helps to consider the sources of GHG
emissions in Massachusetts. As Figure 10
shows, the vast majority of our state’s
emissions come from energy use. Burning
carbon intensive fuels for transportation, in
buildings, and for electricity generation
accounted for about 92 percent of statewide
GHG emissions in 2007. The rest of the
emissions — a scant 8 percent — were from
activities other than fuel combustion, such as
wastewater treatment and agriculture (both
of which emit methane and other GHGs).

This chapter explores how these approaches
could be combined with cuts in non-energy
emissions to hit the 2050 target required for
Massachusetts. It presents the results of
scenario modeling of the state’s energy
system and economy, conducted to assess
conditions that would allow achievement of
the 2050 limit. The first part characterizes
the modeling process and explains how the
two scenarios presented here were devised.
A summary of the scenarios and their
emissions and energy projections follows,
along with implications for Massachusetts
clean energy and climate policy. The chapter
goes on to review policies which will either
have small impacts by 2020 or may not be
needed to reach the 2020 emissions limit,
but are critical to achieving the 2050 limit.

Broadly speaking, it is possible to lower GHG
emissions from energy use in three ways:

and Process

technology that is currently available or
expected to emerge shortly. The team also
consulted published scientific and technical
literature and other government and
academic modeling projects for insights into
plausibility.

In order to understand the challenges and
opportunities of meeting the 80 percent by
2050 goal, the EEA began by modeling
scenarios of statewide energy use and GHG
emissions. The scenarios comprised all
modes of transportation, residential and
commercial buildings, electricity generation,
and numerous other factors.

After experimenting with several scenarios,
the modeling team developed two that
achieved the 80 percent target (within a
reasonable margin of error): one stressing
electrification and clean electricity supply;
and another prioritizing efficiency and
conservation measures. The next sections
describe these scenarios. The team also
determined that the target could be
attainable in a scenario of substituting low
carbon biofuels for fossil fuels. However, as
such a scenario is basically equivalent to the
electrification scenario — replacing clean
electricity with clean biofuels — it is not
treated here.

Assisted by technical consultants, EEA used
the scenarios to project potential futures for
Massachusetts that would allow attainment
of the 2050 goal. In this sense, the scenarios
were not so much predictions or forecasts as
thought experiments: they showed possible
ways to cut GHG emissions under various
conditions. A central consideration in crafting
the scenarios was that they be plausible. To
that end, the modeling team limited itself to

Scenario Descriptions: Narratives and Assumptions
SCENARIO 1 — ELECTRIFICATION: A RESIDENT’S VIEW
Houses are better insulated and ventilated than they were 40 years ago. Many houses look
like those from the Massachusetts 2010 Zero Energy Challenge — there are a number in
your neighborhood. Increasingly, homeowners are turning to electric heat pumps for space
and water heating. The cost of these systems has been dropping for a number of years,
and it’s now standard practice to include them in new houses. Solar hot water and
residential photovoltaic (PV) installations are also commonplace. You rented out your
rooftop to a solar PV company last year, cutting your electricity bill in half.
You still drive to work each day, but you do it in a highly efficient electric car. When you
take public transportation, you’re generally in an electric vehicle as well — whether a train,
bus, or subway. You hardly see any petroleum-powered vehicles anymore, except for
airplanes and some trucks. But even those use a 40 percent biofuel blend.
Most commercial buildings are more energy efficient than they were in 2010; a significant
fraction look like the advanced green buildings of that era. Just as in houses, electric heat
pumps, solar hot water, and PV arrays are increasingly the norm in commercial buildings.
You work in an industrial setting — at a advanced battery manufacturer that supplies
batteries for the new fleets of cars, minvans, and trucks that are coming out of Detroit —
and business is booming. Gross state product has more than doubled since 2010, while
industry’s fraction of it is unchanged. Meanwhile, the energy intensity of industrial
operations has been falling, and many firms have retooled their processes around electric
power (instead of fossil fuels). Your employer recently replaced most of the equipment on
the shop floor with new high-efficiency models, improving productivity and cutting
operating expenses.
The electrification scenario meets the challenge of the 2050 goal by pairing widespread
electrification in transportation, buildings, and industry (i.e., switching from fossil fuels to
electricity) with an extremely clean electricity supply. These changes are backed up by
energy efficiency gains throughout the economy and progress toward reducing non-energy
GHG emissions. Table 3 lists the major assumptions defining the electrification scenario.
The narrative in the sidebar describes what you might experience if you were a resident of
Massachusetts in 2050.

Sector

Assumption
The population of Massachusetts grows to 7.6 million people by 2050
(about 18% higher than today).

Statewide

Gross state product (GSP) grows to $930 billion (2008$) by 2050
(approximately 150% higher than today). This increase is based on the
historical rate of per capita income growth in Massachusetts.
By 2050, 90% of light duty vehicles are pure electric, 5% are plug-in
electric, and 5% are hybrids.
By 2050, passenger and freight vehicle efficiency improves substantially.
For example, holding vehicle size constant, the energy intensity of hybrid
gasoline cars (energy required per mile traveled) falls about 31% between
now and 2050.

Transportation

By 2050, transit service doubles and number of people per vehicle
increases 20% from today’s levels.
By 2050, commuter rail and intercity rail in Massachusetts are completely
electric; 90% of buses are electric.
By 2050, 40% of commercial aircraft and road freight miles are powered
by biofuel that produces 70% fewer GHG emissions than burning gasoline.
Growth in annual commercial air travel miles stops in 2020.

Residential
and
Commercial
Buildings

By 2050, only 16% of houses have the same energy use profile as a typical
house today; 40% match the energy performance of today’s advanced
green houses. New and upgraded houses mainly use electric heat pumps
for space and water heating.
By 2050, only 20% of commercial buildings have the same energy use
profile as a typical commercial building today; 40% match the energy
performance of today’s advanced green commercial buildings. New and
upgraded buildings mainly use electric heat pumps for space and water
heating.
Rising at the same rate as GSP, industrial output in Massachusetts grows
to $162 billion (2008$) by 2050.

Industry

40% of industrial energy comes from electricity in 2050.
Between now and 2050, industrial energy intensity (energy required per $
of output) decreases 2% per year on average.

Electricity
Generation

By 2050, 100% of the electricity consumed in Massachusetts comes from
near zero carbon sources: renewables, pre-2000 nuclear facilities, and a
small amount of biomass, and this constitutes 112% of what total
Massachusetts electricity use was in 2007, or 9 times the amount of lowcarbon supply in 2007. The state no longer uses any electricity from
natural gas, coal, or oil.

Scenario Descriptions: Narratives and Assumptions
SCENARIO 2 — EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION SCENARIO: A RESIDENT’S VIEW
Every house in the state uses less energy per square foot than a typical house did 40 years
ago. Improved lighting, insulation, appliances, and heating and cooling systems are
universal. Houses remaining from 2010 have been equipped with these enhancements (to
a greater or lesser degree), and new houses include them as a matter of course. Nearly
half of all houses meet efficiency standards only attained by the best ―green‖ prototypes in
2010. Yours is one of them: when you bought it 10 years ago, you had a deep energy
improvement performed before moving in. The contractor installed an electric heat pump
for heating and cooling, solar hot water collectors, and a PV array, among other
improvements. Residents statewide are increasingly choosing these technologies to meet
household energy needs. They’re also opting for markedly smaller homes, prompting a
reduction in the size of new houses and conversions of large dwellings into multi-family
residences.
For several decades, the trend in passenger vehicles has been toward more efficient cars.
Light trucks have fallen out of favor except with tradespeople who need them for work, as
have SUVs except for those who need true off-road capability, with the number on the
road dropping 75 percent since 2010. Drivers are carpooling more, and everyone thinks
twice about single-purpose drives to the store or the mall. You still have that hybrid, but
your spouse made the switch to an electric car a few years ago, and you take the electric
when you travel together. More and more, you use public transportation when you can. It
helps that transit service is more widespread and frequent than it used to be. You don’t
travel by plane as much as you once did, either; for short and middle distance trips, you
go by high-speed train or your car, and you take long trips less often.
Like everyone you know, you work in a building that’s substantially more energy efficient
than commercial buildings were in 2010. Half of today’s buildings would have been
considered advanced green buildings in 2010, and many use electric heat pumps instead of
fossil fuels.
Industrial output in Massachusetts has more than doubled since 2010, while the energy
intensity of industrial production has fallen by almost two thirds. Enterprises requiring a
skilled, educated workforce continue to locate in the state, contributing to steady economic
growth.
The efficiency and conservation scenario achieves the 2050 goal through a combination of
maximal efficiency gains in all sectors and consumer choices favoring energy efficiency and
conservation. Complementing these developments are some fuel switching toward
electricity, a significant (but not total) de-carbonization of the electricity supply, and cuts
in non-energy emissions. Table 4 shows the principal assumptions underpinning the
efficiency and conservation scenario, and the sidebar provides a parallel narrative — what
you might experience under this scenario if you were a resident of Massachusetts in 2050.

Assumption
The population of Massachusetts grows to 7.6 million people by 2050
(about 18% higher than today).
Gross state product (GSP) grows to $930 billion (2008$) by 2050
(approximately 150% higher than today). This increase is based on the
historical rate of per capita income growth in Massachusetts.
By 2050, 60% of light duty vehicles are pure electric, 20% are plug-in
electric, and 20% are hybrids.
By 2050, passenger and freight vehicle efficiency improves even more
than in scenario 1, with (for example) the energy intensity of hybrid
gasoline cars falling about 36% between now and 2050.
Consumer preferences shift toward more efficient cars. By 2050,
technologies allow cars to use one third less energy than it otherwise
would have.
Apart from those who need special functions, consumers shift away from
light trucks and passenger vehicles built on light truck chassis (SUVs).
By 2050, the share of trucks in the light duty vehicle fleet drops to 10
percent (from around 40 percent today).
By 2050, utilization of cars and light trucks rises to 2.0 people/vehicle
(compared to 1.6 today).
By 2050, less non-essential driving causes the total number of miles
traveled in light duty vehicles to be 15% lower than it would otherwise
have been.
By 2050, transit service increases 2.5 times and ratio of people-pervehicle rises 30% from today’s levels.
By 2050, 40% of commercial aircraft and road freight miles are powered
by biofuel that produces 70% fewer GHG emissions than gasoline.
Annual commercial air travel miles drop 50% between 2010 and 2050 as
regional and intercity rail increases.
By 2050, no houses have the energy use profile of a typical house
today; 45% match the energy performance of today’s advanced green
houses. New and upgraded houses mainly use electric heat pumps for
space and water heating.
By 2050, only 5% of commercial buildings have the energy use profile of
a typical commercial building today; 50% match the energy performance
of today’s advanced green commercial buildings. New and upgraded
buildings mainly use electric heat pumps for space and water heating.
In residential buildings, average square footage per household is about
22% lower in 2050 than today.
Rising at the same rate as GSP, industrial output in Massachusetts grows
to $162 billion (2008$) by 2050.
Between now and 2050, industrial energy intensity decreases 2.5% per
year on average.
By 2050, about 80% of the electricity consumed in Massachusetts comes
from near zero carbon sources: renewables, pre-2000 nuclear facilities,
and a small amount of biomass used in high efficiency combined-heatand-power applications. The low-carbon power is about five times the
amount used in Massachusetts in 2007 (about half the amount of lowcarbon power needed in the electrification scenario). The remainder is
from natural gas generation.

Scenario Results

Significant changes in infrastructure,
technology, and consumer choices pave the
way to the 80 percent reduction. Figure 11
depicts projected statewide GHG emissions
under the scenarios, as well as historic
emissions and a business-as-usual
trajectory.

In both the electrification and efficiency and
conservation scenarios, Massachusetts
reaches the 80 percent target by 2050.
Given the first two assumptions in Tables 1
and 2 — of rising population and real income
— this achievement is remarkable.

Figure 11. Historic and Projected Massachusetts GHG Emissions

The two scenarios have important
commonalities, such as improvements in
vehicle and building efficiency, shifts away
from fossil fuels in transportation and
buildings, and deployment of low carbon
electricity generation. But they differ in how
they combine demand- and supply-side
approaches to reducing GHG emissions from
energy use. In the electrification scenario,
low-carbon supply rises greatly, to 112
percent of total Massachusetts electric
consumption in 2007, or providing nine times
the amount of low-carbon supply that
Massachusetts consumed in 2007. In the
efficiency and conservation scenario, the

low-carbon supply only has to rise to about
five times the 2007 amount.

In the efficiency and conservation scenario,
enhanced efficiency measures and consumer
choices produce lower transportation and
buildings emissions than in the electrification
scenario, notwithstanding some continued
reliance on fossil fuels. These incremental
gains make feasible a somewhat more
carbon intensive energy supply. Figure 13
shows that the efficiency and conservation
scenario allows for more emissions from
electricity generation, whereas more nonemitting electricity sources are needed for
the electrification scenario. Both scenarios
require dramatic reductions in energy use,
but the electrification scenario allows for
somewhat greater electricity generation
(from clean sources) even compared with
today, while the efficiency and conservation
scenario requires less energy use (and
electricity generation) overall.

efficiency by 2050. These gains go further in
the efficiency and conservation scenario,
especially for existing houses — more of
them are upgraded with energy saving
measures and high efficiency mechanical
systems. For residential buildings that exist
in 2010, the electrification scenario assumes
that energy demand per square foot is cut in
half by 2050, while in the efficiency and
conservation scenario it is cut by two-thirds.
Homes that are built between 2010 and 2050
use even less energy, about 50 percent as
much per square foot as existing buildings in
the efficiency/conservation scenario.
There are three ways that transportation
emissions can be reduced — reducing VMT,
improving fuel efficiency, and reducing the
carbon content of vehicle fuel. To achieve an
80 percent emissions reduction, all of these
must achieve large gains relative to Business
as Usual (BAU). In the
electrification scenario,
where vehicles are running
almost entirely on lowcarbon power, VMT for cars
and light trucks is able to
grow from 51 billion miles to
58 billion, while in the
efficiency and conservation
scenario it decreases to 48
billion miles, and the share
of light trucks in the fleet
drops steeply. Vehicle
efficiency improves greatly in
both scenarios, but more so
in the efficiency and
conservation scenario.
Conversely, carbon
emissions per unit of fuel are only about half
as large in the electrification scenario, at 114
grams of CO2 per kwh of energy input, as
they are in the efficiency and conservation
scenario (at 217 grams CO2 per kwh).

The transportation and buildings sectors are
by far the largest end users of energy in
Massachusetts. Both scenarios count on
considerable gains in building energy

IV. Beyond 2020: The Road to 80 Percent Lower Emissions in 2050

Policy Directions to be Developed in Coming Years
As the scenarios show, reducing emissions
by 80 percent in 2050 depends on dramatic
changes in energy and transportation
systems. Some of the policy changes that
are critical to reaching the 2050 reduction
requirement are included in the 2020 policies
discussed earlier in this Plan. But the GHG
reductions shown are relatively small,
because these policies need long lead times
for development and their impacts grow over
time, becoming more significant after 2020.
In addition, further new policies will be
needed that are not necessary to reach the
2020 target, but are essential to reaching
the 2050 mandate. Below we briefly review
both sets of policy possibilities.

Building rating and labeling — At present,
the likely energy use of existing buildings,
both commercial and residential, is largely
unknown to prospective purchasers and
tenants. As a result, the built-in efficiency of
a building (as distinct from occupant
behavior) has little value in the marketplace.
Rating the energy performance of buildings
relative to an objective standard for others of
the same size and type will make it possible
for sales and rental prices to take energy use
into account, giving owners an incentive to
improve performance for resale value. In
addition, rating and labeling are
prerequisites to instituting performance
requirements, which will become necessary
over time in order to reduce the average
consumption of existing buildings.

Policies in 2020 Plan that have
relatively small impacts in
2020 but are critical for 2050

Building codes — To achieve the dramatic
reductions in energy use that is needed for
new buildings, building additions, and major
renovations of existing buildings, continual
updating of building codes is the most costeffective policy. This will require conversion
of traditional ―prescriptive‖ codes, which
dictate specific measures, to performancebased standards, and tightening over time of
the energy requirements. Technological
development, experience within the industry,
and increases in the real cost of energy,
along with an eventual price of carbon,
should make such tightening cost effective.
Recent trends and projections for the next
few years in the IECC and American Society
of Heating, Refrigerating and AirConditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE)
standards show that continual improvement
in codes is feasible. Again, because buildings
are so long-lasting, it is essential that
improvements in the shells of new buildings
(insulation and air sealing) be ramped up as
quickly as possible.

Buildings — As the scenarios show, on
average energy use must drop by at least 42
percent for existing buildings in the
electrification scenario and by 69 percent in
the efficiency/conservation scenario by 2050.
To accomplish this, policies to achieve much
deeper reductions in energy use than result
from the current utility programs will be
needed. For new buildings, this can result
largely from code requirements, while for
existing buildings it is likely that other forms
of incentives and regulatory requirements
will be needed. Because buildings are so
long-lasting, investments that are made in
2011 and beyond are likely to yield GHG
savings for a century or more, while
inefficiencies that are not rectified will
produce excess emissions for decades. Four
of the proposed policies to address this have
been discussed in detail earlier in this Plan,
but are worth re-emphasizing in their
importance for 2050.

104

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
IV. Beyond 2020: The Road to 80 Percent Lower Emissions in 2050

Deep energy improvements — Today,
utility-administered efficiency programs
provide incentives for ―moderate‖ retrofits of
existing buildings, such as installing
insulation in attics and in exterior wall
cavities, purchasing compact fluorescent
light bulbs and high-efficiency commercial
light fixtures, and more efficient appliances.
Achieving nearly universal adoption of such
items should be sufficient to reach the 2020
GHG target, but not for 2050. ―Deeper‖
retrofits, including such items as rigid
insulation on the exterior walls of buildings
under new siding, triple-glazed windows, LED
lighting, and renewable heating systems, will
all be needed.

with mixed residential, shopping, and
employment uses to reduce transportation
needs. Because development in
Massachusetts is occurring slowly, the
savings from smart growth are relatively
small in 2020 but will be much greater in
2050. Without new development taking place
primarily in smart growth fashion, however,
it will not be possible to reach the necessary
emissions reduction from transportation.
Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) — To
achieve the 80 percent reduction limit, the
average carbon content of vehicle fuel falls
by 54 percent in the electrification scenario
and by 12 percent in the efficiency /
conservation scenario. This will require the
conversion of a majority of motor vehicles
from petroleum to other fuel sources, such
as electricity or biofuels. The 2020 Plan
anticipates that introduction of a LCFS will
mandate a 5 percent reduction in the
average carbon content of light vehicle fuel,
contributing modestly to the 2020 limit. But
for 2050 the LCFS must become far stricter,
and be supported by other policies necessary
for the LCFS to succeed (such as
development of fueling infrastructure).

Tree retention and planting — Because
trees grow slowly, planting done in the next
decade will have small benefits by 2020, but
will contribute greatly to the 2050 target by
reducing cooling and heating loads in
buildings. In addition, though it is not
counted in this Plan due to data limitations,
planting more trees will result in greater
sequestration of GHGs.
Transportation — to reduce transportation
emissions on the order of 80 percent, all
three of the primary drivers of emissions will
have to be addressed — vehicle efficiency
(including driving habits), miles driven, and
carbon content of vehicle fuel. The measures
below are some of the methods for
influencing these three areas.
Smart Growth — To achieve the GHG
target, VMT for light vehicles (cars and light
trucks) must be reduced by 15 percent in the
efficiency/conservation scenario versus the
business-as-usual scenario. One of the
primary influences on VMT is development
pattern, with sprawling business and housing
development increasing the amount of nondiscretionary driving. This impact can be
reduced through smart growth, which
concentrates development in and around
existing cities and in more compact areas

IV. Beyond 2020: The Road to 80 Percent Lower Emissions in 2050

Policies not in the 2020 Plan
that are needed for 2050

that sufficient supplies are available, new
policy mechanisms will need to be developed
that go beyond the RPS, such as the Clean
Energy Performance Standard discussed
earlier in this Plan.

Beyond the measures described above and
earlier in this Plan, the 2050 scenarios make
clear that additional measures will be
necessary to achieve an 80 percent GHG
reduction at that time:

Converting motor vehicles from
petroleum to other fuels — The LCFS is
the state’s primary policy mechanism for
encouraging a shift from petroleum to lowcarbon vehicle fuels. However, there is
evidence that the LCFS may not by itself be
sufficient to cause this shift without
complementary policies to induce consumers
to shift to alternative fuels.78 At least in part,
this result stems from the difficulty in
simultaneously developing alternative fuel
sources, the infrastructure to distribute the
fuels, and the vehicles that can utilize them.
For example, converting a substantial portion
of vehicle fuel to electricity requires that
electric charging stations be installed at
homes and businesses and at public
locations, that auto manufacturers produce a
variety of plug-in hybrid and all-electric
vehicles, and that consumers purchase these
vehicles in large numbers at a premium to
conventional vehicles (at least in the early
years). Substantial incentives for fueling
infrastructure and for consumers to purchase
the vehicles may be necessary.

Decarbonizing the electricity supply — In
both scenarios for 2050, the vast majority of
electricity supply must be low-carbon (70 or
80 percent lower than the average emissions
from the New England grid at present). Less
of this supply is needed in the
efficiency/lifestyle scenario than in the
electrification scenario. The resources to
achieve this shift are theoretically available,
if not entirely in Massachusetts (given our
small size and limited supply of renewable
resources), then in imports from the region
and beyond. The current RPS requires that
the state’s distribution utilities supply 15
percent of their power from qualifying
renewable sources by 2020. For 2050 we will
need far more resources from both RPSeligible and non-RPS qualified sources. Part
of this we expect will be obtained from
offshore wind resources, which are ample in
federal waters off Massachusetts. Part will
come from non-RPS sources such as
Canadian hydro and wind power. To ensure

Methodology for Estimating Policy
Impacts on Employment in 2020
State government policies affect employment
in several ways. First, employment in a
particular industry whose development is
affected can be raised or lowered. Second,
every industry buys goods and services from
other industries, thus ―indirectly‖ creating
employment. And third, both employees and
owners spend their incomes, creating
―induced‖ employment. The size of
employment changes depends greatly on
what portion of an industry’s income, and of
household incomes, are spent within a state
(or other geographic area being considered),
and the capital- or labor-intensity of an
industry, with labor-intensive ones generally
yielding larger employment gains.
For purposes of this Plan, we have examined
changes in the demand for the products of
various industries, mainly those involved in
energy production and consumption and in
transportation. In general, the
Commonwealth’s and the federal
government’s energy and climate policies are
designed to shift spending away from fossil
fuels and toward energy efficiency and
renewable energy, causing shifts in spending
among industries. For example, federal fuel
efficiency/vehicle CO2 standards cause an
increase in the cost of manufacturing autos,
but the reduction in spending on gasoline
and diesel fuel is several times larger than
the higher manufacturing costs. Incomes of
Massachusetts households rise by the
difference between their savings on fuel and
their extra spending on new vehicles, and,
when they spend this money in
Massachusetts, employment in
Massachusetts rises. Income for auto
manufacturers rises, but, since there are no
auto plants in Massachusetts, almost all of

this goes out of state, except for the small
fraction gained by auto dealers. Income to
the petroleum industry falls greatly, but this
impact is primarily felt out of the state and
out of the country, except for the reduced
income to retailers. On balance, we estimate
that in 2020 federal efficiency standards for
light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles will
raise employment in Massachusetts by 7,000
jobs, driven by fuel savings that no longer go
outside the Commonwealth, but that can
now be spent in Massachusetts.
A similar procedure has been used for most
of the major policies included in this Plan,
wherever it was possible to make reliable
estimates of the impact of a policy on energy
production and consumption, and, as a
result, on the incomes and expenses of
various industries and on households. The
first step in each case is to estimate the
dollar value of changes in energy usage, and
the amounts of higher or lower spending that
will occur in each industry. To convert these
to employment changes, several different
models can be used; we have utilized the
RIMS (Regional Input-Output Multiplier
System) of the Bureau of Economic Analysis
(BEA) in the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Specifically, the RIMS Type II multipliers
provide an estimate of the number of jobs in
Massachusetts that result from an increase in
spending of $1 million on an industry located
in the Commonwealth — due to ―direct‖ jobs
within the industry itself, ―indirect‖ jobs at
suppliers to the industry, and ―induced‖ jobs
from spending by employees of the industry.
The multipliers must be adjusted for the
degree to which spending on an industry, or
by an industry, goes out of the state — such
as purchases of fuel or equipment from
outside the Commonwealth.
When energy costs, such as electricity bills,
fall, this is a gain to the incomes of both

Page 107

Massachusetts Clean Energy and Climate Plan for 2020
V. Appendix

households and businesses. To estimate the
resulting employment changes, we need to
know how much of the savings goes to
households and to each type of business,
and how each spend their money. The split
between households and businesses can be
obtained from the state’s electric utilities.
Then, for households, we have used the
Consumer Expenditure Survey of the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics as the basis for
how families will spend their energy savings.
Combining this with the employment
multipliers for each industry, we have
constructed an employment multiplier for
household spending. For businesses, we
have used BEA data on the share of
Massachusetts Gross Domestic Product
coming from each industry, in combination
with BEA multiplier data that shows the
percentage of each industry’s spending that
goes to utility costs. These two data sources,
then combined with the overall employment
multipliers for each industry, give us an
estimate of what the employment change
will be in Massachusetts for a change of $1
million in business spending on electricity
bills.
This procedure was used for those policies
where the dominant change was a reduction
in fossil fuel spending, and the changes to
other industries in Massachusetts could be
predicted with some reliability — which
includes federal and state vehicle efficiency
policies, policies to affect vehicle miles
traveled, utility-administered buildings
efficiency policies, building codes, and
federal appliance/product efficiency
standards. However, for renewable energy
policies, more of the employment impact
comes from growth in the renewable energy
industries themselves, including equipment
and fuel supplies. For these, we lack
Massachusetts-specific studies on the likely
development of relevant businesses within
the Commonwealth by 2020 — such as
manufacturing of solar photovoltaic panels or

wind turbines, or conversion of biomass into
cellulosic biofuels. We have therefore utilized
national-level studies of employment
changes due to increased reliance on
renewable energy (primarily electricity),
some of which have provided state-by-state
estimates. However, such studies have not,
in general, predicted the degree to which
renewable energy industries will develop to
differing degrees within different states.
These studies usually provide results based
either on the current status of the industries
by state, or simply based on the overall size
of a state’s economy. For this reason, in our
results shown in this Plan, we have given a
broad range for possible employment in
2020 from renewable energy industries.
In most cases, policies as they existed prior
to 2008 are considered part of the BAU trend
for GHG emissions — for example a portion
of savings from building codes and federal
appliance standards. Only the post-2008
expansion of programs or creation of new
programs are counted as causing reductions
from the BAU in GHG. Consequently, energy
savings, and the resulting jobs, deriving from
pre-2008 policies have in most cases not
been counted here. However, the
Massachusetts DPU requires DOER to report
on the impacts of all efficiency spending,
including the level that existed prior to 2008.
In order to be consistent with the figures
reported to the DPU, the employment figures
shown here are based on all efficiency
spending.
