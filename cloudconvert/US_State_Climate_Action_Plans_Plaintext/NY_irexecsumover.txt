Executive Summary
New York State Climate Action Plan
Interim Report
The Challenge and the Opportunity
Climate change, resulting primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels and other human
activities, is a significant threat to our environment, economy, and communities. Climate change
is already occurring; its adverse effects are well documented across the globe and throughout our
region. That realization, combined with the economic and national security vulnerability
associated with our current, finite, fossil-based energy system, has created a sense of urgency in
advancing a sustainable low-carbon energy future.
New York State can turn this challenge into an opportunity by
working aggressively to become a hub of the new clean energy
economy and by making policies and investments that bring lowcarbon choices to our citizens and future generations. Success will
bring dramatic co-benefits in economic development, jobs,
technological innovation, energy security, and cleaner air and
water.

New York has shown leadership in clean energy policy, and is
taking actions to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases
(GHGs) that cause human-induced climate change. Governor
Paterson’s issuance of Executive Order 24 in August 2009
formally established a State goal of reducing GHG emissions 80
percent below 1990 levels by 2050 (or 80 by 50), and named the
Climate Action Council to determine how to meet the goal. The
Council was also tasked with developing a plan to increase New
York’s resiliency to a rapidly changing climate.

State agencies then launched a process that has brought together more than 100 technical experts
and stakeholders and the broader public to define a vision of New York that can achieve this
aggressive goal, to identify and examine both mitigation and adaptation policy options, and to
analyze the costs and benefits of adopting these policies.

Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in New York State
A variety of policy options and strategies can build on New York’s experience in advancing
clean energy and further reduce GHG emissions in New York State, while providing other
benefits to New Yorkers.
•

Buildings and Industry

competitive, while reducing GHG emissions per unit output. Policy options include enhanced
performance-based building codes and appliance standards; building commissioning; and
additional consumer incentives for efficiency and renewable energy. The combination of
voluntary incentives and aggressive codes and standards, along with new financing
mechanisms and critical enabling policies (such as education and outreach, electric rate
design, workforce development, and
technology research and development),
could lead to a substantial reduction in
emissions in this sector over time. This
sector is the largest source of GHGs in
New York, accounting for about 40
percent of the state’s GHG emissions.
• Transportation and Land Use
Sector Policy Options: Reduce the GHG
intensity of fuel, improve vehicular
efficiency, and improve travel and system
efficiency. Policy options include the

sector holds great promise in both reducing GHG emissions in New York and reducing the
petroleum dependency of this sector. Investments in transit and high-speed rail appear to
offer additional opportunities to reduce GHG emissions and enable a low-carbon future,
while providing very significant co-benefits. These policies could reduce GHG emissions
from the fastest growing source of emissions in our economy—transportation.
•

Power Supply and Delivery Sector Policy Options:
Accelerate the introduction of zero- or low-carbon
sources of power, such as renewable energy and
potentially nuclear energy, while maintaining the
reliability of the electric grid. Policy options include a
more aggressive renewable portfolio standard
potentially evolving into a low-carbon portfolio
standard; expansion of the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative; GHG emission standards for new power
plants; policies to facilitate the siting of new power
plants; and policies to encourage repowering of
existing fossil fuel plants. These policies, combined

distribution network upgrading, energy storage) could
reduce the GHG emissions from this important sector, which is the backbone of a low-carbon
future.

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Sector Policy Options: Promoting sustainable
production and conversion of biomass feedstocks; improving land management to maximize
carbon uptake; supporting on-farm renewable energy and energy efficiency; increasing the
availability of locally produced foods; and reducing waste are some of the key policies in this
sector. While a small source of GHG emissions in New York, this sector is unique in that it
can serve as a sink for carbon and as a potential source for low-carbon biofuels.

This Interim Report also presents preliminary quantitative analysis of the costs, savings, and
GHG emission reduction potential for individual mitigation policy options relative to a mid-point
40 by 30 benchmark target, i.e., 40 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. While further
economic analysis is needed, some general observations can be made from the analysis to date:
•

No single policy can deliver the level of emission reduction needed to achieve a 40 by 30
target. A portfolio of policies will be needed to reduce emissions from the many different
GHG sources throughout our economy.

•

A linear path to achieving 80 by 50 may not be feasible nor optimal for a state like New
York, which is already one of the most carbon-efficient states in the country on a per capita
basis. We may need to ratchet up the stringency of the policies over time to increase the rate
of emission reduction as technologies and markets mature.

•

There are a number of policies—particularly in the Buildings, Industry, and Transportation
sectors— that represent cost-effective ways to take a meaningful step toward a low-carbon
future. These “No Regrets” policies, which are primarily efficiency policies, represent

ES-3

options for early action. Further analysis of benefits and costs, and strategies to finance
and/or fund, will be needed.
•

Energy efficiency policies alone, however, will not deliver the level of emission reduction
needed to achieve a 40 by 30 target (and ultimately 80 by 50). To make appreciable progress
toward these aggressive goals and to break our dependence on finite fossil-fuel resources, the
State will need to continue to strategically advance low-carbon energy supply-side policies
and infrastructure investments, particularly focusing on policies that provide significant cobenefits to New Yorkers (e.g., improvements in local air quality, opportunities for economic
development, and job creation).

As a single state attempting to address a global problem, maximizing the co-benefits in New
York State associated with GHG mitigation policies will be necessary to maintain public support
for GHG reduction investments.
New York will need to work
in partnership with other
states to craft regional
solutions, and to have the
federal government as an
active and financially
supportive partner.

Creating the clean energy economy requires clear and
consistent public policies, and sustained and significant
public and private investment. To achieve aggressive GHG
reduction goals and reap the benefits, New York will need
to be resolute in pursuing forward-looking policies and
continuing to advance technology. New York will need to
work in partnership with other states to craft regional
solutions, and to have the federal government as an active
and financially supportive partner.

To turn climate policy into an engine for economic growth,
we will need to ensure that the State’s economic development policies are focused on emerging
growth markets; that State policies foster a robust technology development and
commercialization system; that we have a skilled workforce and a dynamic workforce
development system; and that public and private sectors are fully engaged as partners.

Managing the Risks in New York State Associated with a Changing
Climate
Climate change has already put in motion certain environmental impacts in New York, and
further changes are likely. According to the latest assessment from a team of scientists at the
NASA Goddard Institute, Columbia University, Cornell University, and the City University of
New York—the average air and water temperatures in New York and the region are projected to
increase significantly over the coming decades and heat waves are expected to become more
frequent and more intense. Summertime rain is expected to fall more often as heavy downpours,
leading to more flooding; at the same time, the periods between these rainstorms are likely to be
drier, leading to droughts. By the year 2100, sea levels along our coast and the Hudson River
estuary are projected to rise between 12 and 55 inches, increasing storm-related coastal flooding.
The projected rate of change in our climate is unprecedented in our human history. And only
through aggressive global action will we be able to change this path.

Measures to increase the resilience of our communities must begin now. Common sense actions,
such as vulnerability assessments and emergency preparedness, are required to protect a range of
sectors, from agriculture to public health
to utilities. Adaptation can be thought of
simply as responsible planning,

Public and private entities will need to assess whether new investments in infrastructure,
particularly long-lived infrastructure like power plants and transportation, will be consistent with
a low-carbon future, both in terms of GHG emissions and in terms of vulnerability to a changing
climate. We should avoid investments that are not highly adapted to a modified climate, such as
infrastructure sited in low-lying floodplains.

Managing Uncertainty and Taking the Long View
While some of the policy options offered for consideration in this Interim Report rely on
technologies that are still rapidly evolving, others make use of technologies readily available
today, such as energy efficiency measures in new and existing buildings, wind, and solar power,
investments in public transportation systems, and smart landuse planning that, by promoting mixed use and transportationClimate change will affect

for government. Effective response includes reducing
emissions, unleashing innovation, capitalizing on the economic
opportunity of a clean energy economy, reducing reliance on petroleum (stemming the flow of
billions of energy dollars out of state), and helping communities become as well-prepared and
resilient to climate change as possible. Significant economic and environmental co-benefits will
flow from this response, satisfying important economic and public health goals.
An effective response will not be easy. It will require long-term dedication and a willingness to
make the public and private investments to keep moving in the right direction (especially

challenging in today’s fiscal climate). But ignoring the need for action will be dramatically more
costly over the long term, and New York will miss a great opportunity to be in the forefront of
the emerging low-carbon, clean energy economy.

Next Steps
With this Interim Report, the Climate Action Council is seeking stakeholder and public response
to the initial climate action planning work, including input on the mitigation and adaptation
policy options. During 2011, work will continue to complete the required analyses of the policy
options, which will inform a final Climate Action Plan.
New York State will then need to develop more specific near-term implementation strategies to
effectuate policy and practice. The State will need to establish clear targets and evaluate progress
toward those targets. A mechanism to update this long-term plan on a regular basis will be
needed, as the technology, the state-of-science, and the broader public policy environment will
continue to change.
Further, given the strong linkages between GHG emissions and energy policy, strategies to
reduce GHG emissions will also need to be considered further in the development of New
York’s State Energy Plan as well as in other planning processes, such as State implementation
plans for various co-pollutants.
The recently enacted Article 6 of the Energy Law requires the State Energy Plan to include an
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, and strategies for facilitating and accelerating the use of
low-carbon energy sources and carbon mitigation measures. Thus, the State Energy Plan will
become a mechanism to deliberate and advance appropriate energy policy that fully accounts for
the climate change impacts from New York energy production and use.

Overview
Climate Action Plan Interim Report
1.0 Climate Change and the Imperative for Action
Humans are conducting a vast experiment on Earth’s systems. Combustion of fossil fuels and
land use change on a global scale are driving alterations to the Earth’s climate. Human-made
global climate change is underway. Scientists have spent the past several decades intensively
studying our planet’s temperature and climate history, assessing how our natural climate has
changed and projecting how future human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) will trap still
more excess heat in the Earth’s land, ocean, and atmosphere, further changing the climate. Key
findings include the following:
•

That our climate is changing is no longer in question. Worldwide temperature measurements
of land, oceans, and air document that the average temperature of the earth is rising. A
considerable portion of this temperature rise is attributed to human activities—primarily
deforestation and the combustion of fossil fuels.

•

Natural processes required hundreds of millions of years to turn the stored carbon from
ancient plants into our fossil fuels. In the short time (geologically speaking) since the
Industrial Revolution, fossil fuel combustion has
injected large amounts of this long-stored carbon into

•

GHGs will continue to increase global temperatures for
some decades, actions taken now can dramatically
decrease impacts for current and future generations. Decisive emission reduction that keeps
atmospheric GHG concentrations below threshold levels could mean the difference between
climate changes to which humans can likely adapt and very severe impacts. Scientists
forecast that an 80 percent reduction in GHG emissions, achieved by mid-century, has a good
chance of minimizing the worst of the potential impacts. Integrating climate adaptation into
current decision making can reduce the costs and disruption of the unavoidable impacts
already built into the climate system.

•

The best available information suggests that, for the most part, the “new” climate that will
result if emissions continue on today’s path will be less hospitable to human civilization than
the climate that has prevailed for millennia—possibly different enough to lead to widespread
social disruptions, and certainly enough to impose huge costs.

•

In New York State, climate change has begun to affect, and will continue to affect the natural
resources that support our economy and quality of life: air quality, water quality, marine and
freshwater fisheries, plant and wildlife species, salt and freshwater wetlands, surface and
subsurface drinking water supplies, forests, and other wildlife habitats.

•

Our economy, communities, and natural systems are vulnerable to higher temperatures, rising
sea level, and more variable, intense weather: agriculture and forestry (e.g., new pests,
reductions in crop yields and viability); electric transmission efficiency and power demands
(e.g., hotter days mean more air cooling); communications and transportation infrastructure,
especially structures in low-lying areas; public health (e.g., increases in heat-related deaths
and in cardiovascular, respiratory, and vector-borne illness); and interruptions in food and
drinking water availability.

The human role in planetary warming and climate change
gives us both the opportunity and the responsibility to avert
or limit the impending changes. Climate science suggests
that we can avoid the worst consequences of climate change
if we mitigate (reduce or sequester) our emissions of GHGs
and take measures to adapt to unavoidable climate change.

Climate change is a global problem requiring global
solutions and local action. Businesses and communities,
states and nations are beginning to respond to the challenge
by fostering low-carbon energy and economic development
patterns. Leaders of this response are positioned to reap
economic and social benefits from the transition, while
rigid, inflexible economies risk losing competitive positions
in the global marketplace. If we fail to reduce GHG emissions and adapt to unavoidable changes,
future generations will be forced to bear significant consequences.

2.0 Responding to Climate Change: Climate Action Planning in New
York
New York State is leading a candid discussion of responses to the threats and opportunities of a
changing climate. The context for this discussion is the goal established by Executive Order 24
for a reduction of GHG emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 (80 by 50). This goal
is based on the consensus of the scientific community that this magnitude of emission reduction
is needed to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts from climate change.
This Interim Report is an important element in the planning process. It presents for consideration
by decision makers, businesses and citizens the overarching goals and initial outcomes of New
York’s climate planning process:
•

A long-term vision for a climate-resilient, low-carbon, clean energy future for New York

•

The long-term 80 by 50 goal and a mid-term benchmark target of reducing GHG emissions
by 40 percent by the year 2030 (40 by 30)

•

A preliminary list of policy options that, if broadly adopted, have the potential to
dramatically reduce emissions and increase resiliency to a changing climate, while providing
other benefits to New Yorkers in the near term

•

Initial expert analysis on the relative costs of different GHG mitigation policy options

OV-2

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

•

Initial strategies to link climate and energy policy with economic development opportunities,
in particular those associated with growing a clean energy economy.

In 2011, the Climate Action Council will further refine these preliminary ideas, finalize cost
information and economic potentials, analyze the macroeconomic impacts of the policies, and
outline a strategy for implementation.
As climate change is a long-term issue that touches on many facets of our society and economy,
New York’s climate planning process must be ongoing and iterative—establishing needs; raising
and refining ideas, action plans, and cost estimates; adopting policies at various time scales; and
checking to see whether the policies are accomplishing the goals. The Climate Action Plan is
intended to lead and motivate a sustained effort by business, government, and individuals to
mitigate GHG emissions, adapt to a changing climate, and reap the societal and economic
benefits of a low-carbon economy.
Policies to address climate change cannot be developed in isolation. Using energy has been
characterized as "the metabolism of modern industrial society." As such, development of climate
policies cannot be separated from energy security, energy affordability, economic activity, and
overall quality of life. These linkages and constraints must be considered in formulating and
developing realistic policy options.
Transformation of our fossil fuel economy into a clean energy economy will be the work of a
generation, involving large numbers of investors
and workers, a wide variety of skills, and action
and support by both public and private sectors.

Overarching Goals of New York’s Climate Action Plan
•

Provide a set of long-term objectives to guide State decision making.

•

Set out the policies that will enable both climate change adaptation and mitigation, helping to
ensure that New York State does not make decisions in the near term that will lock in a highcarbon future or increase our vulnerability to changes in climate (such as building long-lived
infrastructure that is carbon intense or climate vulnerable).

•

Identify core solutions and strategically allocate available funding to effectively reduce GHG
emissions and stimulate economic activity, while promoting constructive responses by other
states and the nation as a whole.

•

Provide a foundation for New York to gain advantage in the emerging low-carbon, clean
energy economy, advancing the state’s economic and strategic interests in the short and long
term.

New York State Climate Action Policy Options
At the center of this Interim Report are policy options to achieve GHG emissions mitigation and
climate change adaptation. The policies were selected for their potential to minimize costs,
maximize co-benefits, and integrate environmental justice and other important public policy
objectives. Additional analysis and further development of these policies will be carried out in
the next phase of climate action planning.
Mitigation: policy options to reduce emissions cover four categories of GHG emission sources:
Residential, Commercial/Institutional and Industrial buildings and processes (RCI);
Transportation and Land Use (TLU); Electric Power Supply and Distribution (PSD); and
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste (AFW).
Adaptation: policy options to increase climate resiliency cover eight sectors (Agriculture,
Coastal Zones, Ecosystems, Energy, Public Health, Transportation, Telecommunications, and
Water Resources).

The Climate Action Council's website,
www.nyclimatechange.us, provides
access to New York’s climate planning
process.

These policy options were developed through a collaborative
process that included more than 100 technical experts and
stakeholders, along with staff experts from 13 State agencies.
The Climate Action Council convened New York stakeholders,
calling on experts from New York and beyond to take part in
Technical Work Groups and an Integration Advisory Panel.
Since February 2010, these groups have been examining
mitigation and adaptation policy options available to the State.
The Council‘s comprehensive web site offers detailed
information about the process at www.nyclimatechange.us.

This Interim Report builds on extensive previous work. Data
on emissions and policy design came from New York’s
experience with programs supporting development of renewable energy systems and energy
efficiency and the development of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). In particular,
the 2009 New York State Energy Plan significantly advanced understanding of GHG mitigation,
through preliminary technical assessments of greenhouse gas science, emissions, and the scope
of needed mitigation actions. The State Sea Level Rise Task Force, the Assessment for Effective
Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in New York State (ClimAID), PlaNYC, and New York
City’s extensive adaptation analyses provide foundational data for statewide adaptation
recommendations.
Public Input, Further Planning Work, and Implementation
With this Interim Report, the Climate Action Council is seeking stakeholder and public response
to the initial climate action planning work, including input on the policy options. During 2011,
the Council will complete additional analyses and design of the policy options and transmit its
recommendations in a Climate Action Plan. That plan will include the following:
•

Economic assessments, including both the cost of inaction and macroeconomic impacts in
New York, such as creating jobs and retaining some of the $38 billion dollars that is exported
annually from New York to pay for energy imports

sectors of the economy. Although many
policy options offer substantial savings to
consumers, there are notable exceptions that

To fund some policy proposals, New York
State will need to identify new funding mechanisms of sufficient magnitude and duration to
catalyze a change in how we produce or use energy. Such funding sources could be created by a
combination of carbon pricing, federal cost sharing, and public-private partnerships. Leveraging
private capital will be absolutely critical to achieving a goal as bold as 80 by 50. Public funding
should come from sources that directly link revenue generation to GHGs, promoting efficiency
and low-carbon technologies, and avoiding burdens on desired activities such as economic
activity and employment.
Policies must be crafted in a way that promotes clean energy and low-carbon investment,
optimizes public investment dollars, and places New York at a competitive advantage both
nationally and globally. Recognizing the current fiscal constraints, the Council recommends a
staged or phased approach to this grand challenge.

3.0 A Clean Energy Economy in New York
New York could become the regional, national, and international hub of clean technology
industry and innovation—creating good jobs for New Yorkers. A portfolio of State policies

maximize economic development potential, turning climate policy into an engine for economic
growth.

NYS Climate Action Plan
Energy Terminology
Low-carbon and near-zero-carbon
energy refer to energy from sources
whose carbon intensity (CO2 emitted
per unit of energy) is significantly
lower than that of traditional fossil
fuels. Low-carbon sources include
renewables (solar, hydroelectric,
sustainable biomass, wind, marine,
tidal, and geothermal power), nuclear
power, and energy produced by
processes that capture and sequester
CO2 from fossil fuel combustion.
The term clean energy includes the
suite of environmentally sustainable
energy supply and demand
technologies and systems in all
industries. It includes renewable
energy, energy storage, and efficient
transportation technology, as well as
technologies and systems that
improve energy efficiency.

Much has been written about the potential growth of
the burgeoning clean energy economy and the
competition for these emerging markets is fierce and
global. New York is well positioned to compete in
this economic race: New York has long been a leader
in energy technology innovation and
commercialization, with a well established worldclass research infrastructure and a major financial and
venture capital industry. New York has a superior
higher education system, natural resources necessary
to power a low-carbon economy, and a productive
and skilled labor force that can readily transition into
new energy industries and markets.
The clean energy economy includes these critical
building blocks:

1. Robust Market Demand for Clean Energy
Products and Services: Strong market demand must
exist to motivate companies to make investments in
facilities, manufacturing, services infrastructure, and
research and development. Policies at the
international, national, and state level can help create
this demand. Such policies include market-pull
policies (e.g., a Renewable Portfolio Standard, or
RPS), financial incentives/disincentives (e.g., a price on carbon emissions), regulations/codes,
procurement guidelines, and a variety of other mechanisms analyzed in this Interim Report.
Market demand is the critical foundation for advancing a clean energy economy.
2. Skilled Clean Energy Workforce and Dynamic
Workforce Development System: A skilled workforce will
help companies to grow and locate in New York State. In an
innovation-based economic model, a full spectrum of skill
levels is needed—from the technician servicing customers’
repair and installation needs to the CEO who attracts
investment and runs the company. A dynamic workforce
development system meeting the needs of a clean energy
economy must take a long view to develop the human capital
needed to prepare New York to capture the benefits of a
clean energy economy.

Jobs involved with weatherizing
buildings and other aspects of the
clean energy economy keep energy
dollars in the local community.

3. Technology Innovation and Commercialization
Ecosystem: To provide more options and lower cost
solutions, substantial and sustained investment in energy
technology research and development and new approaches to accelerate technology

commercialization must be developed. A fully
integrated network of inventors, entrepreneurs,
financiers, and market experts—with many
vital connections much like a natural
ecosystem—will together spur creation of new
clean energy companies that will take the risks
needed to produce new products and services.
New York has the key ingredients for robust
job-creating, energy-technology innovation.
With State policies that support the entire
innovation ecosystem, New York could reap
substantial economic gains by developing and
manufacturing high-value clean energy
products for local use and for international
markets.

4. Focused and Sustained Economic
Development Strategies that Support Clean
Energy: New York must embrace a model for
economic development that builds on its
strengths as a knowledge-based economy and
that recognizes that the state will struggle to
compete in low-cost commoditized markets. State economic development policies should
support the retention of jobs and the creation of new businesses and jobs in emerging highgrowth markets, such as clean technology industries. Economic development policies must
embrace the new emerging economy of the 21st century— an economy whose growth is based
on innovation, knowledge, and entrepreneurship.
5. Fully Engaged Private and Public Sector: Achieving a goal as transformational as
80 by 50 is possible only with the full and sustained commitment of all levels of the public and
private sectors. The clean energy revolution will ultimately depend on linkages and support from
the federal government, State government, businesses, academic institutions, not-for profits and
municipal governments—each of which plays an important role in the transformation to a clean
energy economy. And support from the public at large is a prerequisite for policymakers in New
York to advance and sustain the climate-energy policy options presented here.

4.0 Potential Climate Change Impacts and Vulnerabilities in New York
Global climate models project that the Earth will warm in the next century, in a consistent
geographical pattern. This climate change threatens New York’s natural resources, economy, and
the health and lifestyle of its residents. For example, New York State’s average air temperatures
are projected to increase significantly over the coming decades, and heat waves are expected to
become more frequent and intense. Summertime rain is expected to fall more often as heavy
downpours, leading to more flooding; at the same time, the periods between these rainstorms are
likely to be drier, leading to droughts. By the year 2100, sea levels along our coast and the
Hudson River estuary are projected to rise between 12 and 55 inches, increasing storm-related
coastal flooding.

The Integrated Assessment for Effective Climate Change Adaptation Strategies in New York
State (ClimAID) is a comprehensive project to provide New York State decision makers with the
best available climate science and other information on the state’s vulnerability to, and possible
benefits from, climate change. The study also aims to facilitate development of adaptation
strategies informed by both local experience and scientific knowledge. To make it easier to
assess potential impacts under future conditions, the ClimAID team developed a set of climate
change scenarios for New York State. Figure OV-1, from ClimAID, shows the projected changes
in average annual temperature and precipitation for New York for a mid-level emission scenario
of future greenhouse gas emissions. A synthesis report summarizing the findings of ClimAID
can be found in Appendix H to the Interim Report.

baseline

Many climate changes projected by scientists are already occurring, with impacts to New York
State’s society, economy, and natural ecosystems. The
summaries presented here by sector list some of the
expected specific impacts to New York State as the climate
continues to change.
Agriculture
Some crops may have yield or quality losses associated
with increased frequency of drought, increased summer
high temperatures, increased risk of freeze injury as a result
of more variable winters, and increased pressure from
weeds, insects, and disease. Dairy milk production per cow
will decline in the region as temperatures and the frequency

freezes and other weather aberrations that

Interim Report 11-9-10

of summer heat stress increase. Warmer temperatures, a longer growing season, and increased
atmospheric carbon dioxide could create opportunities for farmers who are able to transition to
new crops.
Coastal Zones
Sea level rise will greatly amplify risks to coastal populations and will lead to permanent
inundation of low-lying areas, more frequent flooding by storm surges, and increased beach
erosion. Saltwater could reach farther up the Hudson River and into estuaries, contaminating
urban water supplies. Tides and storm surges may propagate farther up the Hudson River,
increasing flood risk far from the coast.
Ecosystems
Widespread shifts in species composition will occur
in the state's forests and other natural landscapes,
with the loss of spruce-fir forests, alpine tundra, and
boreal plant communities. Warmer temperatures
will favor the expansion of some invasive species
into New York. Some habitat and food generalists
(such as white-tailed deer) may also benefit. Higher
levels of carbon dioxide may increase the growth
rate of fast-growing species, which are often weeds

increasingly vulnerable to changes in the timing,
supply, and intensity of rainfall and snowmelt, groundwater recharge, and duration of ice cover.
Increasing water temperatures will negatively affect brook trout and other native coldwater fish.
Sea level rise will lead to loss of coastal wetlands, reducing populations of fish and shellfish.
Energy Systems
More frequent heat waves will cause an increase in the use of air conditioning, stressing power
supplies and increasing peak demand loads. Transformers and distribution lines for both electric
and gas supply are vulnerable to extreme weather events, temperature, and flooding. Coastal
infrastructure in downstate areas is vulnerable to flooding as a result of sea level rise and severe
storms. Hydropower is vulnerable to drought and changes in precipitation patterns while power
plant efficiencies may be reduced due to increased air and water temperatures.
Public Health
Heat-related illness and death are projected to increase, while cold-related deaths will likely
decrease. Increases in heat-related death are projected to outweigh reductions in cold-related
death. Cardiovascular and respiratory-related illness and death will be increased by worsening air
quality, including more smog, wildfires, pollens, and molds. Allergy and asthma cases are
projected to increase and become more severe. Vector-borne diseases, such as those spread by
mosquitoes and ticks, may expand or their distribution patterns may change. Water- and foodborne diseases are likely to increase. Water supply, recreational water quality, and food
production will be at increased risk due to increased temperatures and changing precipitation

Interim Report 11-9-10

patterns. More intense storms and flooding could lead to increased stress and mental health
impacts and impaired delivery of public health and medical services. Demand for health services
and the need for public health surveillance and monitoring are likely to increase.
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure
Communication service delivery is vulnerable to hurricanes, lightning, ice, snow, wind storms,
and other extreme weather events, some of which are projected to change in frequency and/or
intensity. Communication lines and other infrastructure are vulnerable to the observed and
projected increase in heavy precipitation events and resulting flooding and/or freezing rain. In
coastal and near-coastal areas, sea level rise in combination with coastal storm surge flooding
will be a considerable threat especially later this century. The delivery of communication
services is reliant on the electric power grid, which may experience increased stress resulting
from the additional demand associated with heat waves.
Transportation
Low-lying transportation systems such as subways and tunnels, especially in coastal and nearcoastal areas, are at particular risk of flooding as a
result of sea level rise and heavy-precipitation events.
Materials used in transportation infrastructure, such
as asphalt and train rails, are vulnerable to increased
temperatures and frequency of extreme heat events.
The Great Lakes may see a shorter season of winter
ice cover, leading to a longer shipping season.
However, reduced ice cover is also likely to mean an
increase in “lake effect” snow events, which often
cause transportation-related problems. Air- and landbased transportation systems are vulnerable to ice
and snowstorms, although requirements for salting

winter temperatures rise.
Water Resources
Increasing water temperatures in rivers and streams will affect aquatic health and reduce the
capacity of streams to assimilate effluent from wastewater treatment plants. Heavy downpours
have increased over the past 50 years and this trend is projected to continue, causing an increase
in localized flash flooding in urban areas and hilly regions. Flooding has the potential to increase
pollutants in the water supply and inundate wastewater treatment plants and other vulnerable
development within floodplains. At the same time as downpours occur more often, more
moderate rain events are expected to become less frequent during the summer, resulting in
additional and possibly longer summer dry periods and stressing water supply systems with
limited storage. Reduced summer flows on large rivers and lowered groundwater tables could
lead to conflicts among competing water users.

Economic Impacts
The economic cost associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation is a growing
concern for national, state, and local governments around the world. While the cost of combating
climate change often impedes action on this threat, inaction has its own significant costs.
Some economic sectors in New York State are more at risk from climate change than others.
Because of heavy concentrations of assets in coastal areas, the largest financial impacts likely
will occur there, including impacts on transportation, energy, and other coastal infrastructure, as
well as natural areas. Other likely costs include decreased agricultural crop yield and dairy
production, as well as tourism dollars lost in the winter-recreation industry.

5.0 New York State's GHG Emissions
Emission inventories and projections provide the basis for identifying GHG emissions reduction
opportunities and for planning to minimize the economic and environmental impacts of policies.
New York’s Emissions Inventory
In 2005, the latest year for which global emissions data
are available, New York’s share of emissions within the
U.S. (3.8 percent) was smaller than its share of the U.S.
population (6.5 percent). In contrast, the U.S. share of the
world’s GHG emissions (18 percent) was much greater
than its share of the 2005 population (4.6 percent).
Nonetheless, New York’s GHG emissions accounted for
0.7 percent of the world’s GHG emissions in 2005, while
its share of global population was 0.3 percent.
In 2008, New York emitted approximately 254 million
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), an
average of a little more than 13 metric tons of CO2e for
each state resident. New York’s per capita GHG
emissions are considerably (43 percent) below the U.S.
average.

Carbon Dioxide
Equivalent (CO2e)
Because GHGs vary in their
ability to retain heat, GHG
emission inventories and
projections are given in the
metric CO2e. CO2e expresses
any GHG’s global warming
potential as a multiple of the
potential of carbon dioxide
(CO2).
For instance, methane has a
CO2e of approximately 22 –
that is, methane in the
atmosphere produces about 22
times as much warming as the
same weight of CO2.

For each of the six major GHGs, Figure OV-2 depicts the
portions of New York’s emissions that result from fuel
combustion and from other sources. Prominent non-fuel
combustion GHG sources are cement production, ozone depleting substitutes, natural gas
leakage, landfills, agricultural animals, municipal waste combustion, municipal wastewater, and
agricultural soil management.

CO2 = carbon dioxide; GHG = greenhouse gas

As Figure OV-2 shows, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the predominant GHG emitted in New York
(88 percent, including both combustion and non-combustion emissions). Methane is second
(6 percent); most of New York’s methane results from non-fuel combustion sources such as
municipal waste and natural gas leakage. The state’s small amounts of nitrous oxide emissions
(2 percent of total emissions) are mostly attributable to automotive fuel combustion. Other
industrial gases make up the remaining GHG emissions.
Combustion of fossil fuels is the dominant source CO2 emissions—CO2 from fuel combustion
makes up 84 percent of New York’s GHG emissions. Fossil fuel combustion occurs in power
plants to generate electricity, on building sites for space heat and industrial process power, and in
vehicles to transport goods and people.
Carbon Dioxide Emissions from the Major Economic Sectors
The GHG inventory divides CO2 emissions into four main end-use sectors: industrial, residential,
commercial/institutional, and transportation. The emissions inventories for the residential,
commercial/institutional, and industrial sectors include the emissions resulting from each
sector’s share of electricity generation, whereas the Climate Action Plan policy option analysis
separates out electricity sector emissions because they must be mitigated within the power
supply and distribution sector.
Figure OV-3 details 2008 CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion by end-use sector. The
transportation sector accounts for approximately 40 percent of CO2 emissions from fuel
combustion; the residential and commercial/institutional sectors are each responsible for roughly
25 percent of fuel combustion CO2 emissions, including emissions from the share of electricity
generation required by each of these sectors. The residential sector shows greater emissions from
fuel combustion on-site than from electricity generation or imported electricity, while the
commercial/institutional sector shows the reverse—emissions from electricity generation and
imported electricity are higher than emissions from on-site fuel combustion. The industrial
sector’s fuel combustion CO2 emissions are the lowest (approximately 10 percent), with most of
these emissions coming from on-site fuel combustion.

CO2 = carbon dioxide; GHG = greenhouse gas.

Of the different fuels, natural gas, which is burned in all fuel combustion sectors, accounts for
the largest amount of fuel combustion CO2 emissions (almost 30 percent). The transportation
sector emits nearly as much fuel combustion CO2 (28 percent), from burning gasoline in
vehicles.
Trends in Emissions and GHG Sinks
New York’s gross GHG emissions increased by about 2 percent (or 6 million metric tons of
CO2e) between 1990 and 2008, with a peak around the year 2000. New York’s transportation
sector showed by far the greatest growth in gross GHG emissions, with an annual increase of 14
million metric tons from 1990 to 2008. In contrast, during this same period annual CO2e
emissions from electricity generated in-state decreased by about 18 million metric tons, although
emissions associated with electricity imported from other states grew.
It should be noted that gross emission figures do not take into account uptake of carbon by GHG
sinks, while net emissions do. New York’s forests, including urban forests, wetlands, and fields,
function as sinks of CO2 emissions. Agricultural cultivation practices also are found to contribute
to removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Forecast through 2030
Relying on a variety of sources for forecasts (as described in Chapter 3 of the full Interim Report
on Inventory and Forecast), a reference case forecast of GHG emissions through 2030 was
developed. The reference case assumes implementation of policies that are currently approved

OV-13

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

and funded at the state and federal level. It assumes no additional policy action, and is sometimes
referred to as a “business-as-usual” scenario.
Figure OV-4 shows estimates of annual GHG emissions through 2030 (based on forecasts for
Mid-Atlantic fuel demand, along with natural gas projections). Forecasts for on-highway diesel
and gasoline fuel use were based on forecasts of New York vehicle miles of travel provided by
the Department of Transportation and federal projections of vehicle fuel economy. The forecasts
do not take into account the effects of a changing climate.

Under the reference case forecasts, New York’s gross GHG emissions decrease slightly from
2005 over the forecast period, to about 268 million tons of CO2e by 2030, or 8 percent above
1990 levels. Relative to 2005, the shares of 2030 emissions associated with residential,
commercial/institutional and industrial sector fuel use, transportation, and power supply and
delivery are still the highest, in the same order. The greatest increase in the share of emissions is
in the transportation sector, with an increase from 29 percent of total gross emissions in 2005 to
33 percent in 2030.
Growth rates of fuel use for space heating, industrial processes, transportation, and electricity
demand, the principal determinants of New York’s future GHG emissions, are driven by
economic, demographic, and land-use trends, which are difficult to predict. Improving forecasts
of growth patterns and transportation system impacts will be a crucial task for climate planners
going forward.

6.0 Visioning
New York’s 2050 Analysis
The 80 by 50 goal and the year 2050 vision drive New York’s Climate Action Plan. In the 2050
vision, with GHG emissions at only 20 percent of today’s level, New York would boast a vibrant
economy, its resilient communities and natural resources meeting citizens’ needs in a changing
climate and thriving as the nation’s and the world’s low-carbon economy matures.
To give definition and specificity to this 2050 vision, the Climate Action Council conducted a
visioning exercise. The visioning exercise made use of four tools:
•

2050 Scenario development, based on a coupled energy-sector model and sets of
assumptions about future energy demand, patterns of energy use, and low-emission
technologies that might reasonably be available to power the low-carbon economy

•

Visioning workshop, held at the New York Academy of Sciences on January 5, 2010; full
session and presentations available online at http://nyclimatechange.us/2050

•

White paper incorporating workshop outcomes and information from other expert sources:
Envisioning a Low-Carbon 2050 for New York State, Brookhaven National Laboratory
(Appendix F).

•

2050 Sectoral visions developed by the
Technical Work Groups for each sector
of New York’s economy: Residential,
Commercial/Institutional and Industrial
(buildings and processes); Power
Supply and Delivery; Transportation
and Land Use; Agriculture, Forestry,
and Waste (with Materials
Management). Detailed discussions of
the visions for each sector are part of the
mitigation sector chapters of this Interim
Report.

This visioning exercise led to the following
key findings:

The City of Syracuse, a Climate Smart Community, sets an
example and achieves GHG reduction by partnering in a car
sharing program through which residents rent low-emission
hybrid vehicles for short time periods. (Photo courtesy of
City of Syracuse)

•

Meeting the 80 by 50 goal will require substantial investments in new energy systems and
infrastructure that have very low- or zero-net carbon emissions. Changes in patterns of
energy use also will be needed.

•

Transportation systems and buildings (residential and commercial) will have to move away
from reliance on combustion of fossil fuels to alternate sources with significantly lower
carbon or no carbon emissions.

•

A broad shift from reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity to carbon-free low- or zerocarbon sources will be needed with a concurrent increase in energy storage and generation
capacity. Local fossil fuel combustion yields to electrification and other alternate
technologies.

OV-15

Interim Report 11-9-10

•

Energy efficiency must be aggressively pursued today, but it alone is not sufficient to achieve
New York’s 80 by 50 GHG emission reduction goal.

•

Development and redevelopment based on smart
growth principles, along with efficient building design
practices, building technologies, and construction
methods, can significantly reduce the energy demand
for buildings and transportation.

•

An informed and engaged citizenry that values wise,
efficient use of clean energy as part of their everyday
lives is absolutely critical to achieving New York’s 80
by 50 goal. The goal must be pursued in part through
extensive, long-term partnering among all levels of
government and across the region, and between the
public and private sectors. It will take sustained,
unprecedented effort on the part of all.

7.0 Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Options
The Technical Work Groups explored policy options to reduce GHG emissions in four key
energy-related sectors of New York’s economy, as shown in Figure OV-5: Power Supply and
Delivery; Residential, Commercial/Institutional and Industrial; Transportation and Land Use;
and Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste. The Technical Work Groups developed policy options
after reviewing technologies and projections of future demand and screening a large number of
possible State policies. As the figure shows, the policy options target all the core 80 by 50
strategies developed in the visioning process.

Interim Report 11-9-10

Figure OV-5 lists the policy options by sector (each option is designated throughout the Interim
Report by a combination of sector initials and numbers). Greater detail about the policy options
is available in the Interim Report mitigation chapters (Chapters 6 through 9). Evaluating policy
option effectiveness, their net cost and the interactions among them, and selecting policies for
final recommendations to the Governor, will be the work of the second phase of New York’s
Climate Action Plan.
Analyzing Cost and Potential Emission Reductions from the Policy Options
Where possible, the cost and/or savings associated with a policy and the total GHG emissions
expected by the 2030 benchmark year were quantified. The 1990 baseline emission levels
(referenced in Executive Order 24), along with current levels, are presented in Figure OV-6. The
2030 forecasted GHG emission level, 268 million metric tons (MMtCO2e ), is also presented,
along with the emission limits implied by the 2030 benchmark target (148 MMtCO2e ) and the
2050 goal (50 MMtCO2e ). The required emission reduction for 2030 is therefore 120 MMtCO2e,
as shown in Figure OV-6. While the precise pathway to the 80 by 50 goal cannot be known, the
benchmark goal does provide a plausible mid-point target for the purpose of policy evaluation.

Figure OV-7 presents quantitative analysis of the Interim Report’s mitigation policy options over
the study period (2011-2030). The preliminary analytical results presented here describe the
potential effectiveness of the mitigation policy options on a stand-alone basis, without
considering interactions among policies or overlapping emissions reductions. Figure OV-7
presents an estimate of the annual GHG emission reduction anticipated by 2030 of the individual
policy options (i.e., as measured by Million Metric Tons CO2e). To make this estimate, the
Technical Work Groups developed specific targets (policy scenarios), where possible, for
OV-18

New York State Climate Action Council

individual policy options. (Note that not all policy options are amenable to this type of
quantification.) The results also present an estimate of the total cost or savings of the policy
option through 2030, as measured by net present value (NPV). NPV reflects the total capital
costs, anticipated operation and maintenance costs/savings, and fuel costs/savings associated
with the policy. A negative NPV reflects a savings and implies an economically desirable
investment. Figure OV-7 also presents a rough indicator of cost-effectiveness for the policy
option, as measured by $/ton CO2e avoided, to determine which policy options will deliver the
most CO2e on a dollar-for-dollar basis. As with NPV, a negative $/ton CO2e implies that we save
money as we reduce GHGs.
While further analysis is needed to better understand the full range of economic impacts and to
eliminate potential overlap, some general observations can be made from the analysis to date:
•

No single policy can deliver the level of emission reduction needed to achieve a 40 by 30
target. A portfolio of policies will be needed to reduce emissions from the many different
GHG sources throughout our economy.

•

A linear path to achieving 80 by 50 may not be feasible nor optimal for a state like New
York, which is already one of the most carbon-efficient states in the country on a per capita
basis. We may need to ratchet up the stringency of the policies over time to increase the rate
of emission reduction as technologies and markets mature.

•

There are a number of policies—particularly in the Buildings, Industry, and Transportation
sectors—that represent cost-effective ways to take a meaningful step toward a low-carbon
future. These No Regrets policies, which are primarily efficiency policies, could represent
options for early action. Further analysis of benefits and costs, and strategies to finance
and/or fund, will be needed.

•

Energy efficiency policies alone, however, will not deliver the level of emission reduction
needed to achieve a 40 by 30 target (and ultimately the 80 by 50 goal). To make appreciable
progress toward these aggressive goals and to break our dependence on finite fossil-fuel
resources, the State will need to continue to strategically advance low-carbon energy supplyside policies and infrastructure investments, particularly focusing on policies that provide
significant co-benefits to New Yorkers (e.g., improvements in local air and water quality,
opportunities for economic development and job creation).

The data presented in Figure OV-7 are also illustrated in Figure OV-8. Figure OV-8 shows the
potential annual emission reductions in 2030 and the net-savings or net-cost per ton CO2e
avoided for each policy. The 2030 benchmark goal has been drawn as a line in the figure to
provide a basis for judging effectiveness of each policy. Some general observations can be
provided:
•

Policies that provide the largest potential emission reductions in 2030 include the low-carbon
fuel standard for vehicle fuels (TLU-4), increased vehicle fuel efficiency and/or CO2
emission standards (TLU-1), building energy efficiency incentives (RCI-2), and a low-carbon
portfolio standard for electricity generation (PSD-6).

•

Polices that provide the largest savings per avoided metric ton of emissions include smart
growth policies (TLU-9, -10, and -11) and commuter assistance (TLU-6).

•

Policies that provide both significant emission reductions and net savings include building
energy efficiency incentives (RCI-2), improved building codes, appliance standards, and
enforcement (RCI-7), and vehicle incentives (TLU-2).

The Interim Report also presents estimates of fuels savings associated with these policies, where
appropriate. Based on the estimated reductions in 2030 derived from the policy option and on
current consumption levels, RCI-2 would save enough electricity to power 4.6 million homes
and enough home heating oil and natural gas to heat more than 1.9 million homes for a year.
Similarly, based on the estimated reductions in 2030 derived from the scenario analysis and on
current consumption levels, TLU-1 would save enough motor gasoline to power 7.3 million cars
for a year.

Interim Report 11-9-10

7.1 Residential, Commercial/Institutional and Industrial Sector (RCI)
RCI Sector Vision for 2050
New Yorkers will enjoy safe, comfortable, well-functioning, and sustainable buildings and
communities whose construction and renovation activities, building operations, and industrial
processes are designed and operated to maximize energy and resource efficiency, to minimize
fossil fuel inputs, and to meet remaining energy needs from a mix of local low-carbon resources
and low-carbon imports.
Reaching the Vision: Transforming the
Residential, Commercial/Institutional, and
Industrial Sector
To reduce GHG emissions 80 percent by 2050, New
York’s residential, commercial/institutional, and
industrial buildings and industrial processes will need
to adopt technologies, management efficiencies, and
operational practices that support maximum energy
and resource efficiency, while substituting low- and
zero-carbon sources for fossil fuel in meeting their
remaining energy needs.

The City of Schenectady is sponsoring
construction of affordable, highly efficient homes
to replace deteriorating buildings.

New York has instituted policies that will provide the clean electricity needed for the reduced
energy needs of efficient buildings and industrial processes; for example, the 45 by 15 clean
energy policy challenges the state to reduce electricity end-use in 2015 by 15 percent below
forecasted levels, while simultaneously meeting 30 percent of electricity supply needs through
renewable resources. While these policies are among the most progressive in the country, they
barely begin to address the level of GHG reduction needed in RCI to achieve the State’s 80 by 50
goal.
RCI Policy Options

Long Island Green Homes is an energy efficiency retrofit
program created by the Town of Babylon. This program is
saving residents an average of $1,085 per year on utility
bills by providing upfront funds to upgrade insulation,
boilers, furnaces, water heaters, ventilation, air sealing,
ducts and weatherstripping. (Photo courtesy of Town of
Babylon LIGH Program)

The Technical Work Group identified ten key
policy options with the potential to transition
New York’s buildings and industrial sector to
use significantly less energy, improve resource
efficiency, and reduce fossil fuel inputs, with
additional energy supplied from low- or zerocarbon imports. Chapter 6 of this Interim Report
gives technical information, specific targets, and
preliminary estimates of cost and effectiveness
for each policy option based on the 2030
benchmark; more definitive economic analyses
will be developed during the next planning
phase.

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

Figure OV-9. RCI Policy Options with Brief Descriptions
RCI Policy Options and Descriptions
Building Codes, Appliance Standards, and Enforcement (RCI-7)
Establish more aggressive codes regarding energy use, including movement to performancebased codes.
Provide a statewide “stretch code” that encourages municipalities to achieve additional savings
and informs the building sector of planned future changes.
Continue to establish and update energy efficiency performance standards for products that
are not federally preempted, as specified under Article 16 of the Energy Law, and lobby the
federal government to increase performance standards for those appliances with federal
preemption.
Building Commissioning, Benchmarking, and Upgrades (RCI- 8)
Measure and provide information about buildings’ energy use, increasing incentive to reduce
energy consumption.
Require regular energy audits and cost-effective energy efficiency measures.
Energy Efficiency Incentives (RCI-2)
Provide incentives and resources for greater energy efficiency in new buildings and better
energy performance in existing buildings. Employ whole-building integrated analysis and
design to identify high performance efficiency measures.
Customer-Sited Renewable Energy Incentives (RCI-3)
Provide incentives and resources for greater penetration of solar electricity, solar thermal, and
low-carbon bioenergy solutions.
Industrial Process Incentives (RCI-11)
Assess and reduce industrial process energy use. Provide funding and resources to reduce
GHG emissions per unit of industrial production.
Workforce Training and Development (RCI-6)
Assess and develop workforce capabilities in New York to meet the needs of a low-carbon
future.
Education, Outreach, and Behavior Change (RCI-5)
Change energy use behaviors by affecting retail purchase patterns, education in schools,
increasing New York State government lead-by-example, and providing information and
resources to New York State communities and individuals.
Rate Restructuring and Flexible Metering (RCI-10)
Redesign electric rates to vary by time-of-use for all electricity users and expand installation of
meters that provide real-time electric cost/use information.
Research, Development, and Demonstration (RCI-9)
Invest in next-generation technologies that will produce lower cost solutions to achieve climateenergy goals in the RCI sector and advance a clean energy economy in New York State.
Efficiency and Clean Energy Fund (RCI-1)
Fund efficiency and clean energy programs that reduce GHG emissions; build on existing
funding sources and explore expanding to include all fuels.
Tax Structure and Private Financing (RCI-4)
Conduct a two-phase comprehensive financing and tax policy review that will indentify changes
needed to support GHG emission reduction and encourage both public and private investment
in low-carbon energy.

OV-24

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

How the RCI Policy Options Would Work
At the core of the RCI policies are two statutory and regulatory policies that will produce longterm emission reductions in code-compliant new and renovated existing buildings: Building
Codes, Appliance Standards, and Enforcement (RCI-7), and Building Commissioning,
Benchmarking, and Upgrades (RCI-8). By promoting upgraded building envelopes and
equipment, furnished with energy-saving appliances governed by State or federal energy
efficiency performance standards, these policies will reduce building operating costs and achieve
substantial energy savings and emission reductions.
Because the RCI policy options do not require most
existing buildings to undergo code-mandated
improvements, incentives for voluntary upgrades
will be vital to meeting New York’s GHG emission
reduction goals. It is important to note that by 2030,
the total building stock in New York State is not
expected to increase by more than 6 percent.
Therefore, reducing emissions from existing
buildings will be absolutely critical to reducing
emissions from this sector.
Energy Efficiency Incentives (RCI-2) would
promote whole-building, integrated analysis to
identify high performance efficiency measures for
existing and new buildings. Customer-Sited
Renewable Energy Incentives (RCI-3) would
increase use of onsite renewable energy, and
Industrial Process Incentives (RCI-11) would enhance industrial activity and reduce carbon
intensity through more efficient, productive, and cost-effective operations.

Smart Community of Red Hook are reducing power
bills so successfully that the town has applied to

improvement projects for other local government
facilities. (Photo courtesy of Town of Red Hook)

Six supporting policies promote developments that are critical to successful statutory and
voluntary emissions reduction in buildings, including developing a workforce with the
knowledge, skills, and ability to directly meet the energy service demands driven by other RCI
policies (RCI-6), and investing in next-generation technologies that will produce lower cost
solutions to achieve climate-energy goals
(RCI-9).
Consumers play a key role in investing in
energy efficiency and renewable energy
equipment and infrastructure. Education,
Outreach, and Behavior Change (RCI-5)
will promote consumer and State agency
staff awareness of the benefits of clean
energy and energy efficiency. Redesign
of electric rates to vary by time-of-use for
most electricity users, along with
expanded installation of “smart” meters

Weatherizing buildings reduces building heating/cooling needs
and GHG emissions, and also provides employment to local
workers.

that provide real-time information about electricity consumption and cost, would provide more
effective price signals reflecting time-of-use and the GHG burden of source fuels, enabling
customers to reduce electricity consumption, and save money in Rate Restructuring and Flexible
Metering (RCI-10).
Dedicated and continuous funding is essential for the overall success of the RCI policy options
and attainment of long-term carbon reduction goals. An Energy Efficiency and Clean Energy
Fund (RCI-1) and Tax Structure and Private Financing (RCI-4) initiatives would work in unison
to leverage public funding and private financing for low-carbon energy activities. Figure OV-10
illustrates how the RCI policies cover all aspects of a developing low-carbon RCI sector to
accomplish significant GHG emission reductions.
Figure OV-10. Residential, Commercial/Institutional, and Industrial Policy Framework

The next phase of climate action planning will evaluate policy interactions, preparing the way for
policymakers to select, design, and efficiently implement policies that will avoid conflicting
outcomes and make the most of beneficial interactions.

7.2 Transportation and Land Use Sector (TLU)
TLU Sector Vision for 2050
Most New Yorkers will live in smart growth communities and have access to an efficient,
reliable, extensive transit network with a variety of modes of low-carbon public and mass
transportation within and between communities. Smart Growth will be the predominant land use
and development pattern, minimizing GHG emissions by 1) enabling and supporting widespread
use of public transit and 2) mixing land uses to minimize the need for driving. Individuals will
travel in low-carbon, highly efficient vehicles powered by electricity, hydrogen fuel cells, or
sustainably derived biofuels. A significant portion of freight will move on low-carbon modes like
rail and barge; trucks will become more efficient and use alternative fuels.
Getting to the Vision: Transforming the Transportation and Land Use Sector
A low-carbon transportation future for New York requires transforming all factors that determine
GHG emissions when people and goods are transported: vehicles, fuels, travel activity, and
transportation system efficiency. The TLU policies deal with both transportation and land use—
deployment of new transportation technologies, provision of new transit choices, and adoption of
land use patterns that allow people to meet their daily needs with less vehicle travel.
TLU Policy Options

Rochelle)

The Technical Work Group identified 12
Transportation and Land Use policy options with the
potential to guide a transition to a low-carbon
transportation system. Chapter 7 of the full Interim
Report gives technical information, specific targets,
and preliminary estimates of cost and effectiveness
for each policy option based on the 2030 benchmark;
more definitive economic analysis will be developed
during the next planning phase.

TLU Policy Options and Descriptions
Research, Development and Demonstration (TLU-5)
Invest in next-generation technologies that will produce lower cost solutions to achieve climateenergy goals in the TLU sector and advance a clean energy economy in New York State.
Travel Demand Management and Transportation Systems Management (TLU-6)
Implement measures that reduce dependency on vehicles, encourage and facilitate the use of
shared modes of transportation, and allow for the more efficient use of vehicles.
Transit and High Speed Rail (TLU-7)
Invest in the maintenance, enhancement, and expansion of public transit systems, including
high speed rail.
Freight Strategies that Promote GHG Reductions (TLU-8)
Invest in freight rail infrastructure, and research and implement the optimal freight system;
provide other incentives for freight mode-shift; promote more efficient or alternatively fueled
trucks.
Priority Growth Centers (TLU-9)
Promote centralized growth to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT).
Transit Oriented Development (TOD)/Transit Supportive Development (TSD) (TLU-10)
Promote growth where transit is available to provide transportation choices and reduce VMT.
Location Efficient Land Use (TLU-11)
Implement mixed-use, smart growth land-use, and planning policies that result in communities
that require less driving.
Intergovernmental/Regional Proposals (TLU-12)
Coordinate regional initiatives, including multi-state land use planning incentives, multi-state
transportation system GHG allowance system, coordination of high speed rail planning and
investment, and federal advocacy.

How the TLU Policy Options Would Work
The policy options identified by the technical work group would seek to influence the future mix
of technologies in New York’s fleet of vehicles (low-carbon vehicles, or vehicle efficiency) and
the fuels used (low-carbon fuels, or fuel GHG emission intensity), and would aim to reduce total
vehicle-miles travelled and system energy loss (travel activity/system efficiency). Vehicle Miles
Traveled, or VMT, is a key measure of travel activity and transportation system efficiency—a
smaller VMT means a more efficient system. Figure OV-12 portrays the relationships among
transportation and land use policy options.

7.3 Power Supply and Delivery Sector (PSD)
PSD Sector Vision for 2050
New York will have a safe, reliable, diverse, and extremely low-emitting electric power system
that meets the needs of all citizens and accommodates the widespread conversion of buildings
and transportation from fossil fuel to electricity in a manner that maximizes societal benefits,
minimizes societal costs, and avoids imposing an undue burden on any community.
Getting to the Vision: Transforming the Power Supply and Delivery Sector
Reducing GHG emissions 80 percent by 2050 economy-wide means that by mid-century, close
to 100 percent of New York’s electricity must come from low-carbon sources—sources with
near zero-carbon emissions. Existing State policies have begun this crucial transformation: by
2015, the State’s electricity grid is expected to be powered 60 percent by renewable or other lowcarbon sources, as a result of the 30-percent renewable energy from the renewable portfolio
standard combined with the 30 percent of power currently provided by nuclear power plants. By
2018, the current RGGI cap requires electric power sector emissions to be 10 percent below
historic levels. However, these existing programs alone cannot reach the 80 by 50 goal.

OV-29

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

PSD Policy Options
The Technical Work Group identified nine policy options with potential to transition power
supply and delivery from its current status of more than 50 percent essentially carbon-free
sources (including nuclear, hydroelectric, and other renewable power) to nearly 100 percent.
This transition will require substantial investments to maintain system reliability. Chapter 8 of
this Interim Report gives technical information, specific targets, and preliminary estimates of
cost and effectiveness for each policy option based on the 2030 benchmark; more definitive
economic analyses will be developed during the next planning phase.

Interim Report 11-9-10

Figure OV-14. Power Supply and Delivery (PSD) Policy Options

How the Power Supply and Delivery Policy Options Would Work
Three policy options would lead to most of the emission reductions from the electricity sector:
•

Extension and expansion of the State’s existing Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), a
policy that seeks to increase the proportion of renewable electricity delivered to retail
customers. The expanded RPS will more than double by 2030 the amount of electricity
provided by new renewable energy, including off-shore wind energy and solar energy. The
policy also would include complementary measures providing early support to bring lowcarbon renewable sources on line.

•

A low-carbon portfolio standard that will build on the RPS, requiring regulated utilities
and other load-serving entities to procure an increasing amount of low-carbon energy.

•

Building upon and strengthening the RGGI program, working with New York’s regional
partners to convert RGGI into a multi-sector cap-and-invest program that caps and reduces
carbon emissions region-wide, sets a price on carbon emissions, and invests proceeds from
allowance auctions in building the clean energy economy in New York.

The remaining policy options focus on lowering emissions from fossil-fueled power generation,
modernizing the electric grid, and advancing technology to cost-effectively build the clean
energy economy.

OV-31

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

•

To ensure relatively low emissions from existing or new fossil-fired plants by 2030, State
policies initially can facilitate siting of new lower carbon power-generating facilities and
ensure that all new plants meet a GHG emission standard based on the performance of
modern, efficient natural gas-fired plants. After 2030, existing plants also would meet lower
emission levels; incentives would
encourage the repowering or replacement
of older plants with more efficient, loweremitting technology earlier than 2030.

•

To ensure electricity grid reliability
when drawing increasingly on renewable
and other low-carbon power sources,
policy options include extensions and
upgrades to the electricity distribution
system, along with continued deployment
of smart grid technologies. These grid

sources and electric vehicles, as well as

efficient transmission from new renewable
and low-carbon generation facilities to areas of high demand. Additional energy storage will
help accommodate the variability that characterizes most renewable electricity sources.

•

To cost-effectively transition to a low-carbon power sector, policy options emphasize
continued investment in research, development, demonstration, and deployment. Options for
Technology Research and Development are detailed in Chapter 10 of this Interim Report.

The next phase of climate action planning will evaluate any interactions among these policies,
preparing the way for policymakers to select, design, and efficiently implement policies that will
avoid conflicting outcomes and make the most of beneficial interactions.

7.4 Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Sectors (AFW)
AFW Sector Vision for 2050
Agriculture: A carbon-negative New York agricultural sector will help to meet the state’s food
and fiber needs, while also making a significant contribution to the energy supply mix. Farms
will be profitable, valued by society, and highly adapted to a changing climate. Farms will be
managed as multiple-resource concerns, successfully competing in a fossil-fuel dependent world
that is undergoing major climate shifts.
Forests: Rural forest land conversion will be rare and long-term forest storage of carbon will
realize its maximum potential. Urban green space and trees will reduce building heating and
cooling loads. Working together, land owners, government officials, and the public will
maximize the long-term carbon sequestration and bio-energy potential of the state’s forests.
Forests will deliver co-benefits that are vital to the economy and to New Yorkers’ quality of life,
maximizing the value of forest lands to private forest owners and to the public.

OV-32

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

Waste: New York will have a sustainable and energy-efficient materials economy where
environmental stewardship is pursued as a common societal value and where environmental
considerations inform purchasing, production, and materials management, minimizing waste
and reducing risks to human health and the environment. Materials management systems and
infrastructure will maximize the recovery and re-use of water, wastewater, and other materials
in ways that capture their economic value, conserve embedded energy, and minimize net lifecycle emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.
Getting to the Vision: Transforming the Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Sector

(Manhasset School District, shown here), libraries and parks
with a vigorous recycling program. Recycled materials do
not require energy-intensive disposal, and re-manufacturing
takes less energy than using virgin materials. (Photo

The agriculture, forestry, and waste sectors all
involve management and stewardship of
resources. These sectors contribute only a
small portion of total state GHG emissions
(about 6 percent), but offer potential for
relatively low-cost and low-technology GHG
mitigation and sequestration policies. Policy
options in the agriculture, forestry, and waste
sectors would add GHG reduction as a goal of
managing energy production and use, natural
resources, materials management and waste.
Intensive resource management offers
significant environmental, economic, and
social benefits beyond GHG reductions,
including improved water and air quality,
increased agricultural and forest productivity,
and job creation.

AFW Policy Options
The Technical Work Group identified eight Agriculture, Forests, and Waste policy options with
the potential to develop economically vibrant resource and materials management in New York,
with sustainable production of food, fiber and fuel; energy-efficient operation; maximum GHG
sequestration; and effective stewardship of New York’s soils, natural resources, materials, and
energy. Chapter 9 of this Interim Report gives technical information and preliminary estimates of
cost and effectiveness for each policy option based on the 2030 benchmark; more definitive
economic analysis will be developed during the next planning phase.

sequester additional carbon, reduce fossil fuel energy consumption, and increase green
infrastructure.
Locally Produced Food (AFW-8)
Increase the availability of locally produced foods to help reduce the energy required for
transportation, packaging and marketing.

How the AFW Policy Options Would Work
Overall, the policy options seek to accomplish the following:
•

Reduce energy-related emissions through the deployment of renewable energy technologies,
including low-carbon bio-based energy solutions, and energy efficiency policies and
measures that address direct and embedded energy usage.

•

Conserve the embedded energy in materials by maximizing reuse and recycling.

•

Reduce emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, both potent GHGs, from agricultural and
waste-related activities by deploying a combination of systems.

•

Capitalize on the large carbon storage capability of agriculture and forests, which sequester
carbon from the atmosphere via natural processes.

•

Coordinate climate change adaptation strategies with mitigation strategies wherever possible.

8.0 Research, Development, and Demonstration Investments for a
Low-Carbon Future
Experts are calling for a three-to-five-fold increase in global public and private investment in
energy technology research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) to develop lower cost
solutions to the climate-energy challenge and to capitalize on the opportunities associated with
new energy markets. This recommendation is strongly supported by a range of stakeholders
including business leaders, academic leaders, the National Academy of Sciences, and the United
Nations.
New York’s Climate Action Plan must include a commitment to promote and support RD&D, in
a coordinated partnership with the federal government and the private sector, to ensure continual
development of innovative technologies necessary to cost-effectively reduce GHG emissions and
promote the economic strength of local clean energy businesses. Statewide RD&D investments,

OV-35

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

across all economic sectors, must be targeted to provide demonstrable benefits for New York
companies.
Development of this RD&D investment strategy represents a critical follow-on task that will
build upon the high-level policy options in this Interim Report. The investment strategy will
further define New York’s technological strengths, establish multi-disciplinary collaborative
teams between universities and industry, and identify opportunities to further leverage limited instate resources with federal and private sector funds.
Chapter 10 in the Interim Report provides an overview of the
RD&D needs of the four mitigation sectors, identifies technology
areas where New York can best leverage its investments and
capabilities to benefit local businesses, and presents “order-ofmagnitude” funding estimates to support a technical innovation
network and advance low-carbon technologies. It is expected that
any State-funded RD&D program established to support
implementation of New York’s 80 by 50 goal would be supported
by a broad array of public stakeholders throughout the state – with
active private sector involvement.
The New York Battery and Energy
Storage Technology Consortium
(NY-BEST™) is a private-public
coalition building a vibrant, worldclass advanced battery and energy
storage sector from R&D to
commercialization.

The Interim Report provides the following observations and
recommendations:
• RD&D and innovation are responsible for over half the
economic growth in this country over the past century.

• The energy industry invests only about 0.2 percent of its
revenues on energy RD&D, while the average industrial investment in RD&D is closer to 2.6
percent.
•

Federal investments in low-carbon energy R&D should increase five-fold from $5 billion per
year to $25 billion according to many experts.

•

Energy RD&D investment in New York State, currently $50 million per year, must be
increased substantially to pursue a low-carbon future and stimulate a clean energy economy
in New York.

•

New York energy RD&D funds should be targeted toward helping New York businesses
develop low-carbon technologies while also addressing local energy and infrastructure needs,
thereby helping to stimulate a clean energy economy in the state.

•

The State must actively promote innovation and commercialization to bring the fruits of
RD&D investment to the market and to realize local economic benefits, as described further
in Chapter 13 on the Clean Energy Economy.

•

RD&D needs for buildings and industry of relevance to New York include deep-retrofit
strategies for existing buildings, onsite energy storage systems, building-scale renewables,
active power management, consumer behavior modification, whole-building/zero energy
buildings, and non-fossil-fuel based industrial process technologies.

OV-36

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

•

RD&D needs related to transportation and land use include intelligent transportation systems,
alternative fuel vehicles, and related infrastructure—in particular electric vehicle
infrastructure, vehicle efficiency optimization for urban duty cycles, smart growth pilots, and
improvements in electrified rail.

•

RD&D needs in power supply and delivery include marine-based resource development,
including off-shore wind, advanced wind resource forecasting, carbon capture and
sequestration assessments, grid integration of large-scale solar and smart grid.

•

RD&D needs in agriculture, forestry, and waste include carbon sequestration in agriculture
and forest lands, and sustainable biomass resource development.

It is important to note that New York State cannot support the entire technology development
process (basic research, technology development, large-scale demonstration, commercial
adoption) on its own. The Interim Report acknowledges a clear role must be established for the
federal government and the private sector that efficiently optimizes limited resources,
appropriately assigns technical and business risk, and ensures a consistent and stable flow of
investment capital to finance advanced energy technologies. Any State-level investment strategy
must function as an advocacy tool to drive national RD&D energy policy and leverage privatesector RD&D investments.

9.0 Adapting New York to Climate Change
To create a more climate-resilient New York
State, the Climate Action Plan places a strong
emphasis on adaptation. Climate change already
is affecting New York’s society, economy, and
natural ecosystems, and these impacts are
expected to increase. Past climate is no longer a
reliable guide to the future. New climate
conditions and unpredictability in the climate
affect all of New York’s social and economic
systems, particularly agriculture, infrastructure,
public health, and natural resources.
In this historic photo, storm surge is poised to wash over
Battery Park in New York City. Rising sea levels will bring
more dangerous storm surges, not only for communities at
sea level, but also for upland communities near tidal rivers,
such as the Hudson.

Adaptation: Planning for a Changing
Climate in New York State

Adaptation can be thought of simply as
responsible planning, incorporating the most
current information about projected climate change into a variety of decisions. Adaptation
strategies can include changes in policies, operations, management, or infrastructure that reduce
risk of harm and/or take advantage of potential opportunities associated with climate change.
Adaptation can take place at the individual, household, community, organizational, and
institutional levels. New York State as a whole is generally considered to have significant
resources and capacity for effective adaptation, but the costs and benefits of adaptation will not
be evenly distributed throughout the State.

OV-37

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

Climate Risks and Adaptation Planning
Incorporating adaptation into decision making requires the following:
•

Understanding how the climate in New York State might
change

•

Identifying potential vulnerabilities to a changing climate—
infrastructure or resources that could be harmed if the climate
changes

•

Assessing the risk levels of those vulnerabilities

•

Developing adaptation strategies that will help to minimize
those risks

•

Prioritizing adaptation strategies and developing an adaptation
plan that coordinates with GHG mitigation strategies and
economic development.

Past climate
conditions alone
are no longer a
reliable guide when
planning for
the future.

Prerequisites to Successful Adaptation Planning
The Adaptation Technical Work Group identified seven themes that emerged for all sectors as
important first steps to implementation of adaptation policy options. These themes are
summarized below:
•

Develop a process to maintain, disseminate and explain to decision makers a set of bestavailable climate projections, potentially via a New York State Climate Science Institute.

•

Identify and track key climate change indicators important to New York.

•

Develop a framework to monitor, assess, and share progress on local, state, and federal
government adaptation planning and implementation.

•

Initiate research to develop new adaptation strategies and provide detail and confidence to
support adaptation strategy decisions.

•

Evaluate emergency preparedness, management and response capabilities (such as
emergency warning systems, cooling centers, emergency evacuation, and preparation for
power and/or communication outages) in light of climate projections, to determine where
these capabilities will be compromised by climate threats in New York.

•

Initiate widespread education and outreach, including both school curricula and community
outreach, to build public support and awareness.

•

Develop adaptation policies that protect those citizens and communities most vulnerable to
the impacts from climate change.

The following sections outline the adaptation vulnerabilities and policy options developed by the
Adaptation Technical Work Group for eight sectors of New York’s economy and natural
resources.

OV-38

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

9.1 Agriculture Sector Adaptation
Agriculture Climate Vulnerabilities
Farmers are on the front lines of climate change, but the direct impacts on crops, livestock, and
pests and the costs of farm adaptation will cascade throughout New York’s economy. While
climate change will create unprecedented challenges, there are likely to be new opportunities as
well, such as possible new markets for food and energy crops suited to a longer growing season
and warmer temperatures.
New York’s agriculture sector encompasses more
than 34,000 farms that occupy about one-quarter of
the state's land area (more than 7.5 million acres)
and contribute $4.5 billion annually to its
economy. Many New York crops benefit from the
state’s historically relatively temperate climate.
The state’s farming community includes many
large-scale wholesale operations, as well as small
farms that are vital to the economy of rural areas.

Dairy farming, New York’s top agricultural activity, is
vulnerable to climate change because milk yields
decrease in warmer temperatures.

greater temperature variability and extremes.
A. Continue research, development, and deployment of livestock protection measures and
climate-related modifications to feed management systems and approaches.
B. Increase installation of energy-efficient cooling systems and other structural or mechanical
interventions.

9.2 Coastal Zones Adaptation
Coastal Zones Climate Vulnerabilities in New York
New York’s coastal zone includes the shoreline, coastal wetland areas, and adjacent inland areas
likely to be affected by sea level rise and coastal
storms. Even in a densely populated urban
environment such as New York City, coastal
ecosystems provide numerous functions and values.

Adapting to climate change is urgent for coastal cities
and communities. New York City already is planning
for rising sea levels. Communities on the Hudson River
also recognize that they are vulnerable to storm surges
that propagate up the river.

Sea level rise will greatly amplify risks of
permanent inundation of low-lying coastal areas,
more frequent flooding by storm surges, and
increased beach erosion. Saltwater could reach
farther up the Hudson River, contaminating urban
water supplies; increased water depth could allow
faster propagation of tide and storm surges up the
Hudson, increasing flood risk far from the coast.

Sea level rise will progressively affect both human
and natural systems as it changes water levels on the ocean and estuarine coastline, shortens
flood-recurrence intervals, and increases risk and geographic extent of coastal hazards such as
storm-surge-related flooding, erosion, and groundwater intrusion.
Figure OV-18. Coastal Zones Adaptation Policy Options with Brief Descriptions
Coastal Zones Adaptation Policy Options
1: New York State should endorse a coordinated set of projections for sea level rise and
associated changes in flood recurrence intervals in all coastal areas, including the Hudson
River estuary, for use by state and local agencies and authorities for planning and decisionmaking purposes.
2: Integrate sea level rise and flood recurrence interval projections into all relevant agency
programs and decisions.

protective features to reduce impacts from coastal hazards.
A. Develop Coastal Resilience Plans
B. Assist in funding measures to reduce risk
5: Develop a long-term interagency mechanism to regularly evaluate climate change science;
set research priorities to foster adaptation; coordinate actions; and assess progress

9.3 Ecosystems Adaptation
Ecosystems Climate Vulnerabilities in New York
New York State includes 47,047 square miles of land, 1,894 square miles of inland lakes and
rivers, and 3,988 square miles of Great Lakes. Variation in topography and proximity to water
bodies causes large climatic variations, and distinct ecological zones support biological diversity
and provide important ecosystem services, including harvested products (food, timber, biomass,
and maple syrup), clean water, flood control, soil conservation, carbon sequestration, genetic
resources, recreation, wild places, and heritage sites.
Initial impacts of climate change on species are already
apparent, with documented accounts of species range shifts
and changes in the seasonal timing of bud-break or
flowering. Climate change creates risks to biodiversity, net
primary productivity, vegetation water use, and
biogeochemical cycles, but to date, there is not unequivocal
evidence of impacts on ecosystem services such as carbon
sequestration or water storage and quality in New York
State.
Within the next several decades New York State is likely New York's brook trout population, already at
risk from increasing temperatures, is likely to

be severely reduced by continued warming.
Warmer temperatures will favor the expansion of some
invasive species into New York, some habitat and food generalists (such as white-tailed deer)
may benefit. Climate factors could increase the productivity of some hardwood tree species,
provided growth is not limited by other factors such as drought or nutrient deficiency.

abundant populations of fish, wildlife, plants, and human communities that are adapted to
survive in a changing climate.
A. Support State agency efforts to incorporate an Ecosystem Based Management approach that
factors ecosystem function, services, and biodiversity into decision making, including
management plans, funding decisions, and policies.
B. To enable ecosystems to better respond to changing climate conditions, incorporate adaptive
management principles, techniques, and approaches into New York’s forest management
policies and programs.
C. Protect and enhance the stability and function of stream, river, and aquatic coastal systems to
accommodate changing climate conditions.
3: Develop a research and monitoring plan to detect, record, and analyze changes in species,
habitat composition, natural cycles, and fish and wildlife health, and effectively address current
and future threats in changing climate conditions.
4: Expand climate change education and outreach initiatives on the potential impacts of climate
change to natural areas and ecosystem services.

9.4 Energy Adaptation
Energy Vulnerabilities in New York
Reliable energy systems are critical to commerce and quality of life. New York State’s electricity
and gas supply and distribution systems are highly reliable, but extreme weather events,
temperature, and flooding can damage equipment, disrupt fuel supply chains, reduce power plant
output levels or increase demand beyond the energy system’s operational capacity. Downstate
coastal energy infrastructure is vulnerable to flooding by sea level rise and storm surges.
Renewable generation can be affected by drought, changes in precipitation patterns, cloud cover,
or other factors characteristic of climate change.

meeting peak demand.
A. Incorporate best available projections of changes in seasonal average temperatures and
increased frequency of extreme heat events in near and longer-term demand forecasting for
electricity and natural gas.
B. Plan for meeting regional demand growth and improved system resiliency through local
implementation of demand response and energy efficiency measures, greater use of localized
distributed generation, energy storage, other energy supply technologies, and smart-grid
technologies, beyond those efforts already underway and planned.
2: Increase utilities’ and energy providers’ resiliency to climate-related impacts.
A. Ensure that best available projections concerning the frequency and severity of extreme storm
events are incorporated into State and regional emergency response plans.
B. Ensure that detailed statewide maps are available to assist in identifying areas and
infrastructure at high risk from storm and flood damage.
C. Work with organizations such as the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and NYSEARCH
(a voluntary sub-organization within the Northeast Gas Association) to survey and assess utility
industry best practices for increasing resilience to climate change.

9.5 Public Health Adaptation
Public Health Vulnerabilities in New York
Some current health conditions are considered sensitive to the changing climate. Cardiovascular
disease, the leading cause of death in the state, is made worse by extreme heat and poor air
quality. Childhood asthma, an important health challenge in many parts of New York State,
especially New York City, is made worse by poor air quality. Several vector-borne diseases
(those spread by carriers such as mosquitoes and ticks) have emerged in the past few decades.
A diverse state with populations spread unevenly over urban and rural service areas, New York
relies primarily on a county-based system for public health service delivery. This highly
decentralized system leads to non-uniform provision of core services, making public health
adaptation measures more difficult to coordinate.

adaptation programs.

9.6 Transportation Adaptation
Transportation Vulnerabilities in New York
Climate change has significant consequences for the transportation sector. Over the next few
decades, heat waves, heavy precipitation events, and windstorms will likely be the dominant
causes for moderate, frequent transportation
problems such as flooded streets and mass transit
delays. By 2050 at the latest, sea level rise and
storm surge will become more significant threats.
By the latter half of this century, these threats will
be so severe that major adaptations will have to be
in place, not only in the coastal zone, but all the
way to cities in the way of sea level rise and storm
surges propagating up the tide-controlled Hudson
River. Low-lying transportation systems like
subways and tunnels, especially in coastal and
near-coastal areas, are at particular risk of

near New York’s many rivers and streams.
Materials used in transportation infrastructure, such as asphalt and train rails, are vulnerable to
increased temperatures and extreme heat events. Air conditioning requirements in buses, trucks,
and trains and ventilation requirements for tunnels will increase. Some aircraft runways may
require lengthening, since hotter air provides less lift, necessitating higher takeoff speeds.

9.7 Telecommunications/Information Infrastructure Adaptation
Telecommunications/Information Vulnerabilities in New York
Telecommunications infrastructure is vital to New York State's economy and welfare; its
capacity and reliability are essential to the effective functioning of global commerce and the
state's economy and is especially vital during emergencies.
Communication service delivery is vulnerable to hurricanes, lightning, ice, snow, wind storms,
and other extreme weather events, some of which are projected to change in frequency and/or
intensity. Communication lines and other infrastructure are vulnerable to the observed and
projected increase in heavy precipitation events and resulting flooding and/or freezing rain. In
coastal and near-coastal areas, sea level rise in combination with coastal storm surge flooding
will be a considerable threat later this century. The delivery of communication services is

OV-46

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

sensitive to power outages, such as those resulting from the increased demand associated with
heat waves, which are expected to increase with climate change.

C. Develop models, guidance and standards, and financial support where possible to help local
governments implement adaptive measures for priority communication infrastructure.
3: Where feasible and cost effective, reduce vulnerability of telecommunications infrastructure
to extreme weather events.
A. Foster a shift toward a more distributed network of communication infrastructure, including
expansion of wireless services.
B. Planning for investments in communications infrastructure or operational changes planning

the energy sector (e.g., smart grid).
C. Ensure system redundancies for communications infrastructure at high risk of flooding and high
winds, including communication towers.
4: Improve the dialogue on climate resiliency between State agencies and private
telecommunications service providers and provide increased accountability for service
disruptions.
A. To provide increased accountability carriers and other communication service providers should
be required to report compliance with the Federal Communications Commission’s standards.

9.0 Water Resources Adaptation
Water Resources Vulnerabilities in New York
The state’s water and wastewater treatment infrastructure is in dire need of repair and upgrade,
requiring some $36 billion for water treatment and $40 billion for wastewater treatment
improvements. Challenges associated with a changing climate will only exacerbate these needs.
New York is experiencing growing demand for water, both for human consumption and for
energy production. As other parts of the country experience more frequent and intense drought,

OV-47

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

New York’s water resources may become a defining economic asset, drawing people and
businesses into the state and presenting new water resource management challenges.

3: Adopt statewide and region-wide comprehensive sustainable water resources management
strategies that consider climate change.
A. All water-related permit programs and policies should minimize alterations and disruptions to
the natural hydrologic cycle to the extent possible.
B. Create mechanisms to foster development and state approval of regional intermunicipal
watershed management plans that address expected climate change impacts.
4: Allow “room for rivers.” Acknowledge the dynamic nature of rivers on the landscape and
strive to reduce risk to critical infrastructure and human development as the risk of flooding
increases with climate change.
A. Coordinate with key federal and local stakeholders such as the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Department of Agriculture, and county soil and water
conservation districts to identify and map areas of greatest current risk from riverine flooding
and erosion due to movement of rivers across the landscape.
B. Work with federal agencies to reduce new development in areas at high risk of riverine flooding
and undertake long-term managed relocation or elevation of existing structures in these areas.
Restructure disaster recovery policies to ensure that redevelopment efforts strive to reduce
long-term risk.
5: Incorporate water-related climate projections into state and local emergency management
planning.

10.0 Identification of Cross-Sector Policies & Issues
Many issues associated with mitigating and adapting to climate change relate to more than one of
the sectors examined in this planning process. To date, the climate planning process has
identified several important cross-sector issues:
•

Environmental justice and community-based concerns;

•

Near- and long-term workforce training for a clean energy economy;

•

Education, outreach, and behavior change;

•

The transition to increased use of electric vehicles.

OV-48

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

The second phase of climate action planning will seek to identify additional policy interactions
among the final recommendations.
Environmental Justice and Community-Based Concerns
The Climate Action Council made a determined effort throughout the planning process to
integrate input from community-based groups, regional/community focused organizations, and
environmental justice (EJ) groups. These groups served as members of Technical Work Groups
and of the Integration Advisory Panel; in addition, the council held statewide videoconferences
and a series of teleconferences and surveyed community and EJ organizations on proposed
policy options. Details of this discussion and the inputs that resulted are available in Chapter 12
of this Interim Report.
Effective Community Engagement and Public Participation
One of the key ingredients in communities across the world that have successfully engaged on
climate change-related issues is the presence of strong and sustained local leadership. Local
dialogues educate community members, build support for climate policies and facilitate the shift
to a low-carbon economy. Acknowledging and addressing past concerns of the EJ community
with official decisions and planning processes were identified as critical to developing and
implementing the Climate Action Plan.
The plan’s statewide awareness-raising is designed to include tools and guidance to help
communities frame climate-related risks within a local context, along with resources and
technical assistance for community capacity building.
Permitting, Siting, and Environmental Impact Assessment
Climate policy approaches should respect hard-won procedural safeguards designed to ensure
adequate access to official decision making in areas such as permitting, the siting of facilities and
infrastructure, and conducting environmental impact assessments. As part of the climate action
planning process, EJ stakeholders emphasized the importance of assessing the cumulative risks
and impacts of different types of stressors, facilities, and infrastructure on the health and quality
of life of communities and adequately analyzing the public health implications of proposed
policies. Transparency and timely access to information were advanced as critical in all the
policy areas.
Waterfront Facilities and Public Health
Waterfront facilities, especially wastewater treatment plants, petroleum/chemical bulk storage
sites, and solid waste management facilities, are particularly vulnerable to climate change
impacts and represent risks to surrounding communities. Particular attention should be given to
the medium- and long-term contamination and public health consequences associated with
coastal flooding.
Fair Share of Burdens and Benefits
No single neighborhood or group should be forced to bear a disproportionate share of the
environmental consequences resulting from industrial, commercial, or municipal operations or
from the execution of government programs and policies. Community/EJ stakeholders pointed

OV-49

New York State Climate Action Council
Interim Report 11-9-10

out that a nuanced approach could help to balance the legacy of environmental pollution and
burdens in EJ communities, such as awarding overburdened communities a greater proportion of
beneficial climate projects and policy initiatives.
Near- and Long-Term Workforce Training for a Clean Energy Economy
The Residential, Commercial/Institutional, and Industrial (RCI) Technical Work Group
identified near-term workforce training and development as a priority policy option (RCI-6).
However, because workforce issues cut across all sectors, near-term training needs for all
mitigation sectors are incorporated into the Workforce Training and Development Policy (RCI6) (see Chapter 6). As we implement new clean energy technologies and practices and make
permanent changes in the way we use resources, we need a trained workforce for projects in
energy efficiency; site-based clean and renewable energy resources; power supply and demand;
smart grid technologies; codes and standards; agriculture, forestry, and waste; transportation; and
manufacturing and other related areas. Chapter 6 of this Interim Report summarizes the
workforce policy discussion and details opportunities to expand upon current workforce training,
continuing education, credentialing, licensing, on-the-job training, and recruitment and job
placement.
Long-term workforce training is addressed in the Building Block #2 section of Chapter 13:
Stimulating a Clean Energy Economy in New York. Over the long term, training must enable
New York to identify and respond to workforce development needs as they arise and to prepare
future generations of workers for the low-carbon economy.
The innovation-based model that will underlie New York’s low-carbon economy requires a full
spectrum of educational support. From the K-12 system, grounding is needed in math, science,
environmental sustainability and alternatives to a carbon-based economy, and preparation for
entrepreneurship. From higher education, new curricula, certifications and degrees for lowcarbon technologies, and access for current workers to skills upgrades as technologies evolve are
critical.
Education, Outreach, and Behavior Change
Government must lead by example and take responsibility for developing an implementation
strategy that meets the 80 by 50 goal and guides the transition to a low-carbon economy in a
cost-effective and politically and socially acceptable manner.
The first step for State agencies and local governments is internal outreach and education
promoting the Climate Action Plan and making climate change considerations part of routine
government activities and decisions. At the same time, robust, well-funded, and effective
external outreach, education, and awareness raising should acquaint all citizens with the
substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits the Climate Action Plan will generate.
Transition to Electric Vehicles
At present, the transportation sector produces nearly 40 percent of New York’s combustionbased GHG emissions, the vast majority from gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicles. Plug-in
electric vehicles (EV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), and fuel cell vehicles powered
by hydrogen derived from electrolysis could displace a significant portion of this petroleum

consumption by using electricity for all or portions of vehicle trips. If this electricity had a low or
near-zero-carbon intensity, the carbon footprint from this segment could be nearly eliminated.
A cross-sectoral vehicle subgroup worked on a comprehensive, multisectoral strategy to achieve
EV penetration as part of the Climate Action Plan, integrating issues applying to power supply
generation, transmission and distribution, vehicles, and vehicle charging infrastructure. The
following items were among its findings:
• PHEVs, EVs, and fuel cell vehicles
having acceptable performance for many
applications are a reality, and vehicles
deriving their fuel from the electric grid are
likely to become a cost-effective means of
achieving carbon-free mobility.

Fuel mileage of 125 mpg is the promise of this plug-in hybrid,
newly introduced as a way to reduce GHG emissions and
petroleum consumption. This year, several auto
manufacturers are commercially introducing electric vehicles.

• Through the mid-term (2025) New
York’s transmission grid has adequate
capacity to accommodate the maximum
(30 percent) anticipated penetration of EV
and PHEVs with smart charging. Minor
upgrades in the distribution system could be
needed on a very localized basis.

• Policy and regulations should encourage
the development of a variety of business
models for charging/re-fueling, and policies should encourage off-peak charging to maximize
benefits. In the near term, incentives will likely be necessary to induce EV adoption.

The full report of the Electric Vehicle Subgroup is found in Appendix G of this Interim Report.

11.0 National and Regional Action and Coordination
To successfully reduce the impacts a changing climate will have on New York’s people,
environment, and economy will require coordinated policy and action by all levels of
government—federal, state, and local. Given the global nature of the climate change challenge,
U.S. federal government action will be essential to successfully position the American economy
in an evolving international marketplace and to enable the United States to lead efforts to achieve
a global solution. Federal action will create a fertile arena for development of the new
technologies that will be needed to achieve the scale of emission reductions needed, and it will
enable New York businesses to compete on a level playing field with businesses in other states
and nations.
New York’s domestic energy, environment, and economic development interests can be
successfully augmented through participation in regional efforts that achieve more change, in a
more equitable manner, than New York acting alone. National and regional programs can result
in greater reductions at a lower marginal cost than programs implemented by a single state, and
State actions also are most effective when coordinated with local government activities.

Finally, climate change is, at its core, a global issue that will require the dedicated action and
attention by all governments, industries, and citizens. New York already is working and should
continue to work with other states, subnational entities, and other nations to achieve an
international solution to climate change.
This chapter makes the following specific recommendations and observations:
•

New York should seek implementation of national or regional market mechanisms to price
carbon and reduce emissions. A national program can be implemented through Congressional
action or a collaborative effort between states and EPA under the Clean Air Act.

•

Leveraging the opportunities available under federal programs such as production and
investment tax credits and a national renewable electricity standard can help create a robust
market demand for clean energy.

•

National electricity transmission policy should facilitate achievement of New York’s climate
goals rather than providing an avenue for importing coal-fired power.

•

New York should take advantage of the federal government’s advanced energy technology
investment policy. Developing new clean energy technologies requires a substantial and
sustained commitment from the federal government.

•

Federal investment in, and support for, nuclear technology and carbon capture and
sequestration will help New York achieve its climate protection goals, while preserving
system reliability. Given the financial commitment needed to advance the technology in
these areas, the federal government is best positioned to make the necessary investments.

•

Regional and national transportation initiatives will be essential to achieving New York’s
climate goals, including strong national vehicle emission and fuel economy standards and
regional low-carbon fuel standards, regional transportation pricing strategies, and regional
rail initiatives.

•

New York should advocate for strict national standards for appliances and other products
that are sources of greenhouse gas emissions.

•

Federal agencies should cooperate to create and
implement regulatory frameworks that foster energy
efficiency and distributed renewable energy. For
example, the federal government should facilitate
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing.

•

National education policy to foster innovation and
technology is important to achieving New York’s
climate protection goals.

•

The federal government should target infrastructure investments that advance climate change
objectives, such as high-speed rail and a more intelligent electricity grid.

•

Federal and state policy should engage localities and communities as active participants in
achieving climate goals.

•

New York should support efforts to achieve an international solution to climate change. New
York can play a critical role in providing an example of the policies that can be implemented
worldwide to mitigate climate change.

Achieving a comprehensive solution to global climate change requires New York to collaborate
with regional partners and the federal government on emission reduction strategies, and to seek
action across the community of nations. Although comprehensive federal legislation is
preferable, until such legislation is in place, the federal government should seek to target its
broad suite of policies and programs toward promoting low-carbon technology and behavior.

12.0 Next Steps
With this Interim Report, the Climate Action Council is seeking stakeholder and public response
to the initial climate action planning work, including input on the mitigation and adaptation
policy options. During 2011, work will continue to complete the required analyses of the policy
options, which will inform a final Climate Action Plan.
New York State will then need to develop more specific near-term implementation strategies to
effectuate policy and practice. The State will need to establish clear targets and evaluate progress
toward those targets. A mechanism to update this long-term plan on a regular basis will be
needed, as the technology, the state-of-science, and the broader public policy environment will
continue to change.
Further, given the strong linkages between GHG emissions and energy policy, strategies to
reduce GHG emissions will also need to be considered further in the development of New
York’s State Energy Plan as well as in other planning processes, such as state implementation
plans for various co-pollutants.
The recently enacted Article 6 of the Energy Law requires the State Energy Plan to include an
inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, and strategies for facilitating and accelerating the use of
low-carbon energy sources and carbon mitigation measures. Thus, the State Energy Plan will
become a mechanism to deliberate and advance appropriate energy policy that fully accounts for
the climate change impacts from New York energy production and use.
