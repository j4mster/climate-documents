October 30, 2008
Dear Governor Beebe,
It is our honor to transmit to you the final report of the Governor’s Commission on
Global Warming, representing the fulfillment of Act 696 (HB 2460), signed into law by
you and approved by the 86th General Assembly.
You will see in this report that -- for the past year -- the members of the Governors
Commission on Global Warming (GCGW) have worked hard to answer your charge to
“place Arkansas in a position to help stabilize global climate, to allow Arkansas to lead
the nation in attracting clean and renewable energy industries to the state, and to reduce
consumer energy dependence on current carbon-generating technologies and
expenditures.”
Based on this work, the Commission recommends that Arkansas adopt a statewide global
warming pollutant goal to reduce the state’s gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
below 2000 levels accordingly: 20% by 2020; 35% by 2025; and 50% by 2035.
Specifically, to meet these goals, the Commission recommends adoption of a
comprehensive set of 54 policies to address climate, energy, and commerce related issues
in Arkansas.
To reach agreement on these 54 policies, the Commission identified, designed and
analyzed a full suite of Arkansas specific actions, including assessment of GHG
reduction potential, cost and cost savings, potential co-benefits, and consideration of
numerous feasibility issues. The Commission also developed and approved the first
comprehensive, statewide GHG inventory and forecast developed for Arkansas, covering
the years 1990 through 2025.
Furthermore, during these proceedings, the Commission reviewed the physical science of
climate change as well as recent developments in U.S. law. This review included the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report, and that Panel’s
study and assessment of impacts on the southern United States, as well as a review of the
current status of international, federal and state law and policy on climate change and the
treatment of science under the law.
Finally, we want to specifically offer our thanks and gratitude to the 21 appointed
members of your Commission, the Members of the Beebe Administration serving on the
Advisory Group, legislative staff, members of the public, and especially the Center for
Climate Strategies for their independent facilitation, technical assistance, and expertise.
Their public service to our state will leave a lasting legacy.
This initiative marks an exciting beginning for Arkansas. As we establish our own course
for state, regional and national leadership on global climate change, this report provides a
roadmap for substantial new opportunities for our economy, our energy needs, and our
environment.

We look forward to working with you, your Administration, Members of the General
Assembly, the private sector, and many others as we seek to implement the work of this
Commission. We also seek a complete follow-through on this report through further
tracking, review, and public collaboration, to ensure that both current and future
generations of Arkansans fully benefit from its recommendations.
On behalf of the Commission, we want to thank you for the opportunity to serve on
behalf of this critical and historic effort for our state.
Sincerely,

Hon. Kathy Webb

Kevin Smith

Executive Summary
Background
With the signing of Act 696 of the Arkansas 86th General Assembly (HB2460), 1 Governor Mike
Beebe established the Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW). By design the
Commission represents a wide diversity of views and perspectives with members coming from
business, industry, environmental groups, and academia. Seventeen of the 21 members of the
Commission were appointed by the Governor and two members each were appointed by the
President Pro Tempore of the Arkansas State Senate and by the Speaker of the Arkansas House
of Representatives.
As stated by Act 696, the purpose of the GCGW process is “to place Arkansas in a position to
help stabilize global climate, to allow Arkansas to lead the nation in attracting clean and
renewable energy industries to the state, and to reduce consumer energy dependence on current
carbon-generating technologies and expenditures.” The primary duties outlined in Act 696 task
the GCGW to:
1. “Conduct an in-depth examination and evaluation of the issues related to global warming
and the potential impacts of global warming on the state, its citizens, its natural resources,
and its economy, including without limitation, agriculture, travel and tourism, recreation,
insurance, and economic growth and development.”
2. “Based on the commission’s evaluation of the current global warming data, the
assessment of global warming mitigation strategies, and the available global warming
pollutant reduction strategies, the commission shall set forth
a. A global warming pollutant reduction goal; and
b. A comprehensive strategic plan for implementation of the global warming
pollutant reduction goal.”
Act 696 includes an Emergency Clause, as follows: “It is found and determined by the General
Assembly of the State of Arkansas that it is imperative that Arkansas study the scientific data,
literature, and research on global warming to determine whether global warming is an immediate
threat to the citizens in the State of Arkansas; that the potential impact of global warming on the
state and its citizens, its natural resources, and the economy necessitates a thorough review by
the state and a strategy to deal with the consequences of global warming; that economic
opportunities might arise from an emerging carbon market tailored to reduce carbon emissions;
that failure to take necessary steps to prevent, stabilize, or mitigate the effects of global warming
will cause irreparable harm to the lives and livelihoods of Arkansans; and that this act is
immediately necessary to ensure the welfare and well-being of the citizens of this state.
Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being immediately necessary for the
preservation of the public peace, health, and safety…”

In fulfillment of the requirements of Act 696, the GCGW provides the following key
recommendations and accomplishments:
!

Recommendation of a comprehensive set of 54 specific policies to reduce GHG emissions
and address climate-, energy-, and commerce-related issues in Arkansas. The GCGW
members present and voting approved 28 policy actions unanimously, approved 23 by a
super majority (five objections or fewer, including 19 that had only one objection), and
approved 3 by a majority (fewer than half object). Explanations of objections are in
Appendices F through J of this report, which contain detailed accounts of the GCGW’s
recommendations.

!

Recommendation that Arkansas adopt a statewide, economy-wide global warming pollutant
reduction goal to reduce the state’s gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 2000
levels by 20% by 2020, 35% by 2025, and 50% by 2035. 2 The GCGW based its
recommendations on its review of the potential overall emission reduction estimates (as
compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast) for 31 of 54 policy
recommendations for which emission reductions were quantified, and its review of goals and
targets adopted by several other states. Of the 54 policy recommendations, 31 were analyzed
quantitatively to have a cumulative effect of reducing emissions by about 35.5 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2020 and 53.3 MMtCO2e in 2025.
Together, if the 31 quantified policy recommendations and the recent federal actions (or their
functional equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2020 emission reduction goal would
be achieved and the 2025 GHG emission reduction goal would come very close to being
achieved based on results of analysis of GCGW proposals conducted through the GCGW and
Technical Work Group (TWG) process. In addition, the GCGW recommends that the state
report to the Governor and the state legislature every 2 years on the state’s progress toward
achieving the statewide GHG reduction goal and identify future actions and resource needs.

!

Evaluation of the direct costs and direct cost savings of the policy recommendations in
Arkansas. The GCGW analyzed quantitatively the direct costs or cost savings of 29 of its 54
policy recommendations. Although the total net cost associated with the 29 policies analyzed
is estimated at about $3.7 billion between 2009 and 2025, the weighted-average costeffectiveness of the 29 policies is estimated to be approximately $8.8/tCO2e reduced. Many
of the policies are estimated to yield significant cost-saving opportunities for Arkansans.
Other policies will incur net costs.

!

Review, update, and approval of a comprehensive inventory and forecast of GHG emissions
in Arkansas for 1990 through 2025. This is the first comprehensive, statewide GHG
inventory and forecast that has been developed for Arkansas. It has benefited from the
expertise of many GCGW, TWG, and Advisory Body members who provided state-specific
data.

!

A review of the physical science of climate change and potential implications for the
southern United States and developments in U.S. law related to climate change issues. The
GCGW held a special evening session at which a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change presented the results of that panel’s study and of the assessments of impacts

Year 2000 was selected as the base year for the goals because emissions inventory data are more complete for year
2000 than for previous years.

of international, federal and state law on the subject and the treatment of science under the
law.

Inventory of Arkansas’ Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In May 2008, the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) completed a draft GHG emissions
inventory and reference case projection to assist the GCGW and TWGs in understanding past,
current, and possible future GHG emissions in Arkansas, and thereby inform the policy
development process.3 The preliminary draft was improved by incorporating comments provided
by the GCGW and TWGs. As shown in Figure EX-1, the inventory and projections revealed
substantial emission growth rates and related mitigation challenges.
Arkansas’ GHG emissions are rising faster than those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to
2005, Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions increased by 30%, while national gross emissions rose by
16%. 4 The state’s emissions on a per-capita basis increased by about 10% between 1990 and
2005, while U.S. per-capita emissions declined slightly (2%) over this period. On a per-capita
basis, Arkansans emitted about 31 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 2005—higher than the
national average of about 24 tCO2e. The higher per capita emission rates in Arkansas are driven
by emissions growth in the electricity supply, transportation, and agricultural sectors
(agricultural sector emissions are twice the national average). In both Arkansas and the nation as
a whole, economic growth exceeded emissions growth throughout the 1990–2005 period. From
1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 26% nationally, and by 23% in
Arkansas. 5 Arkansans’ gross GHG emissions are projected to rise fairly steeply to about 114
MMtCO2e by 2025, or 74% over 1990 levels.
The principal sources of Arkansas’ GHG emissions in 2005 are electricity consumption and
transportation, accounting for 32% and 26% of Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions, respectively, as
shown in Figure EX-2. The direct use of fuels—natural gas, oil products, coal, and wood—in the
residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors accounted for another 18% of the state’s
emissions in 2005.

Figure EX-2 shows the agricultural and forest wildfire (including prescribed burning) sectors
together accounted for 14% of the gross GHG emissions in Arkansas in 2005. These methane
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions primarily come from agricultural soils, rice cultivation,
enteric fermentation, and manure management. Industrial process emissions accounted for
another 5% of the state’s GHG emissions in 2005, and are rising due to the increasing use of
hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons as substitutes for ozone-depleting

EX-4

chlorofluorocarbons. 6 Other industrial process emissions include CO2 released by cement and
lime manufacturing; CO2 released during soda ash, limestone, and dolomite use; CO2 released
during ammonia, urea, and iron and steel production; N2O released during nitric acid production;
and sulfur hexafluoride released from transformers used in electricity transmission and
distribution systems. Also, landfills and wastewater management facilities produce CH4 and N2O
emissions that accounted for 3% of total gross GHG emissions in Arkansas in 2005. Similarly,
emissions associated with the production, processing, transmission, and distribution of fossil
fuels accounted for 3% of the gross GHG emissions in 2005.
Forestry emissions refer to the net CO2 flux 7 from forested lands in Arkansas, which account for
about 56% of the state’s land area. 8 Arkansas’ forests are estimated to be net sinks of CO2
emissions in the state, reducing net GHG emissions by 19 MMtCO2e in 2005. In addition,
estimates of net carbon fluxes from agricultural soil cultivation practices are estimated to be net
sinks of CO2 emissions in Arkansas.

Recent Actions
Just prior to the beginning of the GCGW process, the federal Energy Independence and Security
Act of 2007 (EISA) was signed into law in December 2007. This law contains several
requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they are implemented over the next few years.
Sufficient information was identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission
reductions associated with implementing certain provisions of this law pertaining to increasing
corporate average fuel economy for the national on-road vehicle fleet, and energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting. The GHG emission reductions projected to be
achieved by these actions when implemented in Arkansas were estimated and included in the
baseline of related GCGW policy recommendations. Together, these federal requirements are
estimated to reduce gross GHG emissions for all sectors combined in Arkansas by about 3.1
MMtCO2e (a 2.9% reduction) from the business-as-usual emissions in 2020, and by about 4.1
MMtCO2e (a 3.6% reduction) from the business-as-usual emissions in 2025. Note, however, that
GHG emission reductions associated with EISA's Title IV (Energy Savings in Buildings and
Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in Government and Public Institutions) requirements have
not been quantified because of the uncertainties in how they will be implemented. It is expected
that these requirements will overlap with some of the RCI policy recommendations, especially
RCI-2b, RCI-3a, RCI-3b, RCI-4a, and RCI-4b.
Arkansas has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to

Chlorofluorocarbons are also potent GHGs; however, they are not included in GHG estimates because of concerns
related to implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Affect the Ozone Layer. See Appendix I in
the Final Inventory and Projections report for Arkansas

Service Commission (APSC) to develop energy efficiency and conservation programs to address
high energy costs. In January 2007, APSC issued its energy efficiency and conservation plan
rules. The electric and gas utilities proposed a series of programs in July 2007, and the APSC
approved several energy efficiency and conservation programs. The total cost of the initial quickstart programs is approximately $18,530,924 for the initial 2-year period ending December 31,
2009. Municipal and cooperative electric utilities are also currently pursuing energy efficiency
programs.

GCGW Policy Recommendations (Beyond Recent Actions)
The GCGW recommended 54 policy actions. The GCGW members present and voting approved
28 policy actions unanimously, approved 23 by a super majority (five objections or fewer), and
approved 3 by a majority (fewer than half object). Explanations of objections are in Appendices
F through J to this report, which contain detailed accounts of the GCGW’s recommendations.
A total of 31 of the 54 policy recommendations were analyzed quantitatively to estimate their
effects on emissions. Of these 31 analyzed for their emission reductions, 29 were analyzed
quantitatively to estimate their costs or cost savings. The 31 recommendations for which emission
reductions were quantified were estimated to have a cumulative effect of reducing emissions by
about 17.6 MMtCO2e in 2015, 35.5 MMtCO2e in 2020, and 53.3 MMtCO2e in 2025.
Figure EX-3 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the recent federal actions and the 31 policy recommendations relative to the
business-as-usual reference case projections. Table EX-1 provides the numeric estimates
underlying Figure EX-3. In Figure EX-3:
!

The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
2020, and 2025) levels of Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis. (The
consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Arkansas to meet the state’s demand for electricity)

!

The red line shows projected emissions associated with recent federal actions that were
analyzed quantitatively.

!

The green line shows projected emissions if all of the GCGW’s 31 recommendations that
were analyzed quantitatively with respect to their GHG reduction potential are implemented
successfully and the estimated reductions are fully achieved. (Note that other GCGW
recommendations would have the effect of reducing emissions, but those reductions were not
analyzed quantitatively, so are not reflected in the green line.)

!

The black line shows the projected emission level associated with the GCGW’s
recommendation for Arkansas to adopt a statewide, economy-wide global warming pollutant
reduction goal to reduce the state’s gross GHG emissions below 2000 levels by 20% by
2020, 35% by 2025, and 50% by 2035. Together, if the 31 quantified policy
recommendations and the recent federal actions (or their equivalent) are successfully
implemented, the 2020 emission reduction goal would be achieved and the 2025 GHG
emission reduction goal would come very close to being achieved based on results of
analysis of GCGW proposals conducted through the GCGW and TWG process.

* Reductions from recent actions include the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Title III. GHG
reductions from Titles IV and V of this Act have not been quantified because of the uncertainties in how they will be
implemented. It is expected that Titles IV and V measures will overlap with RCI policies.
†

Projected annual emissions also include reductions from recent actions.

For the policies recommended by the GCGW to yield the levels of estimated emission reductions
shown in Table EX-2, they must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.

The values in this table do not include the effects of recent actions. Negative values in the Net Present Value and the
Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings associated with the policy recommendations.
Within each sector, values have been adjusted to eliminate double counting for policies or elements of policies that
overlap. In addition, values associated with policies or elements of policies within a sector that overlap with policies or
elements of policies in another sector have been adjusted to eliminate double counting. Appendix G (for the RCI
sectors), Appendix J (for the AFW sectors), and Appendix I (for the TLU sectors) of this report provide documentation
of how sector-level emission reductions and costs (or cost savings) were adjusted to eliminate double counting
associated with overlaps between policies

Figure EX-4 presents the estimated tons of reductions for each policy recommendation for which
estimates were quantified, expressed as a cumulative figure for the period 2009–2025. Figure
EX-5 presents the estimated dollars-per-ton cost (or cost savings, depicted as a negative number)
for each policy recommendation for which cost estimates were quantified. This measure is
calculated by dividing the net present value of the cost of the policy recommendation by the
cumulative GHG reductions, all for the period 2009–2025.
Figure EX-6 presents a stepwise marginal cost curve for Arkansas. The horizontal axis represents
the percentage of GHG emissions reduction in 2025 for each option relative to the business as
usual (BAU) forecast. The vertical axis represents the marginal cost of mitigation (expressed as
the cost-effectiveness of each policy recommendation on a cumulative basis, 2009-2025). In the
figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual policy. The width of the segment
indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the option in percentage terms. The height of
the segment relative to the x-axis shows the average cost (saving) of reducing one MMtCO2e of
GHG emissions with the application of the option.

Summary of Current Scientific Literature on Causes and Impacts of
Global Warming
All panels of scientists who have reviewed the science of climate change have concluded that
there is a 90 to 95% probability that human activities have increased amounts of important
GHGs (primarily CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorocarbons) in the atmosphere to levels not seen in all
of prior human experience, and likely not seen for 3 million years. See, Fourth Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) and in at least three reports of the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS/NRC), Climate Change
Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (2001) (“Climate Change Science”), NAS/NRC,
Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years (2006); NAS/NRC, Abrupt
Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises (2002). These findings are also reflected in the summary
of science prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in the Advance
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air
Act, 73 Fed. Reg. 44354 (July 30, 2008). Scientists have already observed increased temperatures

EX-16

and a variety of related effects and, because GHGs have very long residence times in the
atmosphere, if no action is taken to restrict emissions, impacts are likely to increase dramatically.
There are a variety of impacts that are expected to affect Arkansas. These include increases in
severe weather events and drought, which, in turn, can be expected to adversely affect
agriculture. Floods are expected to increase in frequency with related expansion of floodplains
and flood damage. Sea level rise will inundate some nearby coastal areas, and related salt-water
intrusion, coupled with increased drought stress may impact water supplies. In areas dependent
on snow pack, such as the western United States, water supplies will be more severely affected.
Ecosystems and sensitive species could be disrupted as climatic zones move north. Tropical
diseases and insects will move north. Heat-related deaths will increase, although cold-related
deaths will decrease. Climate change impacts in volatile regions of the world could destabilize
these areas and pose a national security threat. There is also a possibility of sudden and dramatic
climate change that cannot be predicted, but would have far greater and adverse impacts.
Although there are books and articles in the popular press that raise questions about climate
change, none have been scientifically peer reviewed. The body of literature that has undergone
peer review is virtually unanimous in concluding that human activities have affected climate and
that the effects will increase if anthropogenic GHG emissions are not reduced. None of the
skeptics will say to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that emissions of GHGs will not
have adverse impacts. The applicable legal standards require action if adverse impacts can be
reasonably anticipated. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 7408(a)(1) (“air pollution which may reasonably be
anticipated to endanger public health or welfare”), 7411(b)(1)(A) (same), 7521(a)(1) (same),
7547(a)(1)(same), 7571(a)(2)(A)(same); see also United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, art. 3, §3.

Chapter 1
Background and Overview
Creation of the Governor’s Commission on Global Warming
Arkansas Act 696
With the signing of Act 696 of the Arkansas 86th General Assembly (HB2460), 1 Governor Mike
Beebe established the Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW). By design, the
Commission represents a wide diversity of views and perspectives, with members coming from
business, industry, environmental groups, and academia. Seventeen of the 21 members of the
Commission were appointed by the Governor, and two members each were appointed by the
President Pro Tempore of the Arkansas State Senate and by the Speaker of the Arkansas House
of Representatives.
As stated by Act 696, the purpose of the GCGW process is to place Arkansas in a position to
help stabilize global climate, to allow Arkansas to lead the nation in attracting clean and
renewable energy industries to the state, and to reduce consumer energy dependence on current
carbon-generating technologies and expenditures. The primary duties outlined in Act 696 task
the GCGW to:
1. “Conduct an in-depth examination and evaluation of the issues related to global warming
and the potential impacts of global warming on the state, its citizens, its natural resources,
and its economy, including without limitation, agriculture, travel and tourism, recreation,
insurance, and economic growth and development.”
2. “Based on the commission’s evaluation of the current global warming data, the
assessment of global warming mitigation strategies, and the available global warming
pollutant reduction strategies, the commission shall set forth
a. A global warming pollutant reduction goal; and
b. A comprehensive strategic plan for implementation of the global warming
pollutant reduction goal.”
Act 696 includes an Emergency Clause, as follows: “It is found and determined by the General
Assembly of the State of Arkansas that it is imperative that Arkansas study the scientific
data, literature, and research on global warming to determine whether global warming is an
immediate threat to the citizens in the State of Arkansas; that the potential impact of global
warming on the state and its citizens, its natural resources, and the economy necessitates a
thorough review by the state and a strategy to deal with the consequences of global warming;
that economic opportunities might arise from an emerging carbon market tailored to reduce
carbon emissions; that failure to take necessary steps to prevent, stabilize, or mitigate the
effects of global warming will cause irreparable harm to the lives and livelihoods of

Arkansans; and that this act is immediately necessary to ensure the welfare and well-being of
the citizens of this state. Therefore, an emergency is declared to exist and this act being
immediately necessary for the preservation of the public peace, health, and safety…”
GCGW’s Response
In fulfillment of the requirements of Act 696, the GCGW provides the following key
recommendations and accomplishments:
!

Recommendation of a comprehensive set of 54 specific policies to reduce GHG emissions
and address climate-, energy-, and commerce-related issues in Arkansas. The GCGW
members present and voting approved 28 policy actions unanimously, approved 23 by a
super majority (five objections or fewer, including 19 that had only one objection), and
approved 3 by a majority (fewer than half object). Explanations of objections are in
Appendices F through J of this report, which contain detailed accounts of the GCGW’s
recommendations.

!

Recommendation that Arkansas adopt a statewide, economy-wide global warming pollutant
reduction goal to reduce the state’s gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 2000
levels by 20% by 2020, 35% by 2025, and 50% by 2035. 2 The GCGW based its
recommendations on its review of the potential overall emission reduction estimates (as
compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast) for 31 of 54 policy
recommendations for which emission reductions were quantified, and its review of goals and
targets adopted by several other states. Of the 54 policy recommendations, 31 were analyzed
quantitatively to have a cumulative effect of reducing emissions by about 35.5 million metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2020 and 53.3 MMtCO2e in 2025.
Together, if the 31 quantified policy recommendations and the recent federal actions (or their
functional equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2020 emission reduction goal would
be achieved, and the 2025 GHG emission reduction goal would come very close to being
achieved based on results of analysis of GCGW proposals conducted through the GCGW and
Technical Work Group (TWG) process. In addition, the GCGW recommends that the state
report to the Governor and the state legislature every 2 years on the state’s progress toward
achieving the statewide GHG reduction goal, and identify future actions and resource needs.

!

Evaluation of the direct costs and direct cost savings of the policy recommendations in
Arkansas. The GCGW analyzed quantitatively the direct costs or cost savings of 29 of its 54
policy recommendations. Although the total net cost associated with the 29 policies analyzed
is estimated at about $3.7 billion between 2009 and 2025, the weighted-average costeffectiveness of the 29 policies is estimated to be approximately $8.8/tCO2e reduced. Many
of the policies are estimated to yield significant cost-saving opportunities for Arkansans.
Other policies will incur net costs.

!

Review, update, and approval of a comprehensive inventory and forecast of GHG emissions
in Arkansas for 1990 through 2025. This is the first comprehensive, statewide GHG
inventory and forecast that has been developed for Arkansas. It has benefited from the

2

Year 2000 was selected as the base year for the goals because emissions inventory data are more complete for year
2000 than for previous years.

expertise of many GCGW, TWG, and Advisory Body members who provided state-specific
data.
!

A review of the physical science of climate change and potential implications for the
southern United States and developments in U.S. law related to climate change issues. The
GCGW held a special evening session at which a member of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change presented the results of that panel’s study and of the assessments of impacts
on the southeastern United States, and an environmental attorney presented the current status
of international, federal, and state law on the subject and the treatment of science under the
law.

Recent Actions
GHG Reductions Associated With Recent Federal Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) was signed into law in
December 2007. This law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they
are implemented over the next few years. During the GCGW process, sufficient information was
identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with
implementing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements and energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting in Arkansas. The GHG emission reductions
projected to be achieved by these actions are shown in Figure 1-1. Table 1-1 provides the
numeric estimates underlying Figure 1-1. Together, these federal requirements are estimated to
reduce gross GHG emissions for all sectors combined in Arkansas by about 3.1 MMtCO2e (a
2.9% reduction) from the business-as-usual emissions in 2020, and by about 4.1 MMtCO2e (a
3.6% reduction) from the business-as-usual emissions in 2025. Note, however, that GHG
emission reductions associated with the EISA's Title IV (Energy Savings in Buildings and
Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in Government and Public Institutions) requirements have
not been quantified because of the uncertainties in how they will be implemented. It is expected
that these requirements will overlap with some of the residential, commercial, and industrial
(RCI) sector policy recommendations, especially RCI-2b, RCI-3a, RCI-3b, RCI-4a, and RCI-4b.
Recent State Actions
Arkansas has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to
concerns about energy costs. Ark. Code Ann. §§23-3-401 et seq. authorizes the Arkansas Public
Service Commission (APSC) to develop energy efficiency and conservation programs to address
high energy costs. In January 2007, APSC issued its energy efficiency and conservation plan
rules. The electric and gas utilities proposed a series of programs in July 2007, and the APSC
approved several energy efficiency and conservation programs. The total cost of the initial quickstart programs is approximately $18,530,924 for the initial 2-year period ending December 31,
2009. Municipal and cooperative electric utilities are also currently pursuing energy efficiency
programs.

The GCGW Process
The GCGW began its deliberative process at its third meeting on February 7, 2008, and met a
total of nine times, with the final decisional meeting held on September 25, 2008, followed by a
conference call for review of this report. In all, more than 75 meetings and teleconferences of the
GCGW and the five supporting TWGs were held to identify and analyze various potential policy
actions in advance of the GCGW’s September 25, 2008, final decisional meeting.

1-4

The five TWGs considered information and potential recommendations in the following sectors:
!

Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI);

!

Energy Supply (ES);

!

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

!

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW); and

!

Cross-Cutting Issues (CC) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) provided facilitation and technical assistance to the
GCGW and each of the TWGs, based on a detailed proposal approved by the GCGW. The
TWGs consisted of only GCGW members; however, the Commission established and appointed
an Advisory Body composed of the directors of the following state agencies: Agriculture
Department, Department of Environmental Quality, Forestry Commission, Highway and
Transportation Department, Natural Resources Commission, Public Service Commission, State
Game and Fish Commission, Department of Economic Development, Department of Parks and
Tourism, and Oil and Gas Commission. Advisory Body members were assigned to each TWG to
assist in responding to questions and providing technical information as requested by the GCGW
members (see Appendix C for a listing of the TWG and Advisory Body members of each TWG).
Members of the public were invited to observe and provide input at all meetings of the GCGW
and TWGs. The TWGs served as advisers to the GCGW and helped generate initial
recommendations on Arkansas-specific policy options to be added to the catalog of existing
states actions; priority policy recommendations for analysis; draft proposals on the design
characteristics and quantification of the proposed policy recommendations; specifications and
assistance for analysis of draft policy options (including best available data sources, methods and
assumptions); and other key elements of policy option proposals, including related policies and
programs, key uncertainties, co-benefits and costs, feasibility issues, and potential barriers to
consensus. Where members of a TWG did not fully agree on recommendations to the GCGW,
the summary of their efforts was reported to the GCGW as a part of its consideration and actions.
The GCGW then made its decisions after reviewing the TWGs’ proposals, including
modifications as deemed appropriate in their judgment.
The GCGW process employed a model of informed self-determination through a facilitated,
stepwise, fact-based, and consensus-building approach. With oversight by the Arkansas
Governor’s Office, the process was conducted by CCS, an independent, expert facilitation and
technical analysis team. It was based on procedures that CCS has used in a number of other state
climate change planning initiatives since 2000, but was adapted specifically for Arkansas. The
GCGW process sought but did not mandate consensus, and it explicitly documented the level of
GCGW support for policies and key findings through a voting process established in advance,
including barriers to full consensus where they existed on final consideration of proposed
actions.
The 54 policy recommendations (out of more than 300 potential options considered) adopted by
the GCGW and presented in this report were developed through a stepwise approach that
included: (1) expanding a list existing states actions to include additional Arkansas-specific
actions; (2) developing a set of “priority for analysis” options for further development; (3)
fleshing these proposals out for full analysis by development of “straw proposals” for level of
1-5

effort, timing and parties involved in implementation; (4) developing and applying a common
framework of analysis for options, including sector specific guidance and detailed specifications
for options that include data sources, methods and key assumptions; (5) reviewing results of
analysis and modifying proposals as needed to address potential barriers to consensus; (6)
finalizing design and analysis of options to remove barriers to final agreement; and (7)
developing other key elements of policy proposals such as implementation mechanisms, cobenefits, and feasibility considerations. At the final three meetings of the process, policy
recommendations with at least majority support (defined as less than half of those present
objecting) from GCGW members present were adopted by the GCGW and included in this
report. The TWGs’ recommendations to the GCGW were documented and presented to the
GCGW at each GCGW meeting. All of the GCGW and TWG meetings were open to the public,
and all materials for and summaries of the GCGW and TWG meetings were posted on the
GCGW Web site (www.arclimatechange.us). A detailed description of the deliberative process is
included in Appendix B.

Analysis of Policy Recommendations
With CCS providing facilitation and technical analysis, the five TWGs submitted
recommendations for policies for GCGW consideration using a “policy option template”
conveying the following key information:
Policy Description
Policy Design (Goals, Timing, Parties Involved)
Implementation Mechanisms
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Key Uncertainties
Additional Benefits and Costs
Feasibility Issues
Status of Group Approval
Level of Group Support
Barriers to Consensus
In its deliberations, the GCGW reviewed, modified, and reached group agreement on various
policy recommendations. The final versions for each sector, conforming to the policy option
templates, appear in Appendices F through J and constitute the most detailed record of decisions
of the GCGW. Appendix E describes the methods used for quantification of the 31 policy
recommendations that were analyzed quantitatively. The quantitative analysis produced
estimates of the GHG emission reductions and direct net costs (or cost savings) of
implementation of various policies, in terms of both a net present value from 2009 to 2025 and a
dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness). The key methods are summarized below.
Estimates of GHG Reductions: Using the projection of future GHG emissions (see below) as a
starting point, 31 policy recommendations were analyzed by CCS to estimate GHG reductions
attributable to each policy in the individual years of 2015 and 2025 and cumulative reductions
over the period 2009–2025. The estimates were prepared in accordance with guidance by the

1-6

appropriate TWG and the GCGW, which later reviewed the estimates and, in some cases,
directed that they be revised with respect to such elements as goals, data sources, assumptions,
sensitivity analysis, and methodology. Many policies were estimated to affect the quantity or
type of fossil fuel combusted; others affected methane or CO2 sequestered. Among the many
assumptions involved in this task was selection of the appropriate GHG accounting framework—
namely, the choice between taking a “production-based” approach versus a “consumption-based”
approach to various sectors of the economy. 3
Estimates of Costs/Cost Savings: The analyses of 29 policy recommendations included
estimates of the direct cost of those policies, in terms of both net costs or cost savings during
2009–2025 and a dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness). (The other two policy
recommendations that were analyzed with respect to their GHG reductions were such that their
costs or cost savings could not be readily estimated.) Following is a brief summary of the
approach used to estimate the costs or cost savings associated with the policy recommendations:
!

Discounted and annualized costs or cost savings—Standard approaches were taken here. The
net present value of costs or cost savings was calculated by applying a real discount rate of
5%. Dollars-per-ton estimates were derived as an annualized cost per ton, dividing the
present value cost or savings by the cumulative GHG reduction measured in tons. As was the
case with GHG reductions, the period 2009–2025 was analyzed.

!

Cost savings— Total net costs or savings were estimated through comparison of monetized
costs and savings of policy implementation over time, using discounting. These net costs
could be positive or negative; negative costs indicated that the policy saved money or
produced “cost savings.” Many policies were estimated to create net financial cost savings
(typically through fuel savings and electricity savings associated with new policy actions).

!

Direct vs. indirect effects—Estimates of costs and cost savings were based on “direct effects”
(i.e., those borne by the entities implementing the policy).4 Implementing entities could be
individuals, companies, and/or government agencies. In contrast, conventional cost-benefit
analysis takes the “societal perspective” and tallies every conceivable impact on every entity
in society (and quantifies these wherever possible).

3

A production-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services produced within the
state, and a consumption-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services consumed
within the state. In some sectors of the economy, these two approaches may not result in significantly different
numbers. However, the power sector is notable, in that it is responsible for large quantities of GHG emissions, and
states often produce more or less electricity than they consume (with the remainder attributable to power exports or
imports). From 1990 to 1999 and from 2001 to 2004, Arkansas was a net exporter of electricity, meaning that
Arkansas power plants produced more electricity than it consumed. In 2000 and 2005, Arkansas was a net importer
of electricity. Based on the approval of the GCGW, the final reference case forecast assumes that Arkansas is selfsufficient in electricity production, and that there will be no net imports over the revised forecast period (2006–
2025). For the purpose of estimating emissions, natural gas-fired generation is assumed to fill any gaps in the supply
of electricity to meet Arkansas demand during the forecast period. Thus, for the forecast, production- and
consumption-based emissions are the same.
4

“Additional benefits and costs” were defined as those borne by entities other than those implementing the policy
recommendation. These indirect effects were quantified on a case-by-case basis, depending on magnitude,
importance, need, and availability of data.

1-7

Additional Costs and Benefits: The GCGW recommendations were guided by four decision
criteria that included GHG reductions and monetized costs and cost savings of various policies,
as well as other potential co-benefits and costs (e.g., social, economic, and environmental) and
feasibility considerations. The TWGs were asked to examine the latter two in qualitative terms
where deemed important and quantify them on a case-by-case basis, as needed, depending on
need and where data were readily available.
Implementation Mechanisms: The analysis for each recommendation (see Appendices F
through J) of the GCGW includes guidance on the policy instruments or “mechanisms” that were
prescribed or assumed for the policy action. This includes a range of potential mechanisms
including, for instance, funding incentives, codes and standards, voluntary and negotiated
agreements, market based instruments, information and education, reporting and disclosure, and
other instruments. In some cases, the recommended instruments are precise. In other cases, they
are more general and envision further work to develop concrete programs and steps to achieve
the goals recommended by the GCGW.

Arkansas GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
In May 2008, CCS completed a draft GHG emissions inventory and reference case projection to
assist the GCGW and TWGs in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG emissions
in Arkansas, and thereby inform the policy development process. 5 The GCGW and TWGs
reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and projections methodologies, as well as
alternative data and approaches for improving the draft inventory and projections. The inventory
and reference case projections were revised to address the comments approved by the GCGW,
and were subsequently approved by the GCGW at its 10th meeting on September 25, 2008. 6
The inventory and reference case projections included detailed coverage of all economic sectors
and GHGs in Arkansas, including future emission trends and assessment issues related to energy,
the economy, and population growth. The assessment included estimates of total statewide
“gross emissions” (leaving aside carbon sequestration 7 ) on a production basis for all sources and
on a consumption basis for the electricity sector. (See prior discussion under “Analysis of Policy
Recommendations” in this chapter for an explanation of the production versus consumption
approach.) Further discussion of the issues involved in developing the inventory and reference
case projections is summarized in Chapter 2 (Inventory and Forecast of GHG Emissions) and
discussed in detail in the final report for the inventory and reference case projections.

Sequestration refers to the storing of carbon in mines, brine strata, oceans, plants, and soil. As trees and other
plants grow, they remove CO2 (the principal GHG) from the atmosphere, transforming the carbon through
photosynthesis into cellulose, starch, and sugars, thus sequestering it in their structures and roots. The oxygen is
released back into the atmosphere. Arkansas’ forests and agricultural lands are capable of sequestering much CO2,
as described in Chapter 7 (Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management).

1-8

The inventory and reference case projections revealed substantial emission growth rates and
related mitigation challenges. Figure 1-2 shows the reference case projections for Arkansas’
gross GHG emissions as rising fairly steeply to 114 MMtCO2e by 2025, growing by 74% over
1990 levels. Figure 1-2 also provides the sectoral breakdown of projected GHG emissions.
The inventory and reference case projections of Arkansas’ GHG emissions provided the
following critical findings:
!

As is common in many states, the electricity and transportation sectors have the largest
emissions, and their emissions are expected to continue to grow faster than in other sectors.

!

From 2005 to 2025, emissions associated with electricity generation to meet both in-state and
out-of-state demand are projected to be the largest contributor to future emissions growth,
followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector. Other sources of emissions
growth include the RCI fuel use sectors, the transmission and distribution of natural gas, and
the increasing use of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons as substitutes for ozonedepleting substances in refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications.

While Arkansas’ estimated emissions growth rate presents challenges, it also provides major
opportunities. Key choices regarding technologies and infrastructure can have a significant
impact on emissions growth in Arkansas. The GCGW’s recommendations document the
opportunities for the state to reduce its GHG emissions, while continuing its strong economic
growth by being more energy efficient, using more renewable energy sources, and increasing the
use of cleaner transportation modes, technologies, and fuels.

GCGW Policy Recommendations (Beyond Recent Actions)
The GCGW recommended 54 policy actions. The GCGW members present and voting approved
28 policy actions unanimously, approved 23 by a super majority (five objections or fewer), and
approved 3 by a majority (fewer than half object). Explanations of objections are in Appendices
F through J of this report, which contain detailed accounts of the GCGW’s recommendations.
A total of 31 of the 54 policy recommendations were analyzed quantitatively to estimate their
effects on emissions. Of these 31 analyzed for their emission reductions, 29 were analyzed
quantitatively to estimate their costs or cost savings. The 31 recommendations for which
emission reductions were quantified were estimated to have a cumulative effect of reducing
emissions by about 17.6 MMtCO2e in 2015, 35.5 MMtCO2e in 2020, and 53.3 MMtCO2e in
2025.
Figure 1-3 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the recent federal actions and the 31 policy recommendations relative to the
business-as-usual reference case projections. Table 1-2 provides the numeric estimates
underlying Figure 1-3. In Figure 1-3:

The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
2020, and 2025) levels of Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis. (The
consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Arkansas to meet the state’s demand for electricity)

!

The red line shows projected emissions associated with recent federal actions that were
analyzed quantitatively.

!

The green line shows projected emissions if all of the GCGW’s 31 recommendations that
were analyzed quantitatively with respect to their GHG reduction potential are implemented
successfully and the estimated reductions are fully achieved. (Note that other GCGW
recommendations would have the effect of reducing emissions, but those reductions were not
analyzed quantitatively, so are not reflected in the green line.)

!

The black line shows the projected emission level associated with the GCGW’s
recommendation for Arkansas to adopt a statewide, economy-wide global warming pollutant
reduction goal to reduce the state’s gross GHG emissions below 2000 levels by 20% by
2020, 35% by 2025, and 50% by 2035. Together, if the 31 quantified policy
recommendations and the recent federal actions (or their equivalent) are successfully
implemented, the 2020 emission reduction goal would be achieved, and the 2025 GHG
emission reduction goal would come very close to being achieved, based on results of
analysis of GCGW proposals conducted through the GCGW and TWG process.

For the policies recommended by the GCGW to yield the levels of estimated emission reductions
shown in Table 1-3, they must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.

implemented. It is expected that Titles IV and V measures will overlap with RCI policies, especially RCI-2b, RCI-3a,
RCI-3b, RCI-4a, and RCI-4b.

The values in this table do not include the effects of recent actions. Negative values in the Net Present Value and the
Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings associated with the policy recommendations.
Within each sector, values have been adjusted to eliminate double counting for policies or elements of policies that
overlap. In addition, values associated with policies or elements of policies within a sector that overlap with policies or
elements of policies in another sector have been adjusted to eliminate double counting. Appendix G (for the RCI
sectors), Appendix J (for the AFW sectors), and Appendix I (for the TLU sectors) of this report provide documentation
of how sector-level emission reductions and costs (or cost savings) were adjusted to eliminate double counting
associated with overlaps between policies.

Perspectives on Policy Recommendations
As explained above, the GCGW considered the estimates of the GHG reductions that could be
achieved by 31 of its recommendations, and the costs (or cost savings) of 29 of those 31. Figure
1-4 presents the estimated tons of GHG emission reductions for each policy recommendation for
which estimates were quantified, expressed as a cumulative figure for the period 2009–2025. In
addition to the imprecision in GHG reductions achieved by each policy recommendation, there
are uncertainties about the exact cost (or cost savings) per ton of reduction achieved. Figure 1-5
presents the estimated dollars-per-ton cost (or cost savings, depicted as a negative number) for
each policy recommendation for which cost estimates were quantified, expressed as a cumulative
figure for the period 2009–2025. This measure is calculated by dividing the net present value of
the cost of the policy recommendation by the cumulative GHG reductions, all for the period
2009–2025.
1-17

Figure 1-6 presents a stepwise marginal cost curve for Arkansas. The horizontal axis represents
the percentage of GHG emissions reduction in 2025 for each option relative to the business as
usual (BAU) forecast. The vertical axis represents the marginal cost of mitigation (expressed as
the cost-effectiveness of each policy recommendation on a cumulative basis, 2009-2025). In the
figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual policy. The width of the segment
indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the option in percentage terms. The height of
the segment relative to the x-axis shows the average cost (saving) of reducing one MMtCO2e of
GHG emissions with the application of the option.

Summary of Current Scientific Literature on Causes and Impacts of
Global Warming
All panels of scientists that have reviewed the science of climate change have concluded that
there is a 90 to 95% probability that human activities have increased amounts of important
GHGs (primarily CO2, CH4, N2O, and fluorocarbons) in the atmosphere to levels not seen in all
of prior human experience, and likely not seen for 3 million years. See, Fourth Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2007) and in at least three reports of the
National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS/NRC), Climate Change
Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (2001) (“Climate Change Science”), NAS/NRC,
Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years (2006); NAS/NRC, Abrupt
Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises (2002). These findings are also reflected in the summary
of science prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) in the Advance
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the Clean Air

1-20

Act, 73 Fed. Reg. 44354 (July 30, 2008). Scientists have already observed increased temperatures
and a variety of related effects and, because GHGs have very long residence times in the
atmosphere, if no action is taken to restrict emissions, impacts are likely to increase dramatically.
There are a variety of impacts that are expected to affect Arkansas. These include increases in
severe weather events and drought, which, in turn, can be expected to adversely affect
agriculture. Floods are expected to increase in frequency with related expansion of floodplains
and flood damage. Sea level rise will inundate some nearby coastal areas, and related salt-water
intrusion, coupled with increased drought stress may impact water supplies. In areas dependent
on snow pack, such as the western United States, water supplies will be more severely affected.
Ecosystems and sensitive species could be disrupted as climatic zones move north. Tropical
diseases and insects will move north. Heat-related deaths will increase, although cold-related
deaths will decrease. Climate change impacts in volatile regions of the world could destabilize
these areas and pose a national security threat. There is also a possibility of sudden and dramatic
climate change that cannot be predicted, but would have far greater adverse impacts.
Although there are books and articles in the popular press that raise questions about climate
change, none have been scientifically peer reviewed. The body of literature that has undergone
peer review is virtually unanimous in concluding that human activities have affected climate and
that the effects will increase if anthropogenic GHG emissions are not reduced. None of the
skeptics will say to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that emissions of GHGs will not
have adverse impacts. The applicable legal standards require action if adverse impacts can be
reasonably anticipated. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 7408(a)(1) (“air pollution which may reasonably be
anticipated to endanger public health or welfare”), 7411(b)(1)(A) (same), 7521(a)(1) (same),
7547(a)(1)(same), 7571(a)(2)(A)(same); see also United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, art. 3, §3.

Chapter 2
Inventory and Projections of GHG Emissions
Introduction
This chapter summarizes Arkansas’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks (carbon storage)
from 1990 to 2025. The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared a draft of Arkansas’ GHG
emissions inventory and reference case projections for the Arkansas Governor’s Commission on
Global Warming (GCGW). The draft inventory and reference case projections, completed in
May 2008, provided the GCGW with an initial, comprehensive understanding of current and
possible future GHG emissions. The draft report was provided to the GCGW and its Technical
Work Groups (TWGs) to assist them in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG
emissions in Arkansas, and thereby inform the policy recommendation development process.
The GCGW and TWGs have reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and
methodologies, as well as alternative data and approaches for improving the draft GHG
inventory and forecast. The inventory and forecast have since been revised to address the
comments provided by the GCGW. The information in this chapter reflects the information
presented in the final Arkansas Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections
report (hereafter referred to as the Inventory and Projections report). 1
Historical GHG emission estimates (1990 through 2005) 2 were developed using a set of
generally accepted principles and guidelines for state GHG emission inventories, relying to the
extent possible on Arkansas-specific data and inputs. The reference case projections (2006–
2025) are based on a compilation of various existing projections of electricity generation, fuel
use, and other GHG-emitting activities, along with a set of simple, transparent assumptions
described in the final Inventory and Projections report.
The Inventory and Projections report covers the six types of gases included in the U.S. GHG
inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential-weighted basis. 3

The last year of available historical data for each sector varies between 2000 and 2005.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth–atmosphere system. Holding everything else constant,
increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the
absorption of energy by the Earth). See: Boucher, O., et al. "Radiative Forcing of Climate Change." Chapter 6 in
Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Contribution of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, United Kingdom. Available at:

It is important to note that the emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with the
electricity sources used to meet Arkansas’ demands, corresponding to a consumption-based
approach to emissions accounting. Another way to look at electricity emissions is to consider the
GHG emissions produced by electricity generation facilities in the state—a production-based
method. The study covers both methods of accounting for emissions, but for consistency, all total
results are reported as consumption-based.

Arkansas GHG Emissions: Sources and Trends
Table 2-1 provides a summary of GHG emissions estimated for Arkansas by sector for 1990,
2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2025. As shown in this table, Arkansas is estimated to be a
net source of GHG emissions (positive, or gross, emissions). Arkansas’ forests serve as sinks of
GHG emissions (removal of emissions, or negative emissions). Arkansas’ net emissions subtract
the equivalent GHG reduction from emission sinks from the gross GHG emission totals. The
following sections discuss GHG emission sources and sinks, trends, projections, and
uncertainties.

Historical Emissions
Overview
In 2005, on a gross emissions consumption basis (i.e., excluding carbon sinks), Arkansas
accounted for approximately 85 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2e emissions, an amount equal
to 1.2% of total U.S. gross GHG emissions. On a net emissions basis (i.e., including carbon
sinks), Arkansans accounted for approximately 65 MMtCO2e of emissions in 2005, an amount
equal to 1.0% of total U.S. net GHG emissions.4 Arkansas’ GHG emissions are rising faster than
those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005, Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions increased by
30%, while national gross emissions rose by 16%.5
On a per-capita basis, Arkansans emitted about 31 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 2005, higher
than the national average of about 24 tCO2e. Figure 2-1 illustrates the state’s emissions per capita
and per unit of economic output. It also shows that while per-capita emissions have increased
from 1990 to 2000 in Arkansas and then began to decrease from 2000 to 2005, per capita
emissions for the nation as a whole remained fairly flat from 1990 to 2005. The higher per capita
emission rates in Arkansas are driven by emissions growth in the electricity supply,
transportation, and agricultural sectors (agricultural sector emissions are twice the national
average). In both Arkansas and the nation as a whole, economic growth exceeded emissions
growth throughout the 1990–2005 period. From 1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross
product dropped by 26% nationally, and by 23% in Arkansas. 6

The national emissions used for these comparisons are based on 2005 emissions from U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2006, April 15, 2008, EPA430R-08-005. Available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html.

During this period, population grew by 18% in Arkansas and by 19% nationally. However, Arkansas’ economy
grew at a faster rate on a per capita basis (up 44% vs. 32% nationally).

The principal sources of Arkansas’ GHG emissions in 2005 are electricity consumption and
transportation, accounting for 32% and 26% of Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions, respectively, as
shown in Figure 2-2. The direct use of fuels—natural gas, oil products, coal, and wood—in the
residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors accounts for another 18% of the state’s
emissions in 2005.

Figure 2-2 shows the agricultural and forest wildfire (including prescribed burning) sectors
together accounted for 14% of the gross GHG emissions in Arkansas in 2005. These CH4 and
N2O emissions primarily come from agricultural soils, rice cultivation, enteric fermentation, and
manure management. Industrial process emissions accounted for another 5% of the state’s GHG
emissions in 2005, and these emissions are rising due to the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as
substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. 7 Other industrial process emissions include
CO2 released by cement and lime manufacturing; CO2 released during soda ash, limestone, and
dolomite use; CO2 released during ammonia, urea, and iron and steel production; N2O released
during nitric acid production; and SF6 released from transformers used in electricity transmission
and distribution systems. Also, landfills and wastewater management facilities produce CH4 and
N2O emissions that accounted for 3% of total gross GHG emissions in Arkansas in 2005.
Similarly, emissions associated with the production, processing, transmission, and distribution of
fossil fuels accounted for 3% of the gross GHG emissions in 2005.

Forestry emissions refer to the net CO2 flux 8 from forested lands in Arkansas, which account for
about 56% of the state’s land area. 9 Arkansas’ forests are estimated to be net sinks of CO2
emissions in the state, reducing net GHG emissions by 19 MMtCO2e in 2005. In addition,
estimates of net carbon fluxes from agricultural soil cultivation practices are estimated to be net
7

Chlorofluorocarbons are also potent GHGs; however, they are not included in GHG estimates because of concerns
related to implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Affect the Ozone Layer. See Appendix I in
the Final Inventory and Projections report for Arkansas
(http://www.arclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm).

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.

consider above-ground carbon sequestration in agriculture because it is not considered to be
sequestered. 10

Reference Case Projections
Relying on a variety of sources for projections, as noted in the Inventory and Projections report,
a simple reference case projection of GHG emissions through 2025 was developed. As illustrated
in Figure 2-3 and shown numerically in Table 2-1, under the reference case projections,
Arkansas’ gross GHG emissions continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 114 MMtCO2e by
2025, or 74% above 1990 levels. This equates to a 1.6% annual rate of growth from 1990 to
2025. By 2025, the share of emissions associated with electricity consumption and the
transportation sector both increase slightly to 33% and 27%, respectively; emissions from the
residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use and agriculture sectors both decrease to
16% and 10%, respectively.
Emissions associated with electricity consumption are projected to be the largest contributor to
future GHG emissions growth, followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector,
as shown in Figure 2-4. Other sources of emissions growth include the increasing use of HFCs
and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in refrigeration, air conditioning, and
other applications, as well as the RCI fuel use sector. Table 2-2 summarizes the growth rates that
drive the growth in the Arkansas reference case projections, as well as the sources of these data.

10

Above-ground carbon re-enters the natural carbon cycle and is lost to the atmosphere through respiration or
decomposition either directly or indirectly (e.g., used as energy as animal feed or by humans) over relatively short
periods of time (months to years). Carbon sequestration in agriculture is below ground in the form of soil carbon
(i.e., the result of the photosynthesis process), where carbon can be stored over long periods of time (potentially
indefinitely). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Web sites
http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/ccyle.html and http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/local_scale.html have some
useful information. For additional information on the potential for sequestration in agriculture, see EPA’s
Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential in U.S. Forestry and Agriculture
(http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/pdf/greenhousegas2005.pdf).

A Closer Look at the Two Major Sources: Electricity Supply and Transportation
As shown in Figure 2-2, electricity use in 2005 accounted for 32% of Arkansas’ gross GHG
emissions (about 27 MMtCO2e), which was very similar to the national share of emissions from
electricity generation (34%). On a per-capita basis, Arkansas’ GHG emissions from electricity
consumption are higher than the national average (in 2005, 9.8 tCO2e per capita in Arkansas,
versus 8.1 tCO2e per capita nationally). Electricity generation in Arkansas is dominated by steam
units, which are primarily powered by coal and nuclear fuel. In 2005, 45% of Arkansas'
electricity generation was provided by coal-fired units, with another 27% of generation provided
by nuclear units. The remaining in-state generation came from a mix of natural gas,
hydroelectric, biomass, oil, and refuse-derived fuel facilities. 11
As noted above, these electricity emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with
the electricity sources used to meet Arkansas’ demand for electricity, corresponding to a
consumption-based approach to emissions accounting. From 1990 to 1999 and from 2001 to
2004, Arkansas was a net exporter of electricity, meaning that Arkansas power plants have
produced more electricity than is consumed in the state. 12 For 2000 and 2005, Arkansas was a
11

Percentages are based on gross generation (including plant fuel use) associated with the electricity produced by
facilities in Arkansas.
12

Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in state and out of state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimates reflect some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A of the Inventory and Projections report.

2-8

net importer of electricity. Based on the approval of the GCGW, the final reference case forecast
assumes that Arkansas is self-sufficient in electricity production, and that there will be no net
imports over the revised forecast period (2006–2025). For the purpose of estimating emissions,
natural gas-fired generation is assumed to fill any gaps in the supply of electricity to meet
Arkansas demand during the forecast period.
While estimates are provided for emissions from both electricity production and consumption,
unless otherwise indicated, tables, figures, and totals in this report reflect electricity consumption
emissions. The consumption-based approach can better reflect the emissions (and emission
reductions) associated with activities occurring in the state, particularly with respect to electricity
use (and efficiency improvements), and is particularly useful for decision making. Under this
approach, emissions associated with electricity exported to other states would need to be covered
in those states’ inventories in order to avoid double counting or exclusions.
Like electricity emissions, GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily from
1990 to 2005, at an average annual growth rate of 1.8%. In 2005, gasoline-powered on-road
vehicles accounted for about 57% of transportation GHG emissions; on-road diesel vehicles for
28%; marine vessels for 8%; aviation fuels for 2%; and rail and other sources (natural gas- and
liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles used in transport applications) for the remaining 5%. As
a result of Arkansas’ population and economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles
traveled, emissions from on-road gasoline use grew at a rate of 0.91% annually between 1990
and 2005. Meanwhile, emissions from on-road diesel use rose by 3.2% per year from 1990 to
2005, suggesting an even more rapid growth in freight movement within or across the state.
Emissions from on-road gasoline vehicles in 2025 are projected to increase by 1.4% annually
from 2005 levels, and emissions from on-road diesel vehicles are projected to increase by 2.9%
annually from 2005 to 2025, with total transportation emissions are expected to reach 31
MMtCO2e by 2025.

GCGW Revisions
The GCGW made the following revisions to the inventory and reference case projections, which
explain the differences between the final Inventory and Projections report and the draft initial
assessment completed during May 2008:
!

Energy Supply:
Gross coal-fired generation: The GCGW approved including both the Plum Point and
Hempstead County (Turk) coal plants in the reference case projections (both of these
plants were included in the May 2008 draft forecast). The GCGW revised the start year
for the plants, changing the on-line start date for Plum Point from 2009 to 2010 and for
Hempstead County from 2011 to 2012. The GCGW also approved a faster ramp-up of
output from the Plum Point and Hempstead plants relative to the draft forecast.
! Net imports: Assume no net imports (or exports) during the forecast period (2006–2025).
The draft forecast assumed Arkansas would be a net importer of electricity from 2005 to
2010 and a net exporter of electricity from 2011 to 2025.
! Gross natural gas-fired generation and primary energy use: Include natural gas
combined-cycle capacity to satisfy the criteria (1) that Arkansas be self-sufficient in
!

2-9

electricity production, and (2) that there are no net imports over the revised forecast
period (2006–2025) (the earlier forecast did not include this assumption).
! Gross oil-fired generation and primary energy use: About 20%–25% higher than the
draft forecast for 2006–2025.
! Gross nuclear generation and primary energy use: 36% less than the draft forecast in the
2020–2025 period.
! All other gross generation and primary energy use: About 3% higher than the draft
forecast for 2006–2025.
!

Agriculture:
A preliminary estimate was made of the likely emissions coming from catfish farms in
Arkansas. This emission estimate was relatively low and has been documented in
Appendix F of the Inventory and Projections report. However, the GCGW determined
that the uncertainty associated with this estimate was too great for these emissions to be
included in the overall agricultural emission totals included in this section of the report.
! Two additional tables have been added to Appendix F of the Inventory and Projections
report that categorize manure management emissions by pollutant (N2O and CH4) and by
animal (chicken, dairy, etc). This does not change the manure management emissions
total.

Waste Management:
Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) provided 2002–2005 municipal
solid waste (MSW) landfill disposal data, which were used in place of default EPA data.
! ADEQ also provided a growth rate for MSW landfill disposal, which replaced the
original growth rate that was based on historical data.

Key Uncertainties
Some data gaps exist in this inventory, and particularly in the reference case projections. Key
tasks for future refinement of this inventory and forecast include review and revision of key
drivers, such as the transportation, electricity demand, and RCI fuel use growth rates that will be
major determinants of Arkansas’ future GHG emissions (see Table 2-2 and Figure 2-4). These
growth rates are driven by uncertain economic, demographic, and land use trends (including
growth patterns and transportation system impacts), all of which deserve closer review and
discussion.

Chapter 3
Cross-Cutting Issues
Overview of Cross-Cutting Issues
Some issues relating to climate policy cut across multiple, or even all, sectors. The Arkansas
Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW) addressed such issues explicitly in a
separate Cross-Cutting Issues (CC) Technical Work Group (TWG). Cross-cutting
recommendations typically encourage, enable, or otherwise support emission mitigation
activities and/or other climate actions. The types of policies considered for this sector are not
readily quantifiable in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and costs or cost savings.
Nonetheless, if successfully implemented, they would most likely contribute to GHG emission
reductions and implementation of the GCGW’s policy recommendations described in Chapters
4–7 of this report.
The CC TWG developed recommendations for 11 policies (see Table 3-1) that were then
reviewed, revised, and ultimately adopted by the GCGW members present and voting. Ten of the
recommendations are focused on enabling GHG emission reductions and mitigation activities,
while one (CC-9 [Adaptation and Vulnerability]) addresses adaptation to the changes expected
from the effects of GHGs that will remain in the atmosphere for decades.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
In fulfilling one of its requirements under Arkansas Act 696, the GCGW recommends that by
2009 Arkansas adopt a statewide, economy-wide global warming pollutant reduction goal to
reduce the state’s gross GHG emissions below 2000 levels by 20% by 2020, 35% by 2025, and
50% by 2035. The GCGW based its recommendations on its review of the potential overall
emission reduction estimates (as compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast) for 31
of 54 policy recommendations for which emission reductions were quantified, and its review of
goals and targets adopted by several other states. While 23 other of the GCGW’s policy
recommendations were not readily quantifiable, some of them would most likely achieve
additional reductions, including several of the CC policy recommendations. In addition,
emerging technologies may hold the potential to reduce emissions even further.
An opportunity and a challenge is for Arkansas to establish the Arkansas Climate Change Center
(CC-9) to (1) collect and analyze data to monitor the effects of climate change in the state, and
(2) develop a plan to manage the projected impacts of climate change on the state and reduce the
state’s contribution to GHGs. In addition, the vision for the Center is to attract leading
researchers, scientists, economists, and policy analysts to support implementation of six other
CC policy recommendations (i.e., CC-3, CC-4, CC-7, CC-8, CC-10, and CC-11). The Center
could provide a significant coordination role with state and local governments, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and the private sector to avoid duplication of effort, along with the
research support needed to enable decision making on how best to implement policies to mitigate
GHG emissions as Arkansas works to achieve the recommended global warming pollutant
reduction goals. The GCGW recommends that the Governor’s Office seek government and
private funding to support establishment of the Center as soon as possible. Until the Center is
3-1

established, the GCGW recommends that the state decide on the appropriate lead agency or
agencies for implementing the GCGW-recommended CC policies.

Establishing a GHG inventory and forecast function within state government is an essential
element of understanding where emission reduction opportunities lie, identifying what emission
trends are developing, and tracking the effectiveness of policies that the state adopts and
implements to reduce GHG emissions. The preparation of periodic inventories and forecasts will
most likely require additional resources. These resources are minimized, but not eliminated by,
adding implementation of this recommendation to the existing emissions inventory duties of the
Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ).

3-2

Opportunities exist for sources of GHG emissions in Arkansas to participate in a GHG registry to
identify emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks, and potentially develop revenue
associated with possible future GHG mandates by developing the required infrastructure in
advance for documenting GHG reduction credits. Tracking and reporting GHG emissions can
also help in the implementation of periodic state GHG inventories. Thus, the GCGW includes a
recommendation for all sources of GHG emissions in Arkansas (including state government
agencies) to voluntarily participate in a GHG reduction registry.
To support this policy, the GCGW recommends that the state join a registry as a member
organization to develop knowledge of the reporting mechanism, reporting costs, registry
requirements, and resource demands to inform Arkansas' sources of GHG emissions. Should the
state join The Climate Registry as a member organization, along with 39 other U.S. states, the
Governor’s Office [Should governor’s office be initially capitalized?] and The Climate Registry
will need to consult on the per-capita-based membership fee.
The GCGW acknowledges that implementation of some of its recommendations will require
additional up-front investment of resources, as well as identifying mechanisms that will save
energy and money, create “green” jobs, and consider regional approaches for Arkansas. To
address these concerns, the GCGW has included recommendations to identify and implement
creative financial mechanisms (CC-8), provide climate change-related economic development
opportunities (CC-10), and optimize best scale-of-reduction policies (CC-7). For CC-8, the
GCGW recommends that the state legislature establish a board to identify and procure funding
from a broad range of sources to support implementation of this policy recommendation, with a
goal to establish funding for this policy by mid-2009. For CC-10, the GCGW recommends that
the state legislature allocate basic seed money by the end of the 2009 legislative session to
facilitate implementation of this policy.
Ultimately, many strategies for reducing GHG emissions will need to be developed and
implemented by local communities. Thus, the GCGW has included in its set of CC
recommendations a policy to encourage and support local governments and communities to
develop plans to address GHG emissions. In so doing, the GCGW recommends that the state (1)
provide resources and materials to educate community planning and zoning officials about
climate change, impacts, and opportunities; and (2) identify and work with local government
leaders, model municipalities, and community-based organizations that have expertise or interest
in climate-related issues to build local community capacity to mitigate GHG emissions.
Public education and outreach will be the foundation for the long-term success of many efforts to
reduce GHGs. The GCGW recommends that the Governor form a climate literacy education and
outreach committee (coordinated by ADEQ and supported by outreach coordinators from all
state agencies) to educate the public and other audiences regarding the state’s climate change
action plan and associated policies, and to oversee outreach activities.
Finally, the GCGW has included recommendations for two policies providing the state the
opportunity to “lead by example.” One policy (CC-4) calls for state and local government
operations and school districts (including universities) to establish GHG reduction targets
consistent with the GHG emission reduction levels that the GCGW recommends for statewide
GHG reduction goals or targets. Implementation of this policy will be helpful in setting an
3-3

example for NGOs, while identifying opportunities for reducing energy costs. The second policy
(CC-11) calls for the Governor to conduct a review of state policies and regulations to identify
opportunities for realigning them to remove impediments to climate-friendly options. It also
recommends that state agencies identify opportunities to utilize incentives to minimize the
carbon footprint of state government, as well as entities affected by state government regulations
and policies (e.g., local governments and the private sector).

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
Cross-cutting issues include policies that apply across the board to all sectors and activities.
Cross-cutting recommendations typically encourage, enable, or otherwise support emission
mitigation activities and/or other climate actions. The GCGW recommends that 11 such policies
be adopted and implemented by Arkansas. All are enabling policies that are not quantified in
terms of tons of GHG reduction or costs.
Detailed descriptions of the individual CC policy recommendations as presented to and approved
by the GCGW can be found in Appendix F of this report.

Cross-Cutting Issues
Policy Descriptions

CC-1.

Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Forecasts

Greenhouse gas emission inventories and forecasts are essential to understanding the magnitude
of all emission sources and sinks (both natural and those resulting from human endeavors), the
relative contribution of various types of emission sources and sinks to total emissions, and the
factors that affect trends over time. Inventories and forecasts help to inform state leaders and the
public on statewide trends, opportunities for mitigating emissions or enhancing sinks, and
verifying GHG reductions associated with implementation of the GCGW’s policy
recommendations.
The GCGW recommends that the state develop an inventory and forecast system that is aligned
with national protocols and tailored to specific emissions/sinks found in Arkansas. In so doing,
the state should coordinate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the
development of a mandatory federal GHG reporting rule. In addition, the GCGW recommends
that the state refine the GHG inventory for previous and current time periods, as needed, to
support implementation of the policy recommendations by the GCGW, until the EPA reporting
requirements on GHG emission inventories and forecasts become clear. The state should develop
a benchmark emissions estimate and associated gap analysis for all years, and identify missing
data and/or additional information required. The inventory and forecast function should be
integrated with existing related functions, such as those carried out by ADEQ, which develops
inventories for the criteria air pollutants.
CC-2.

State Greenhouse Gas Reporting and Registry

Greenhouse gas reporting reflects the measurement and reporting of GHG emissions to support
both goal development and tracking and management of emissions. GHG reporting can help
sources identify emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks, and potentially develop revenue
associated with possible future GHG mandates by developing the required infrastructure in
advance. Tracking and reporting GHG emissions can also help in the implementation of periodic
state GHG inventories.
GHG reporting is a precursor for sources of GHG emissions to participate in GHG reduction
programs, opportunities for recognition, and a GHG emission reduction registry, as well as to
secure “baseline protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions). A GHG registry enables recording
of GHG emission reductions in a central repository with “transaction ledger” capacity to support
tracking, management, and “ownership” of emission reductions; establish baseline protection;
enable recognition of environmental leadership; and/or provide a mechanism for regional,
multistate, and cross-border cooperation. Properly designed registry structures also provide a
foundation for possible future trading programs.

3-5

The GCGW recommends that the state participate in a nationally recognized, voluntary reporting
and registry program (e.g., The Climate Registry) to develop knowledge of the reporting
mechanism, reporting costs, registry requirements, and resource demands. To the extent that
Arkansas’ needs may not be fully met by a national reporting and registry program for sources or
sinks/offsets (e.g., the agricultural and forestry sectors) that are specific to Arkansas, the state
should consider developing supplemental or ancillary registry capacity or opportunities to enable
their participation in a registry.
The GCGW also recommends that state government entities join a registry as an emissions
reporter to register its own emission reductions, and facilitate and encourage voluntary
participation in a reporting and a registry program by other public and private entities (e.g., local
governments, academic and nonprofit institutions, and businesses and regulated industries). The
state should make every effort to avoid duplication of reporting requirements on owners or
operators of emission sources or sinks by relying on the use of data that emission sources already
report under existing state and federal programs, and should seek opportunities to participate
with the EPA in developing federal requirements for reporting GHG emissions.
CC-3.

Statewide Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals or Targets

Section 5 (Purpose and duties) of Arkansas Act 696 requires the GCGW to set forth a global
warming pollutant reduction goal based on the GCGW's evaluation of the current global
warming data, the assessment of global warming mitigation strategies, and the available global
warming pollutant reduction strategies. 1 Consistent with this charge, the establishment of a
statewide goal or target can provide vision and direction, a framework within which
implementation of GCGW policy recommendations can proceed effectively, and a basis of
comparison for periodic assessments of progress. Greenhouse gas reduction goals or targets
recommended by the GCGW should be consistent with the parallel goal of an efficient, robust
Arkansas economy.
The GCGW recommends that Arkansas establish a statewide, economy-wide goal to reduce the
state’s gross GHG emissions below 2000 levels by 20% by 2020, 35% by 2025, and 50% by
2035. These goals should be adopted by the state by 2009. The GCGW recommends that the
Arkansas Climate Change Center prepare a report to the Governor and the state legislature once
every 2 years on the state’s progress toward achieving the statewide GHG reduction goal, in
coordination with ADEQ and other state agencies, as appropriate. This report should address
each sector’s progress toward reducing GHG emissions; identify the contribution of each sector’s
emissions (as noted in the GHG inventory and forecast report) toward achieving the statewide
goal; and specify future actions and resource needs.

The State’s Own Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Lead by Example)

As a "lead by example" policy, the GCGW recommends that state and local government
operations and school districts (including universities) begin immediately to establish GHG
reduction targets consistent with the GHG emission reduction levels that the GCGW
recommends for statewide GHG reduction goals or targets. Establishing these targets will be
helpful in setting an example for NGOs, and will help agencies to focus on doing the necessary
analysis.
Reductions should be reported at the agency level. Thus, state and local government agencies or
departments would first need to develop agency- or department-specific GHG emissions
inventory data, ideally building on existing energy use reporting data. This would become the
baseline data for ongoing emission reduction activities and measurement, which could be
included in annual reporting for all entities. Agency and/or department reports would be
aggregated into a summary report reflecting state GHG emissions.
The Arkansas Climate Change Center should oversee the ongoing climate efforts of the state
government’s agencies or departments; review their performance; and provide direction,
guidance, resources, shared approaches, and recognition to agencies or departments and their
employees working to reduce the state government’s GHG emissions.
CC-5.

Comprehensive Local Government Climate Action Plans

“Think globally, act locally” is the refrain often heard to bring action to bear on environmental
issues within the average individual’s ability. Similarly, local government actions on climate
change issues will be a keystone for achieving state and federal climate action goals. No single
approach can be universally applied at the local level; however, local communities are often the
incubators for new approaches that can be further developed and applied on a larger level. Local
governments will report on progress on climate change issues and will provide innovative,
multisector solutions that will be shared with others through a clearinghouse or other
mechanisms. Arkansas will provide encouragement and assistance to local jurisdictions to
sustain global warming objectives.
Beginning in 2009, the GCGW recommends that Arkansas provide resources and materials to
educate community planning and zoning officials about climate change, impacts, and
opportunities. Regional meetings will be conducted to train local officials, discuss the state’s
global warming program, and review other jurisdictions' approaches and lessons learned, to
emphasize assistance and resources and to underscore the value of collaboration.
A key initial goal of this recommendation is for Arkansas to identify and work with local
government leaders, model municipalities, and community-based organizations that have
expertise or interest in climate-related issues to build local capacity for developing and
implementing local efforts to mitigate GHG emissions. The state will host events periodically
that focus on leading by example, sharing specifics on lessons learned and opportunities, and
illustrating financial investments and payback, co-benefits, etc. Development and
implementation of local plans will help Arkansas achieve its statewide GHG emission reduction
3-7

goals. If local governments include energy efficiency and renewable and clean energy actions in
their plans, these actions have multiple benefits, including saving money, creating jobs,
promoting sustainable growth, and reducing emissions of GHGs and other air pollutants.
CC-6.

State Climate Public Education and Outreach

The key for long-term success of Arkansas’ strategies for addressing climate change lies with
increasing the awareness of the issue, as well as the societal costs of and benefits from adopting
new policies and/or goals. Education of Arkansas’ citizens, business leaders, and policymakers is
integral to the successful implementation of changes to mitigate the effects of climate change on
the state's environment, economy, and lifestyle. Outreach will extend Arkansans’ personal and
cooperative commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change to all sectors of endeavor, as
well as to future generations.
Starting in 2009, the GCGW recommends that Arkansas develop climate change educational and
outreach objectives for implementation in 2010 for the following target audiences:
!

State Executive Agencies—The Governor should form a climate literacy education and
outreach committee (coordinated by ADEQ) to educate the public and other audiences
regarding the state’s climate change action plan and associated policies, and to oversee
outreach activities. The committee should consist of appointed members, and should be
supported by outreach coordinators from relevant state agencies (energy supply, forestry,
agriculture, etc.).

!

General Public—Arkansas should increase the public’s awareness of and engagement in
climate change actions in their personal and professional lives.

!

Future Generations—Arkansas should integrate climate change into educational curricula,
post-secondary degree programs, and professional licensing to address the multidisciplinary
approach to reduce adverse climate change effects.

Climate literacy education and outreach would utilize the same practices as existing ADEQ
practices. ADEQ has an established network for education and outreach for issues similar to
climate literacy (e.g., pollution prevention, clean air). The education and outreach program
would include aspects of global warming actions developed from other sectors (i.e., forestry,
energy supply, agriculture). Collaboration with NGOs will facilitate public education and
outreach, and ensure that climate education is coordinated enough to be broadly effective.
CC-7.

Optimizing Best Scale-of-Reduction Policies

This policy recommends that Arkansas, through the assistance of the Climate Change Center,
investigate optimization of scale for each specific GHG reduction considered by the state, and
report its findings annually. These investigations should include interstate and regional
opportunities that optimize GHG reductions. For the purpose of this policy recommendation,
“optimization” should be interpreted as opportunities that further increase the state’s overall
reduction goals by at least 1% per year, or accelerate the achievement of certain goals by at least
one year.
3-8

CC-8.

Creative Financial Mechanisms

Allocation of some resources under existing state programs and initiatives can be targeted to
achieving state climate goals. However, it is likely that additional resources may be needed to
implement the GCGW’s recommendations. Therefore, the state and others will need to consider
seeking and stimulating additional funding and investment in climate solutions. Initiatives could
include (but are not limited to) establishing, promoting, and utilizing creative financing
mechanisms for projects and products that reduce GHGs. Examples could include establishing a
State Revolving Loan Fund to finance products and services with low-carbon intensity,
promoting the use of “green products” procurement preferences, and establishing and promoting
greener buying cooperatives.
The GCGW recommends that Arkansas establish a board to identify and procure funding from a
broad range of sources to support implementation of this policy recommendation, with a goal to
establish funding for this policy by mid-2009. The state should also survey options within
existing state economic development plans appropriate to support GHG mitigation polices within
Arkansas.
CC-9.

Adaptation and Vulnerability

The GCGW recommends establishing the Arkansas Climate Change Center for collecting and
analyzing data to monitor the effects of climate change on Arkansas, using the data to develop a
plan to manage the projected impacts of climate change on Arkansas and reducing the Arkansas’
contribution to GHGs. Along with existing local, state, and federal agencies, the Arkansas
Climate Change Center will help to address the impact of climate change. The impact issues
would include identifying the climate change risks to humans (e.g., factors that could contribute
to disease); water resources (e.g., risk factors that could cause flooding, drought, pollution of
waterways); temperature-sensitive populations (e.g., factors that could place
immunocompromised individuals at even greater health risks); and ecosystems (e.g., animals and
plants that may be affected by changes in their environment).
Along with these adverse changes in the natural environment, climate change could also harm
Arkansas' energy, transportation, and communication systems; vital infrastructure (including
public facilities); and entire economy. The analysis of these risks, along with occurring climate
change data, can be used to create a model to project future problems and hopefully develop
solutions to address these issues. The state should work with industries and research universities
to create the Arkansas Climate Change Center. The establishment of the Center should attract
more researchers and scientists to Arkansas to help stimulate industrial partners for new
economic development and to create new “green” jobs for Arkansans. Once established, the
Center could help to coordinate implementation of many of the GCGW’s recommendations.
CC-10.

Climate Change-Related Economic Development

Successful state GHG mitigation efforts are highly dependent on active participation of the
business community, particularly in the energy, agriculture, transportation, development, and
3-9

manufacturing sectors. The intent of this policy is to encourage and facilitate the involvement of
funding and investment sources, business interests, and entrepreneurs in pursuing business
opportunities associated with GHG mitigation and global warming solutions as quickly and as
significantly as possible.
Arkansas’ ability to identify and secure early business opportunities associated with climate
change may be enhanced, increasing its global competitive advantage and job creation within the
state. This policy recommendation includes five specific goals aimed at identifying and
leveraging economic development opportunities associated with GHG mitigation in Arkansas,
and a performance-based strategic management system to monitor progress.
The GCGW recommends that the state legislature allocate basic seed money by the end of the
2009 legislative session to facilitate implementation of this policy.
CC-11.

Regulatory Realignment in Government To Encourage Constructive Climate Action

This policy recommends that state government conduct a review of its policies and regulations to
identify opportunities for realigning them to remove impediments to climate-friendly options. In
addition, it recommends that state agencies identify opportunities to utilize incentives to
minimize the carbon footprint of state government, as well as entities affected by state
government regulations and policies (e.g., local governments and the private sector). Examples
include (but are not limited to) coordination and alignment among state agencies’ policies and
programs; reduced costs and/or time frames for greener permits; “performance-based”
regulations; and reducing or eliminating “throughput incentives,” so that regulated utilities are
compensated for demand-side reductions, not just supply-side activities.
This policy includes several specific recommendations, such as one for state agencies to conduct
audits of energy use and GHG emissions associated with state facilities and activities to establish
baseline levels needed to set achievable goals for reducing emissions. A second recommendation
is for the legislature and Governor to coordinate with ADEQ in formulating an amendment to the
definition of “air contaminant” in Chapter 2 of the Arkansas Air Pollution Control Code
(Regulation 18) to remove any barriers that prevent Arkansas from controlling CO2 emissions. 2
This policy will enable Arkansas to mitigate CO2 emissions, as well as to effectively coordinate
its GHG mitigation policies and programs with future regional and national policies and
programs. A third recommendation is for the legislature and governor to coordinate to remove
the 1999 exemption of Merchant Power Plants from the standard Arkansas Public Service
Commission’s process such that these plants would be required to substantiate that a public need
exists for the electricity they propose to generate and sell in Arkansas.

Chapter 4
Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Activities in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors produce GHG emissions
when fuels are combusted to provide space heating, process heating, and other applications. In
2005, combustion of oil, natural gas, coal, and wood in the RCI sectors contributed about 18%
(about 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent [MMtCO2e]) of Arkansas’ gross
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This sector is the third largest source of GHG emissions in the
state. 1 Industrial Process emissions are rising primarily due to the increasing use of
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). The
production of nitric acid results in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. In addition, sulfur hexafluoride
(SF6) is released in the use of electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment.
Together, industrial process emissions, including cement production and chemical
manufacturing, account for an additional 4.7% of Arkansas’s gross GHG emissions (4.03
MMtCO2e).
Considering only the direct emissions that occur within buildings and industries, however,
ignores the fact that nearly all electricity sold in the state is consumed as the result of RCI
activities. If the emissions from all three subsectors of RCI are included (i.e., direct fuel use,
emissions associated electricity consumption, and industrial processes), they total about 47% of
the state’s gross GHG emissions in 2005. Therefore, the state’s future GHG emissions will
depend heavily on future trends in the consumption of electricity and other fuels in these sectors.
Figure 4-1 shows the growth in GHG emissions by sector through 2025, including electricity use.
For the 20-year period, the fastest growth in GHG emissions is the commercial sector, which is
forecasted to grow at a 2.7% annual rate. GHG emissions in the residential sector are expected to
grow at 1.7%, and the industrial sector has the slowest growth in emissions, at slightly less than
1% a year. The net result of these differential growth rates is that industrial GHG emissions
decline from about 50% of Arkansas’ total emissions to about 45% by 2025, and emissions from
the commercial sector grows by over 50%, from nearly 9 MMtCO2e to over 13 MMtCO2e by
2025.
Much of the growth in GHG emissions over the period can be attributed an average 1.4% annual
growth in electricity demand over the 2005–2025 period for the RCI sectors. However,
electricity-related GHG emissions grow by 1.8% per year due to the addition of fossil fuel-based
generation resources. Residential GHG emissions from electricity grow by 2% per year,
commercial emissions grow by 3% per year, and industrial emissions grow by 0.9% per year.

1

Emissions associated with the electricity supply sector (discussed in Chapter 5) have been allocated to each of the
RCI sectors for comparison of those emissions to the emissions associated with direct fuel consumption. Note that
this comparison is provided for information purposes, and that emissions estimated for the electricity supply sector
are not double counted in the total emissions for the state.

Figure 4-2 shows the growth in GHG emissions by fuel type through 2025. For the 20-year
period, emissions in the sector are dominated by electricity supply, and rise by 37% from 27
MMtCO2e in 2005 to 37 MMtCO2e in 2025. Direct emissions from coal are forecasted to be
essentially unchanged (not including coal use for electricity generation), and emissions from
natural gas and petroleum increase by 1.3% and 0.6% per year, respectively. The emissions data
from natural gas mask large differences in the growth of the use of this fuel. Residential natural
gas consumption is expected to stay constant from 2005 to 2025, while commercial and
industrial gas use increases at 1.9% and 1.6% per year, respectively.

Consolidated Arkansas Inventory and Forecast.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The principal means to reduce RCI emissions include improving energy efficiency, substituting
electricity and natural gas with lower-emission energy resources (such as biomass and wind), and
various strategies to decrease the emissions associated with electricity production (see Chapter 5,
Energy Supply). The state’s limited pursuit of energy efficiency until recent years offers
abundant opportunities to reduce emissions through programs and initiatives to improve the
efficiency of buildings, appliances, and industrial practices. The advantages of having “low
hanging fruit” in the form of low cost energy efficiency opportunities in the RCI sectors are
countered by an underdeveloped private sector that will likely be responsible for scoping,
implementing, and evaluating energy efficiency projects. These green collar jobs require special
training and equipment that take time for firms within the state to acquire.
Arkansas has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to
concerns about energy costs. Ark. Code Ann. §§23-3-401 et seq. authorizes the Arkansas Public
Service Commission (APSC) to develop energy efficiency and conservation programs to address
high energy costs. In January 2007, APSC issued its energy efficiency and conservation plan
4-3

rules. The electric and gas utilities proposed a series of programs in July 2007, and the APSC
approved several energy efficiency and conservation programs. The total cost of the initial quickstart programs is approximately $18,530,924 for the initial 2-year period ending December 31,
2009. Municipal and cooperative electric utilities are also currently pursuing energy efficiency
programs.
The Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW) has identified significant
opportunities for reducing GHG emissions growth attributable to the RCI sectors in Arkansas.
These include expanding or launching energy efficiency programs for electricity, natural gas, and
other direct-use fuels; regularly updating building codes; requiring state and local governments
to implement beyond-code building practices and green power purchase/generation; and actively
promoting adoption of combined heat and power in the state. The GCGW has also identified
significant opportunities to reduce GHG emissions through policies addressing electricity
production, such as tapping into the state’s biomass potential (detailed in Chapter 5).

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The GCGW recommends, with varying levels of support, a set of 13 policies for the RCI sectors
that offer significant, cost-effective GHG emissions reductions within the state. These
recommendations and results are summarized in Table 4.1. The GHG emission reductions and
costs per ton of GHG reductions for 11 of these policies were quantified. The quantified policy
recommendations could lead to emission savings from reference case projections of:
!

9.2 MMtCO2e per year by 2025, and a cumulative savings of 70 MMtCO2e from 2009 to
2025, and

!

Net cost savings of over $1.3 billion through 2025 on a net present value basis. 2 The
weighted-average costs of these policies are a net savings of nearly $19/MMtCO2e.

Because most energy use occurs in buildings, the recommended policies center on improving
energy efficiency in buildings. There is overlap among the policies as to the types of activities
and equipment they cover, but the text following Table 4-1 provides general guidance on how
the policies complement each other. RCI-5 increases the human capital component of energy
efficiency by providing education and training for energy users across the state. RCI-2b is the
most general recommended policy that deploys electric energy efficiency across all types of
energy use: space conditioning, windows, appliances, and water heating and other end uses and
technologies. Efficiency improvements occur through improvements in building shells (RCI-1,
RCI-3, RCI-4) and weatherization (RCI-6), or enhancing the efficiency of energy-consuming
equipment within the buildings (RCI-2b, RCI-10). RCI-9 is unique because it targets both
building- and transportation-related emissions. It decreases total GHG emissions by reducing
sprawl, encouraging high-performance buildings, and promoting alternative work schedules,
such as telecommuting and 4-day work weeks for government employees.

The net cost savings, shown in constant 2005 dollars, are based on fuel expenditures; operations, maintenance, and
administrative costs; and amortized, incremental equipment costs. All net present value analyses here use a 5% real
discount rate.

The policy recommendations also differ among the customer classes they target. RCI-3 requires
government to lead the rest of the state by example by requiring that new construction and
retrofits of existing building stock meet high-performance building requirements. RCI-6 targets
low-income residential customers who tend to use energy inefficiently, but are typically hard to
reach for utility energy efficiency programs. This policy recommendation also provides
incentives for the purchase of new energy-efficient ENERGY STAR-manufactured homes through
2025.
Several of the policy recommendations address the characteristics of “upstream” generation that
supplies electricity to the RCI sectors. RCI-8 pursues opportunities to capture waste heat from
commercial and industrial processes to generate electricity using combined heat and power
projects. RCI-7 incentivizes residential consumers to switch to renewable sources of power, such
as hydropower and biomass for their electricity needs.
The policy recommendations developed by the GCGW were designed to minimize overlap
between policy recommendations. Government high-performance building standards (RCI-3a
and RCI-3b) have little overlap with utility efficiency programs. The private-sector building
standards policy recommendations (RCI-4a and RCI-4b) go above and beyond what is required
under the building code policy recommendation (RCI-1). The energy efficiency equipment
deployed under RCI-10 is additional to utility-funded programs (RCI-2b), as it us being funded
by a state tax holiday for certain equipment.
There is overlap in the expected emission reductions and costs among some of the policies
within the RCI sectors, as well as between policies in the RCI and energy supply (ES) sectors.
RCI-6 provides additional energy efficiency funding and implementation mechanisms for lowincome residential customers. Well-designed utility and non-utility energy efficiency/demandside management programs will target these populations, but not at the level identified under this
policy recommendation so RCI-6 is assumed to overlap with RCI-2b.
There are two primary interactions between the RCI and ES sector policies, both concerning the
clean energy portfolio components in policy recommendation ES-3a (Renewable Portfolio
Standard). Most of the RCI policies (especially RCI-2b) decrease overall electricity demand. As
the renewable energy portfolio requirements are based on meeting a percentage of load with
specific renewable energy or nuclear resources, the costs of ES-3a would be reduced by reducing
energy demand through these RCI policies. Finally, an additional feedback is that certain ES
policies (including ES-3a) will have the effect of reducing the GHG emissions associated with
energy production, so that RCI policies that target electricity use will have a reduced impact on
overall emissions. However, this impact is small and has not been reflected in the analysis.
The policy recommendations for the RCI sectors are affected by both state and federal policies
that incentivize or mandate more efficient use of energy. The federal Energy Independence and
Security Act (EISA) of 2007 was signed into law in December 2007. This law contains several
requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they are implemented over the next few years.
During the GCGW process, sufficient information was identified (e.g., implementation
schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with implementing energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting in Arkansas under Title III of the EISA.

4-6

The net effect of these reductions was estimated at 1,900 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity
and 1,200 billion British thermal units (BBtu) of natural gas savings in Arkansas by 2025. The
associated GHG reductions for these savings are project to be 0.9 MMtCO2e for the year 2025
using the RCI TWG CO2 methodology. Note, however, that GHG emission reductions associated
with the Title IV (Energy Savings in Buildings and Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in
Government and Public Institutions) requirements of the federal Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 have not been quantified because of the uncertainties in how they will be
implemented. It is expected that the Title IV and Title V requirements will overlap with some of
the RCI policy recommendations, especially RCI-2b, RCI-3a, RCI-3b, RCI-4a, and RCI-4b.
Arkansas has also started energy efficiency programs to reduction energy consumption within
the state. The Arkansas Public Service Commission has authorized quick-start programs of
approximately $18,530,924 for the initial 2-year period ending December 31, 2009. Municipal
and cooperative electric utilities are also currently pursuing energy efficiency programs. These
actions are expected to reduce Arkansas GHG emissions by 0.20 MMtCO2e in 2009 using the
RCI TWG CO2 methodology. The Annex to the RCI Appendix details the assumptions and
approach used to estimate reductions from existing actions in Arkansas and from EISA (2007).
Figure 4-3 shows the cumulative emission reductions from the eight policy recommendations
that have been quantified for the entire planning period for 2009–2025. There is a great deal of
variation in the emissions reductions from the policy recommendations. Public-sector operations
in the state (including schools and local government buildings) are significant GHG emitters.
Together, the aggressive government building policy recommendations (RCI-3a and RCI-3b)
contribute about 12% of total GHG reductions. Combined, the private-sector high-performance
building recommendations (RCI-4a and RCI-4b) provide only about 12.5% of the total
reductions, because of assumptions about the new building construction rate and the rate of
“down to the studs” building retrofits. RCI-2b will also contribute to building-related GHG
reductions, as minor retrofits and equipment upgrades deploy energy-efficient equipment under
this policy recommendation. The two energy supply policy recommendations (RCI-7 and RCI-8)
contribute almost 20% of the total GHG reductions.

* These are the reductions from the policy recommendations, net of overlaps between recommendations.

The policy recommendations described briefly below, and in more detail in Appendix G, not
only result in significant emission reductions and costs savings, but offer a host of additional
benefits as well. These benefits include savings to consumers and businesses on energy bills,
which can have macroeconomic benefits; reduction in spending on energy by low-income
households; reduced peak demand, electricity system capital and operating costs, risk of power
shortages, energy price increases, and price volatility; improved public health as a result of
reduced pollutant and particulate emissions by power plants; reduced dependence on imported
fuel sources; and green collar employment expansion and economic development.
For the RCI policies recommended by the GCGW to yield the levels of savings described here,
they must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner. This means, for
example, not only putting the policies themselves in place, but also attending to the development
of “supporting policies” that are needed to help make the recommended policies effective. While
the adoption of the recommended policies can result in considerable benefits to Arkansas’
environment and consumers, careful, comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation,
as well as consistent support, of these policies will be required if these benefits are to be
achieved.

Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sectors
Policy Descriptions

RCI-1

Improved Building Codes

By a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends that Arkansas take action to improve the
state’s building codes. Building energy codes specify minimum energy efficiency requirements
for new buildings or for existing buildings undergoing a major renovation. Almost half of all
U.S. GHG emissions annually are associated with the operation of RCI buildings, along with the
embodied energy of building materials.3 Given the long lifetime of most buildings, improving
the energy efficiency of buildings in the state—for example, by strengthening building energy
codes—will have a considerable immediate and ongoing impact on reducing building-sector
GHG emissions. Although Arkansas law currently requires statewide use of relatively up-to-date
building codes as defined by the International Energy Conservation Code, updates to the codes
need to be made regularly, and code enforcement in the state needs to be strengthened. Also, the
state can improve codes that are not limited to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC)
systems, including daylighting design to reduce lighting needs, electric lighting design, building
envelope design, and integrated building design strategies.
The GCGW recommends that the state take the following actions to improve building codes:
expand statewide adoption and enforcement of existing building codes, follow national codes
without amendments in Arkansas, and update Arkansas codes in concert with the timing of the
national codes. Also, the GCGW targets include a 10% improvement in energy efficiency
through educational programs for builders, building inspectors, and other building industry
professionals to ensure that the existing codes are implemented and enforced.
RCI-2a

Utility and Non-Utility DSM for Peak-Use Electricity

By a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends that Arkansas take action to reduce GHG
emissions from peak-use electricity. Peak-use electricity serves consumers when demand is
highest during the daytime on weekdays and weekends. Demand-side management (DSM)
programs can mitigate the need to install new peak-use generation resources by reducing the
amount of electricity sold during peak periods, and in turn reducing GHG emissions. These
reductions can be achieved in two ways: (1) install energy-efficient equipment, such as highefficiency air conditioners, lighting, and chillers (types of equipment deployed under RCI-2b);
and (2) reduce GHG emissions by reducing absolute levels of energy use by consumers due to
higher prices.
This policy recommendation deploys equipment, such as real-time pricing and smart metering,
that gives consumers information about their energy use and enables them to better rationalize

their use. These schemes reflect rational pricing that results in price increases during peak
periods. leading consumer to make energy-saving choices. For example, instead of using an
electric clothes dryer, higher prices give customers rewards for using line drying or other lowenergy-consuming practices.
The goal of this policy is for Arkansas to implement energy efficiency programs and DSM to
reduce growth in electricity peak demand by 5% per year by 2010 and by 10% per year by 2015.
These activities are expected to be additional to load curtailment programs that already exist or
are being planned by utilities throughout the state.
RCI-2b

Utility and Non-Utility DSM and Energy Efficiency for Electricity

With a majority vote, the GCGW recommends that Arkansas increase the efficiency of electricity
use in the state through a goal of meeting all new electric load growth in Arkansas through
energy efficiency and DSM. This policy involves implementing new or expanding existing
electric utility energy efficiency programs for all sectors, including the RCI and agricultural
sectors. To encourage the utilities to offer and promote these programs, the APSC should adopt
rate designs and cost recovery mechanisms that are necessary and in the public interest, to
decouple the recovery of the utilities' revenues from the amount of electricity or natural gas sold.
Further, the APSC should identify appropriate incentives that are necessary and in the public
interest, to further encourage the utilities to offer energy efficiency, conservation, and DSM
programs.
The efficiency with which electricity is used today can be improved in countless applications
across all sectors and throughout the state. These efficiency improvements can lead to increased
productivity for a fixed amount of electricity input, or can produce the same results using less
electricity. Arkansas’ efforts to date offer substantial room for improvement. As a result, the
state has low-cost opportunities compared to states with well-established energy efficiency
programs. National studies suggest that Arkansas has substantial potential to improve the
efficiency of its energy use. To investigate the potential for energy efficiency specifically for
Arkansas, this policy recommends undertaking a comprehensive study of supplies in the state.
The goal of this policy is for Arkansas to implement energy efficiency programs and DSM to
eliminate electric utility demand growth over a realistic phase-in period. Statewide electricity
demand growth is projected to be 1.4% through 2030. Therefore, energy efficiency and DSM
programs that deliver demand reductions of 1.4% of total sales (based on a prior 3-year running
average) would be phased in through 2015. Interim targets are to be linear reductions of
projected load growth: 16% of new load growth will be met with efficiency and DSM in 2010,
32% in 2011, 48% in 2012, 64% in 2013, 80% in 2014, and 100% in 2015. Thereafter, energy
efficiency and DSM programs delivering demand reductions equal to 1.4% of total electricity
sales would be continued, unless a comprehensive assessment of potential efficiency gains in
Arkansas and best practices nationwide indicates that greater gains are possible.

Reduced Energy Use in New and Retrofitted State-Owned Buildings: Government
“Lead by Example"

With a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends government “lead by example” initiatives
and requirements that both help state and local governments achieve substantial energy cost
savings and promote the adoption of clean energy technologies for significant GHG emission
reductions in new state and local government buildings. The policy would apply to state
government agencies, local governments, schools, and universities.
This policy recommendation sets energy efficiency goals for new construction and major
renovations, and provides energy efficiency targets that are much higher than code standards. It
achieves GHG reductions by setting a goal to reduce fossil fuel consumption by state and local
facilities, which are then certified by a third party for compliance. Other elements include
developing life-cycle GHG accounting protocols and a minimum of ENERGY STAR-rated
appliances for all government procurement. The policy recommends allowing state agencies to
retain funds saved by improving energy efficiency for funding additional energy efficiency
investments.
The goals of this policy require that by 2009 all new state buildings (buildings that utilize a
minimum of 20% of state funds), developments, and major renovations be designed to meet a
fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% less energy use
than the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 energy standard. This standard is increased to a 60% reduction in
2012, 70% in 2017, 80% in 2020, and 90% in 2025, with the goal of the buildings becoming
carbon-neutral in 2030 (using no GHG-emitting energy to operate). The higher-level GHG
reduction targets may be met through the purchase of renewable energy by governments. The
policy also requires that all new or retrofitted buildings meet stringent green building third-party
verification requirements.
RCI-3b

Reduced Energy Use in Existing State-Owned Buildings: Government “Lead by
Example"

With a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends government “lead by example” initiatives
to help state and local governments achieve substantial energy cost savings, while promoting the
adoption of clean energy technologies for significant GHG emission reductions in existing state
and local government buildings. The proposed policy provides energy efficiency targets for
existing buildings that are much higher than code standards.
The Arkansas state government is a significant consumer of energy. The state owns or leases
approximately 29.45 million square feet of building space, and pre-K through 12 schools account
for an additional 85 million square feet. Additional local government buildings, such as
courthouses, city halls, and other facilities, are not included in this inventory. Arkansas’ public
school buildings are in need of approximately $1.6 trillion of repairs and improvements that

4-11

“Impact Functioning of School, i.e., Mechanical, Electrical, HVAC.” These needs are
opportunities for installing more energy-efficient equipment. 4
The goal of this policy requires a 30% reduction in electricity consumed by existing state and
local facilities, schools, and universities by 2020. The program gets implemented so that in 2009
20% of government facilities receive the energy efficiency investments, rising to 40% of square
footage in 2014, 60% in 2016, and 80% in 2018. By 2020, the entire state existing building stock
will have received efficiency investments to reach the 30% improvement target. The policy also
requires that a third-party-verified green building certification system for commercial buildings
be used for compliance. Also included is a program to audit state activities and facilities, with a
goal of at least 20% of all buildings being audited annually, and a requirement for state and local
governments to submit annual energy plans to the state. Additionally the recommendation
includes a statewide goal that by 2025, a minimum of 15% of energy consumed by state and
local government buildings will come from renewable in-state energy sources.
RCI-4a

Promotion and Incentives for Improved New Building Design and Construction

With a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends this policy, which provides incentives and
targets to induce the owners and developers of new buildings to improve the efficiency of those
buildings' use of energy and other resources. It also contains provisions for raising targets
periodically and providing resources to building industry professionals to help achieve the
desired building performance.
This policy includes elements to encourage both the improvement and review of energy use
goals over time, and flexibility in contracting arrangements to facilitate integrated energy- and
resource-efficient design, construction, and renovation. Incentives could include low-cost loans
for investments in energy efficiency, tax credits, and feebates.
The goal of this policy is beginning in 2011 to voluntarily increase new building performance by
using tiered incentives for energy efficiency in new residential and commercial buildings that
achieve at least a 20% reduction in energy use relative to existing codes. The incentives are
scaled so that higher-efficiency buildings receive higher incentives. The minimum efficiency
improvement that is eligible for the incentive increases to 25% in 2016, 30% in 2018, and 35%
in 2020. Performance is measured through a stringent, third-party-verified green building
certification system reduces the requirement for significant oversight and enforcement by state
organizations.

Promotion and Incentives for Improved Existing Building Design and Construction

With a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends this policy, which provides incentives and
targets to induce the owners and developers of existing buildings to improve the efficiency of
those buildings' use of energy and other resources. It also contains provisions for raising targets
periodically and providing resources to building industry professionals to help achieve the
desired building performance. Existing buildings can exhibit poor energy use indicators because
of degraded equipment performance, nonintegrated design, or outdated (not the best available)
equipment.
This policy recommendation includes elements to encourage both the improvement and review
of energy use goals over time, and flexibility in contracting arrangements so as to facilitate
integrated energy- and resource-efficient design, construction, and renovation. Incentives could
include low-cost loans for investments in energy efficiency, tax credits, and feebates.
The goal of this policy is beginning in 2011 to voluntarily increase building performance by
using tiered incentives for energy efficiency in new residential and commercial buildings that
achieve at least a 15% reduction in energy use relative to regional average use for comparable
buildings. The incentives are scaled so that higher-efficiency buildings receive higher incentives.
The minimum efficiency improvement that is eligible for the incentive increases to 20% in 2014,
25% in 2016, 30% in 2018, and 35% in 2020. Performance is measured through a stringent,
third-party-verified green building certification system, which reduces the requirement for
significant oversight and enforcement by state organizations.
RCI-5

Education for Consumers, Industry Trades, and Professions

With a unanimous vote, the GCGW recommends a broad climate change and GHG reduction
education program. The ultimate effectiveness of emission reduction activities in many cases
depends on providing information and education to consumers regarding the energy and GHG
emission implications of their choices. Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a broad
awareness of climate change issues and effects (including co-benefits, such as clean air and
public health) among the state’s citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in
actions to reduce GHG emissions in their personal and professional lives.
This policy has two goals. The first is by 2010 to implement consumer awareness education on
energy consumption and how consumers can reduce GHG emissions. Consumers typically
consider energy issues “below the radar” when energy costs are a small part of disposable
income and are not the subject of extensive media coverage. The education program can link
energy consumption to the costs of climate change and the benefits from GHG reductions, such
as green collar jobs and reduced energy expenditures for their household.
The second goal of this recommendation is technical education for builders and contractors on
the specific methods they can incorporate to reduce GHG emissions at every stage of
construction beginning in 2010. This policy recommendation also addresses education and
outreach programs for building professionals to encourage incorporation of energy efficiency
and GHG emission reduction considerations, such as programs to train builders and contractors.

4-13

Education and training should also be made available to builders and contractors and others for
retrofitting existing buildings.
RCI-6

Incentives and Funds To Promote Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency

By a super majority vote, the GCGW recommends RCI-6 to improve the energy efficiency of
target markets. At least 33% of Arkansans have an income of less than $30,000/year, of which
they spend 20%–30% on utility bills. There are currently not enough weatherization or energy
conservation programs in place to reduce the economic burden on this population or to have a
scalable impact on mitigating the GHG emissions produced by these homes. Providing
traditional financing options for low-income homeowners will not meet their needs or achieve
any meaningful scale. The need exists for identifying these homeowners; educating them about
the benefits of, and the opportunity for having, energy audits; and financing the implementation
of energy-efficient measures.
In addition, manufactured (mobile) homes account for approximately 27% of residential
structures in Arkansas. Yet, mobile homes are exempt from compliance with the Arkansas
Energy Code and fall under U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development regulation.
These homes are factory-made and can more easily implement efficiency improvements.
The goal of this program is to increase the energy efficiency in low-income and manufactured
residences. The low-income retrofit portion of this policy targets the weatherization of 10,000
homes annually by 2015 with energy efficiency improvements of 33% per upgraded residence.
The long-term goal is retrofitting 90% of the total low-income homeowner population. This
program also expands available funding per residence from the current level (approximately
$2,800) to be able to upgrade major appliances, such as furnaces.
For the manufactured housing portion of this policy, the goal is to provide incentives for the
purchase of new ENERGY STAR-manufactured homes, so that by 2025, 75% of all new
manufactured homes purchased are ENERGY STAR-certified.
RCI-7

Green Power Purchasing for Consumers

By unanimous vote the GCGW recommends this policy to promote the use of renewable
electricity for Arkansas’ residential customers. Arkansas is endowed with renewable resources
that can be used for electricity generation or substituted for direct fossil fuel use. This
recommendation leverages this potential through programs and policies that encourage
consumers to switch from using fossil fuels to purchasing renewable electricity for their energy
use.
Green power purchasing refers to a variety of consumer-driven strategies to increase the
production and delivery of low-GHG power sources beyond levels achieved through renewable
portfolio standard and other mandatory programs. These sources include solar, wind, geothermal,
biogas, biomass, and low-impact hydroelectric energy. Green power purchasing programs
provide consumers with information about alternative green sources of energy they can select,
rather than the traditional, more carbon-intensive sources.

4-14

The goal of this policy is that by 2025, this voluntary program incentivizes one of four
residential customers to participate in green power purchasing programs. Those who participate
in the program will purchase up to 25% of their total electricity use from renewable resources.
The program will require a mechanism that strongly encourages utilities purchasing power to
develop green power in Arkansas.
RCI-8

Nonresidential Energy Efficiency

Combined heat and power (CHP) refers to any system that simultaneously or sequentially
generates electric energy and utilizes the thermal energy that is normally wasted, significantly
increasing efficiency over separate generation of electricity and thermal energy. Many CHP
systems are capable of an overall efficiency of over 80%—double that of conventional systems.
Another significant advantage is the reduced transmission and distribution losses associated with
centralized power generation.
Existing data suggest the existence of a very large unrealized potential for CHP in Arkansas.
However, energy recycling, including CHP, is challenged by several noneconomic factors, such
as regulatory and environmental permitting complexity or uncertainty, utility resistance to CHP
because of potential loss of expected revenue, and increased complexity of facility design and
operations. Additional installations of new CHP systems by residential, commercial,
institutional, and industrial energy consumers, and continued operation or expansion of existing
systems, could be encouraged through a combination of regulatory changes (starting with a
review of state and regional policies on permitting, net metering, standby rates, interconnection,
and other issues affecting CHP); education and information transfer; and incentive programs.
The GCGW unanimously recommends increased effort toward tapping into the unrealized
potential for CHP and waste heat recovery in Arkansas. The goal is to install additional CHP and
waste heat recovery technical potential on 25% of new boiler installations of a minimum size
rating consistent with a reasonable payout in the state.
This GCGW also recommends that Arkansas consider adopting incentives to encourage highefficiency electrical transformers that can efficiently handle nonlinear (variable) loads from
digital equipment and lighting.
RCI-9

Support for Energy-Efficient Communities, Including Smart Growth

By unanimous vote, the GCGW adopted this policy recommendation to promote smart growth.
Smart growth dictates how the state will invest its money in community development, either by
regulating local land-use decisions or by providing incentives to influence those decisions.
Existing building, zoning codes, and business schedules often work against smart growth
development. In the context of GHG emissions, smart growth policies can serve to revitalize and
reuse commercial sites and will help preserve critical natural resources and farmland.

4-15

The goals of this program are multifaceted:
!

By 2009, provide resources for local jurisdictions to examine and rewrite their outdated state
and local codes to accommodate for smart growth initiatives in community planning and
development. Implementing smart growth policies is expected to reduce (per-unit) energy
consumption, GHG emissions, infrastructure costs, and new construction by 30% by 2030.
Design all new buildings, developments, and major renovations to meet the targets in RCI-4a
and RCI-4b.

!

Create incentives to encourage smart growth by meeting Built Green Community
certification or the LEED-ND (LEED for Neighborhood Development) gold level, with
minimum energy and location criteria.

!

Encourage compact and transit-oriented, mixed-use development within urban growth areas
that results in reduced vehicle miles traveled and GHG emissions and encourages walking
and biking.

!

Encourage state and local governments and private firms to adopt telework policies to reduce
building and transportation-related GHG emissions.

!

Commission a study on the effects of alternative work schedules similar to West Virginia
House Resolution #34 and others.

!

Limit sprawl by enabling transfer of development rights, revitalizing communities through
developed land and building reuse incentives, and institute a variety of conservation
measures for woodlands and wetlands.

!

Support locally owned shops, restaurants, and farmers' markets to help local businesses and
family farms remain profitable, thus strengthening the local economy and protecting rural
legacy and lands.

RCI-10

Energy-Savings Sales Tax

By a super majority vote, this policy recommendation refers to a sales tax exemption for energyefficient products, such as compact fluorescent lights, geothermal heat pumps, highly efficient
heat pump systems, and ENERGY STAR-certified water heaters, refrigerators and freezers, clothes
washers and dryers, and dishwashers. Establishing a market signal that rewards lower-carbon
purchase decision making provides consumers an incentive to improve their energy efficiency
and reduce their adverse impacts on climate.
The list of energy efficiency measures that this policy recommendation applies to contains the
same measures that utility energy efficiency programs typically pursue. Utility programs assume
that some portion (usually ~25%) of the capital costs of the efficiency measure is paid for by the
participant. Thus, this policy recommendation reduces the purchase price (capital cost) of
energy-efficient goods by consumers by the amount of the sales tax. However, these costs are
then paid for by the state, rather than consumers.
The goal of this policy is to implement a state sales tax exemption for all consumers on energyefficient equipment. The program is to be implemented by 2010 and requires point-of-sale tax
exemption at retailers for the tax policy to be implemented.
4-16

Chapter 5
Energy Supply
Overview of GHG Emissions
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from Arkansas’s energy supply (ES) sector include emissions
from electricity generation and represent a substantial portion of the state’s overall GHG
emissions (approximately 32% of gross emissions on a consumption basis in 2005). From 1990
to 1999 and from 2001 to 2004, Arkansas was a net exporter of electricity, meaning that
Arkansas power plants have produced more electricity than is consumed in the state.1 For 2000
and 2005, Arkansas was a net importer of electricity. Based on the approval of the Arkansas
Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW), the final reference case forecast assumes
that Arkansas is self-sufficient in electricity production, and that there will be no net imports
over the revised forecast period (2006–2025). For the purpose of estimating emissions, natural
gas-fired generation is assumed to fill any gaps in the supply of electricity to meet Arkansas
demand during the forecast period.
In the absence of any mitigation efforts, GHG emissions from Arkansas’s ES sector are expected
to increase from 2005 base year levels of 27.2 million metric tons (MMt) of carbon dioxide
equivalent (CO2e) to about 37.4 MMtCO2e by 2025, or by approximately 37.2% over this 20year period. The reference case forecast includes the following two coal plants: Plum Point to be
brought on-line in 2010 and the Turk plant in Hempstead County to be brought on-line in 2012.
The reference case projections reflect the planning assumption that sufficient high-efficiency
natural gas-fired capacity is built within the state to satisfy future retail electricity demand
growth in Arkansas. This trend is summarized in Figure 5-1. It is important to emphasize that
these GHG reduction trends are evident prior to the implementation of any of the ES mitigation
measures recommended by the GCGW.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The key challenge in addressing GHG emissions from Arkansas’s ES sector is the state’s
continued reliance on coal-fired generation inside the state. The share of GHG emissions from
coal-fired generation was about 85% in 2005, and is projected to reach 92% in 2012 when both
the new Plum Point and Hempstead plants are on line, and drop only slightly—to 82% in 2025—
associated with the addition of high-efficiency natural gas generation.
Like many other states, the projected large growth in electricity sales is the primary driver for
Arkansas’ GHG emissions. The projected average annual growth rate of electricity sales in
Arkansas between 2005 and 2025 is rather substantial—about 1.37% per year. This rate
incorporates any current demand-side management programs in the state.

1

Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in state and out of state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimates reflect some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A of the Inventory and Projections report.

Arkansas has several opportunities for reducing the growth in GHG emissions attributable to
energy production and supply. For example, the carbon intensity of in-state electricity generation
could be decreased through the introduction of new renewable resources, such as wind and
biomass, the addition of carbon capture and storage technologies for existing (through retrofits)
coal-fired stations in the state once such technology is commercially available, and the
penetration of combined heat and power systems. Significant opportunities to reduce GHG
emissions through options to further reduce electricity consumption also exist, and can often
provide net cost savings to Arkansas consumers and the state. Several demand-side management,
energy efficiency, and conservation measures recommended in the residential, commercial, and
industrial sector are detailed in Chapter 4 of this report.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The GCGW analyzed and is recommending several policies for the ES sector that offer the
potential for significant GHG emission reductions, as summarized in Table 5-1. All policy
recommendation totals are relative to the underlying assumption that electricity expansion in
Arkansas will proceed with the installation of the Plum Point pulverized coal station in 2010 and
the installation of the Hempstead pulverized coal plant in 2012. In making this assumption, the
GCGW is not recommending for or against the need for or merits of the addition of the
Hempstead plant.

These recommendations include efforts to support technology research and development (R&D)
activities (ES-2), encourage the penetration of renewable energy (ES-3), provide incentives for
renewable energy (ES-4), encourage regional approaches to GHG reductions (ES-5), promote
combined heart and power (CHP) systems (ES-6), sequester GHG emissions from coal-fired
stations (ES-7), encourage support for transmission and distribution (T&D) upgrades (ES-8),
promote nuclear power (ES-9), support a carbon tax (ES-10), and promote efficiency
improvements at existing power plants. These policy recommendations contribute to GHG
emission reductions during 2009–2025, as outlined in Table 5-1.
Overall, the ES mitigation recommendations yield annual GHG emission reductions from
reference case projections of about 22.6 MMtCO2e in 2025 and cumulative reductions of
179.5 MMtCO2e from 2009 through 2025, at a net cost of approximately $6.228 billion through
2025 on a net present value basis. The weighted-average cost of saved carbon for the ES
measures is about $35/tCO2e avoided. An overview of each policy recommendation is provided
in this chapter. Additional details regarding the application of these recommendations to
Arkansas (targets, implementation mechanisms, parties involved, modeling approach, etc.) are
provided in Appendix H.

Energy Supply Sector Policy Descriptions

The ES sector has several opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions from electricity
generation, including mitigation activities associated with the generation, transmission, and
distribution of electricity—whether generated through the combustion of fossil fuels, renewable
energy sources in a centralized power station supplying the grid, distributed generation facilities,
or imported into the state.
ES-2.

Technology Research & Development

This recommendation involves support for R&D that targets a particular GHG-mitigating
technology as part of a state initiative to build an industry around that technology in the state,
and sets the stage for future adoption of the technology for use in the state. This recommendation
also includes funding for demonstration projects to help commercialize technologies that have
already been developed, but are not yet in widespread use. Finally, funding is also intended to
support increased collaboration among existing institutions in the state for R&D.
ES-3a.

Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)

A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is a requirement that utilities must supply a certain,
generally fixed, percentage of electricity from an eligible renewable energy source(s). An
environmental portfolio standard expands that notion to include energy efficiency or other GHG
emission-reducing technologies as an eligible resource. About 20 states currently have an RPS in
place. In some cases, utilities can also meet their portfolio requirements by purchasing
Renewable Energy Certificates from eligible renewable energy projects. The application of an
RPS in Arkansas is provisional. That is the primary recommendation for achieving greater
penetration of renewable energy in the recommendation described in ES-3b (Renewable Energy
Feed-In Tariff [REFIT]). However, if certain goals of the REFIT recommendation are not
achieved, the RPS would go into effect. If regional and national bulk electric transmission lines
(the equivalent of the interstate highway system) are not built, access to significant and costeffective renewable generation will be obstructed, and goals for such must be scaled back to
levels reliably and economically achievable.
ES-3b.

Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT)

A Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) provides guaranteed above-market rates for a given
period to entities that install qualifying sources of renewable energy and sell energy back to the
grid. The higher rate helps overcome the cost disadvantages of renewable energy sources and
may be set at different levels for the various forms of renewable power generation. Utilities
would be able to recover the cost of the program, plus a reasonable profit, from their ratepayer
base. In cases where the entity does not have the capital available to finance the renewable

5-5

energy installation, it can display this utility guarantee to a financial institution to aid in
obtaining a loan for the purchase price of the installation.
ES-4.

Grid-Based Renewable Energy Incentives and/or Barrier Removal

This policy recommendation involves tax incentives and innovative financing programs for
residential and commercial utility users who develop or apply successful renewable energy
systems. The tax and loan incentives would be proportional to the amount of renewable energy
they are using, with the greatest incentives for those who use net metering and return energy to
the grid for use by other utility customers. Legislative Council, the Arkansas Department of
Finance and Revenue, the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, the Arkansas Department
of Environmental Quality, and the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority, in coordination
with the GCGW and the appropriate legislative leaders, should research model programs in other
states and countries and make recommendations on specific policies in time for the next
legislative session. In addition, pilot and demonstration programs should be established to
demonstrate the effectiveness of these policies as they are implemented. Alternative sources of
funding, including foundations, utility companies, and others, should be sought to supplement
state revenue for these policies.
ES-5.

Approaches Benefiting From Regional Application

The primary goal of this policy recommendation is to establish a program that will allow
Arkansas to adapt to and be prepared for a federally implemented cap-and-trade system. A capand-trade system is a market mechanism by which GHG emissions are limited or capped at a
specified level, and those participating in the system are required to hold permits for each unit of
emissions. Through trading, participants with lower costs of compliance can choose to
overcomply and sell their additional reductions to participants for whom compliance costs are
higher. In this fashion, the overall costs of compliance are lower than they would otherwise be.
ES-6.

Combined Heat and Power

CHP refers to any system that simultaneously or sequentially generates electric energy and
utilizes the thermal energy that is normally wasted. The recovered thermal energy can be used
for industrial process steam, space heating, hot water, air conditioning, water cooling, product
drying, or nearly any other thermal energy need in the commercial and industrial sectors. The
end result is significantly increased efficiency over generating electric and thermal energy
separately. In fact, many CHP systems are capable of an overall efficiency of over 80%—double
that of conventional systems. Another significant advantage is the reduced T&D losses
associated with centralized power generation.
ES-7.

Geological Underground Sequestration for New Plants

This policy recommendation refers to the capture of CO2 from fossil fuel-fired power plant
emissions and its sequestration in geologic formations, including oil and gas reservoirs,

5-6

unminable coal seams, and deep saline reservoirs. Broadly, three different types of technologies
exist: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion. After capture, the CO2 must be
transported to suitable storage sites, which this is often accomplished via pipeline.
This policy affects all new coal-fired power plants, both those that are currently under
construction and those that have not yet received full approval for construction in Arkansas.
Plants currently under construction (including the Plum Point plant) should install and employ
post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) as soon after the plant's opening as the
technology becomes available. Plants that have not yet received full approval for construction
(including the Hempstead plant) should employ CCS as soon as they begin operations. All other
new coal-fired generating plants should employ state-of-the-art pre-combustion CCS as soon as
they begin operations.
This policy implies that, except for the already-permitted Plum Point plant, there will be no new
coal-fired generating plants in Arkansas until sequestration is ready. Until that time, the
electricity that would have been generated by new plants should be replaced with expanded
energy efficiency, renewable energy, and, as a last resort, natural gas combined-cycle
technology.
ES-8.

Transmission System Upgrades

This recommendation involves measures to improve transmission systems to reduce bottlenecks
and enhance throughput while satisfying long-term electricity demands, improving the efficiency
of operations, and allowing for delivery of diverse and renewable energy sources located outside
of the state. Opportunities exist to substantially increase transmission line carrying capacity
through the implementation of new construction and retrofit activities on the transmission grid,
including incorporating advanced composite conductor technologies, capacitance technologies,
and grid management software. This recommendation is important, as siting new transmission
lines can be a difficult process, given their cost and their local impact on the environment and on
the use, enjoyment, and value of property.
ES-9.

Nuclear Power

Nuclear power has historically been a low-GHG source of electric power. However, no new
nuclear power plants have come on line in the United States since 1996 due to high capital costs.
Long-term disposal of nuclear waste and public safety are public policy concerns with nuclear
power. With the national pricing of the GHG cost of fossil fuel generation, with either a cap-andtrade system or a carbon tax, nuclear power may be more cost-competitive.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions encouraging the construction of new nuclear
units. There are currently nine applications for a new plant on file with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). The one nearest to Arkansas is adjacent to the existing Grand Gulf unit in
Port Gibson, Mississippi; it has been accepted for docketing by the NRC. As new nuclear power
plants come on line in the future in the Arkansas region, they will offer Arkansas electric utilities
an alternative to the construction of fossil fuel generation units.

5-7

ES-10.

Carbon Tax

The primary goal of this policy recommendation is to establish a mechanism that will allow
Arkansas to adapt to and be prepared for a federally implemented carbon tax and other federal
climate policies. A carbon tax sets a fee, or tax, for the release of carbon to the atmosphere. It
does not set a limit, reduce, or otherwise control the tons of carbon released. The tax raises the
cost of carbon-based emissions and, therefore, encourages investment in low-carbon or nocarbon alternatives. It also generates revenue for the government, which could be directed
toward energy efficiency, the development and use of renewable energy, climate change
adaptation investments, and other measures to mitigate or address the impacts of climate change.
Many proposals also have options to rebate the tax back to the ratepayer, particularly lowincome ratepayers. A carbon tax could be implemented as a tax on fossil fuels according to the
amount of CO2 emitted by their combustion. One of the benefits is that the tax can be more
easily applied across all sectors. To achieve the stated goal, the amount of the tax must be high
enough to trigger financial and behavioral decisions toward conservation or a shift to loweremitting fuels.
The design elements of this policy include the following:
!

Arkansas should only consider carbon tax programs that are national in scope, and in
conjunction with other carbon tax and “cap-and-trade” programs that are proposed. The state
should opt for national programs that use revenue sharing back to state government for
purposes of implementing state initiatives on global warming. The state should promote a
national carbon tax that does not put Arkansas at a competitive disadvantage with other
states.

!

Arkansas should make the cost of inefficient or higher CO2-emitting activities more
expensive than alternatives, thereby creating a financial incentive to discourage activities that
result in CO2 emissions. The amount of revenue that the carbon tax generates annually
should depend on the facilities subject to the tax. The amount of the tax should be high
enough to contribute to the reduction targets specified in a statute. From a competitive
perspective, one advantage of a carbon tax is that it is constant and predictable, making a
business case more stable than some alternatives.

A carbon tax should include options to rebate the tax back to the ratepayer, thus creating a true
cost of carbon but keeping ratepayers from paying more on their utility bills. This should
include rebates on income and payroll taxes, particularly for low-income ratepayers.
!

Voluntary carbon offset programs should be established in Arkansas through utility bills and
other mechanisms.

ES-11.

Efficiency Improvements and Repowering of Existing Plants

This recommendation involves improving efficiency at existing plants through such
improvements as more efficient boilers and turbines, improved control systems, or combinedcycle technology. This could also include switching to lower- or zero-emitting fuels at existing
plants, or new capacity additions. Policies to encourage efficiency improvements and repowering

5-8

of existing plants could include incentives and/or regulations. Although most economic
improvements have already been made, existing power plants should be encouraged to reach
specific energy efficiency goals before new plants are constructed.

Chapter 6
Transportation and Land Use Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, which includes light- and heavy-duty (on-road) vehicles, aircraft, rail
engines, and marine engines, is one of the largest contributors of gross greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in Arkansas. This sector accounted for 26% of Arkansas’s gross GHG emissions in
2005, which was slightly under the national average of 27%. However, by 2025, the share of
emissions associated with the transportation sector is anticipated to increase slightly to 27%.
From 1990 to 2005, Arkansas’ GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily at
an average rate of about 1.8% annually. The GHG emissions associated with Arkansas’
transportation sector also rose accordingly, increasing by 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMtCO2e) emissions during the same time period from about 17 MMtCO2e to 22
MMtCO2e. If left unabated, this number is expected to increase by 29%, to 31 MMtCO2e by
2025.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for about 98% of transportation GHG emissions, with most of
the remaining GHG emissions coming from nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from gasoline
engines. Emissions released from on-road gasoline consumption account for approximately 57%
of the transportation sector's GHG emissions. This has historically been the largest share of
transportation GHG emissions, and this trend is forecast to continue.
Figure 6-1 shows historic and projected transportation GHG emissions by fuel and source. As a
result of Arkansas’ population and economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles
traveled (VMT), on-road gasoline consumption increased by about 15% between 1990 and 2005
and accounted for 57% of the total transportation emissions in 2005. Meanwhile, on-road diesel
fuel consumption rose by 61% during that period, accounting for 28% of GHG emissions from
the transportation sector in 2005, suggesting an even more rapid growth in freight movement
within or across the state.
In the absence of significant increases in vehicle fuel economy, on-road gasoline and diesel
emissions are expected to continue to grow. GHG emissions from on-road gasoline consumption
are projected to increase by about 32%, and GHG emissions from on-road diesel consumption
are expected to increase by 78% between 2005 and 2025. The consumption of these fuels will
significantly contribute to the projected 41% increase in overall emission levels for the entire
state of Arkansas over 2005 levels by 2025.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Arkansas has substantial opportunities to reduce transportation emissions. The principal means to
reduce emissions from transportation and land use (TLU) are:
!

Improving vehicle fuel efficiency,

!

Substituting gasoline and diesel with lower-emission fuels, and

!

Reducing total VMT.

In Arkansas and in the nation as a whole, vehicle fuel efficiency has improved little since the late
1980s, yet many studies have documented the potential for substantial increases in efficiency,
while maintaining vehicle size and performance. Automobile manufacturers typically oppose
dramatic increases in fuel economy. Key points of contention include the cost to manufacturers
and cost to consumers. Even with the adoption of the new federal corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) requirements, there may still be opportunities for further increases in fuel
efficiency while maintaining vehicle size and performance.
The use of fuels with lower per-mile GHG emissions is growing in Arkansas, and larger market
penetration is possible. Conventional gasoline- and diesel-fired vehicles can use low-level blends
of biofuels. Alternative-technology vehicles can also use higher-level blends of biofuels, as well
as other types of alternative fuels, such as natural gas and hydrogen. The type of fuel used is a
crucial determinant of impact on emissions, as some alternative fuels have relatively little GHG
benefit. Currently, the most prevalent biofuel in Arkansas is corn-based ethanol, which has

6-2

minimal GHG benefit from a life-cycle perspective.1 Key determinants of impact will be the
development and deployment of fuel types. At present, fuel distribution infrastructure is a
constraining factor.
Reducing VMT is crucial to mitigating GHG emissions from transportation. Developing smarter
land-use and transportation development patterns that reduce trip length and support transit, ride
sharing, biking, and walking can contribute substantially to this goal. A variety of pricing polices
and incentive packages can also help to reduce VMT. Developing better planning methods and
regulations, and increasing funding of multiple modes of transportation will be key components
in achieving these goals.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW) recommends a set of 10
policies for the TLU sector that offer the potential for major economic benefits and emission
savings. Implementing these policy recommendations could lead to emission reductions of:
!

3.2 MMtCO2e per year by 2025, and

!

28.89 MMtCO2e cumulative from 2009 through 2025.

The weighted-average cost effectiveness of the recommended policies is about –$78/tCO2e,
representing a cost savings. This average value includes policies that have both much lower and
much higher likely costs per ton.
The estimated impacts of the individual policies are shown in Table 6-1. The GCGW policy
recommendations are described briefly here and in more detail in Appendix I of this report. The
recommendations not only result in significant emission reductions, but offer a host of additional
benefits as well. These benefits include reduced local air pollution; more livable, healthier
communities; and economic development and job growth from in-state biofuel production. To
yield the levels of savings described here, the recommended policies need to be implemented in a
timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
Some policies focus on reducing VMT by further developing other modes of transportation, such
as transit (TLU-5), freight rail (TLU-7), and pedestrian and bicycling infrastructure (TLU-4 and
TLU-6). These policies help to reduce GHG emissions by moving people and freight more
efficiently and providing other options for people and freight to reach their destinations.
Qualitative policies (policy recommendations that are nonquantifiable) are also an important
component of the recommended policies, but are not reflected in the GHG emission reductions
or costs. These recommendations focus on studying the feasibility of plug-in hybrid electric
vehicles (PHEVs) (TLU-1), research and development of renewable transportation fuels
(TLU-2), fuel efficiency incentives (TLU-9), public education (TLU-10), and procuring efficient
fleet vehicles for the state (TLU-8). While the implementation of these recommendations may

contribute to significant GHG emission reductions, the immediate impact of these policies
individually is not quantifiable.
Further developing biofuels and expanding the biofuels market can significantly reduce GHG
emissions, while boosting the state’s economy. TLU-3 focuses on this area, while working in
conjunction with the research and development of renewable transportation fuels afforded by
TLU-2.

Arkansas can achieve greater alternative fuel use through a combination of research and
development, as well as through implementing voluntary and mandatory measures. Research and
Development of Renewable Transportation Fuels (TLU-2) can work in conjunction with
Advanced Biofuels Development and Expansion (TLU-3) to help make biofuels more efficient
and more available, while at the same time providing an economic benefit to the Arkansas
economy by promoting in-state development and production of these fuels.
A number of polices would work together to reduce VMT by increasing the viability of other
modes of travel. These policies will require increased coordination among state and local
governments and businesses in many cases. TLU-4 (Smart Growth, Pedestrian and Bicycle
Infrastructure) promotes protecting open space, while revitalizing downtown areas focusing on
infill development, transit-oriented development, and the development of pedestrian and bicycle
infrastructure. Related to TLU-4 is TLU-5 (Improve and Expand Transit Service and
Infrastructure), which promotes both increasing transit service and developing a high-speed
intra-city passenger rail system. Such a rail system would be most efficient traveling from city
center to city center, where there is sufficient population density to support the system. The
density necessary to support this rail system could be developed through the policies set forth n
TLU-4. Similarly, TLU-6, which promotes walking, bicycling, and utilizing carpools and transit
systems to access schools, colleges, and universities, and promotes the citing of new schools in
walkable communities, works very well in cooperation with TLU-4 and TLU-5. All three of
these policies will require cooperation among planning agencies, state and local governments,
developers, and communities as a whole.
Public education, listed as a separate policy recommendation under TLU-10 (Public Education),
works in conjunction with numerous other recommended policies. Educating citizens on how
they can minimize their impact, operate their vehicle more efficiently, reduce their VMT, and cut
their GHG emissions can be a key to the success of many of these policies. Additionally public
education can help to generate the support necessary for the success of other policies, such as
smart growth communities (TLU-4), safe routes to school (TLU-6), the procurement of efficient
fleet vehicles (TLU-8), and the incentivizing of clean cars (TLU-9).
Figure 6-2 shows the breakdown of the projected impacts of the recommended TLU policies,
taken together, in terms of avoided GHG emissions. For the TLU policies recommended by the
GCGW to yield the levels of savings described here, the policies must be implemented in a
timely, aggressive, and thorough manner. This means, for example, not only putting the policies
themselves in place, but also attending to the development of supporting policies that are needed
to help make the recommended policies effective. While the adopted of the recommended
policies can result in considerable benefits to Arkansas’ environment and consumers, careful,
comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation, as well as consistent support of these
policies will be required if these benefits are to be achieved.

Policy Descriptions

The policy recommendations described briefly here not only result in significant emission
reductions and cost savings but also offer a host of additional benefits, such as reduced local air
pollution; more livable, healthier communities; and increased transportation choices.
TLU-1.

Study the Feasibility of Plug-In Vehicles

This policy recommendation will implement a study that will review relevant, completed,
ongoing, and forthcoming studies, including the 3-year national study (begun in 2007 and
expected to be completed by 2010) by the Electric Power Research Institute, Ford Motor
Company, and Southern California Edison, which will develop and evaluate technical
approaches for integrating plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the nation's electric grid
system. 2 Following the review of the relevant studies, this policy will assess the potential
effectiveness of implementing some or all of the following options: converting state and local
government fleets to PHEVs, providing funding for school districts to acquire plug-in electric
hybrid school buses, providing rate recovery for utility research and development investments in
pilot tests of vehicle-to-grid systems, assessing the need of electric vehicle charging in state
parking facilities, developing and funding at least one vehicle-to-grid pilot involving a fleet of
public plug-ins parked in a state garage, identifying Arkansas companies and economic sectors
with potential vehicle electrification markets, and developing a strategy to help Arkansas
companies position themselves for success in those markets.
TLU-2.

Research and Development of Renewable Transportation Fuels

This policy recommendation provides support and assistance for the development of low-carbon
fuels that are not yet commercially available in Arkansas, such as cellulosic ethanol. Support and
assistance will surround the funding of the research and development related to biofuel/biodiesel
production, such as investigating the production of biofuels from Arkansas-based biomass
feedstocks from agricultural production, agricultural processing, forest or wood resources or
production processes, or other cellulosic crops. This will be done in order to increase the
capacity of the state university system to develop and produce such fuels cost-effectively.
Additionally this policy will attempt to identify funding sources to conduct analyses and identify
which renewable fuels will provide the best options for Arkansas and its constituent regions and
cities.

TLU-3.

Advanced Biofuels Development and Expansion

This policy recommends that Arkansas encourage state and national industries to reach for
specific goals, as measured by specific volume amounts or percentages of advanced biofuels that
would produce fewer GHG emissions when considered on a per-volume and/or per-energy-unit
basis. The state could incentivize the development of in-state industries and businesses that
produce and distribute alternative fuels with the goal of this policy recommendation being to
increase the use of alternative fuels that emit less GHG emissions in automobile and other
gasoline-powered vehicles to the level of at least 10% of the total consumed by 2015, with
particular emphasis on biofuels.
This policy also recommends that the state encourage industry and research universities to work
together to create an Arkansas Alternative Energy Institute.
TLU-4.

Smart Growth, Pedestrian and Bicycle Infrastructure

This policy recommendation calls for incentives and programs to encourage smart growth,
including enhancing the pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. Current land-use development
practices increase vehicle travel by dispersing destinations, which separates activities and favors
automobile travel over alternative modes. "Smart growth" planning by local, regional, and state
governments refers to development that reduces sprawl and maximizes environmental, fiscal,
and economic resources. Under this policy recommendation, Arkansas would encourage,
facilitate, and undertake a set of smart growth activities related to the following initiatives:
mixed use, open-space protections, downtown revitalization, “greyfield” redevelopment, 3 infill
development, transit-oriented development, and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. This policy
recommendation seeks to preserve open, recreational, and agricultural spaces and to prevent
sprawl, especially on the periphery of urban areas where sprawling development may otherwise
occur.
TLU-5.

Improve and Expand Transit Service and Infrastructure

The goal of this policy recommendation is to reduce light-duty vehicle VMT in urban areas from
the 2008 baseline growth by 1% per year starting in 2010 until 2025. This will be achieved by
making improvements to existing transit service, such as increasing service frequency,
improving the quality of service, and reducing travel times on selected transit routes. This policy
recommendation will also include expanding transit routes to reach more people. It will shift
passenger transportation from single-occupant vehicles to public transit, thereby reducing GHG
emissions.
This policy recommends that incentives be offered to potential passengers and that loans and/or
subsidies be made to operators (public or private) to provide improved and less expensive
intercity bus service. Also, financing will be provided in addition to regulatory relief, and
eminent domain will be used to develop, either publicly or privately, a high-speed intercity

passenger rail system to serve major urban areas, or financial assistance will be made available to
improve services already provided by Amtrak on other routes.
TLU-6.

School and University Bundle

This policy recommendation focuses on encouraging the reduction of transportation GHG
emissions when transporting students to K-12 schools, colleges, and universities. This is
accomplished by utilizing the federal Safe Routes To School program, which promotes students
at the K-12 level walking and riding their bikes to school. Additionally, this policy recommends
that school districts study the most efficient bus routes to limit the VMT by school buses. At high
schools, colleges, and universities, will promote car and van pooling and policies that limit the
availability of student parking. Goals for this policy recommendation include a 5% reduction in
total VMT for transporting students to school by 2012, which increases to a goal of a 10%
reduction by 2025.
TLU-7.

Promote and Facilitate Freight Efficiency

This policy recommendation focuses on promoting and facilitating freight efficiency by
improving railroad infrastructure and rail yards, increasing rail and river shipping capacity,
providing economic assistance and regulatory streamlining for the improvement of intermodal
rail yards and the relief of freight bottlenecks, providing electrification at truck stops to reduce
idling, supporting and promoting policies and legislation that improve regulatory oversight of the
railroad industry, providing plug-in power at port sites to enable vessels to turn off engines and
reduce idling, and providing incentives for purchasing and/or upgrading to more efficient trucks.
The goals of this policy recommendation are to reduce truck idling by Class 8 (tractor-trailer)
trucks by 80% by 2010 and 100% by 2020 by reforming the state transportation board, investing
in rail infrastructure, establishing standards for truck stop electrification, assessing port facilities
and rail-switching yards, and providing incentives to trucking companies that invest in the
purchase of low-emission engines and lightweight tractor/trailer combinations.
TLU-8.

Procurement of Efficient Fleet Vehicles (Passenger and Freight)

This policy recommends that state and local government agencies “lead by example” by enacting
procurement policies and or joining the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s SmartWay
program and utilizing SmartWay Upgrade Kits that result in the adoption of lower-emitting
vehicle fleets. In leading by example, state and local governments will ensure that their vehicle
fleets meet or exceed the targets set for the state as whole, while ensuring that the means are
available for all public and private vehicles to also exceed these standards voluntarily.
TLU-9.

Fuel Efficiency: Clean Car Incentive

This policy recommendation promotes the use of a market-based incentives program to provide
rebates to Arkansans who purchase new vehicles that reduce oil consumption and have lower
GHG emissions by being more fuel efficient. This program would be self-financed, being paid
6-9

for with disincentives (fees) to those who purchase new vehicles that are less fuel-efficient. The
rebates or fees would be subtracted or added to the purchase price of the vehicle at the point of
sale. Incentives and disincentives should equal out to zero, as the point at which incentives are
provided or disincentives are included—the “pivot point”—would rise in proportion to each
vehicle’s gasoline savings or consumption. The pivot point is essentially the average mileage
standard that divides the incentives from disincentives. The goals of this policy recommendation
include increasing the sales of fuel-efficient vehicles, reducing the sales of inefficient vehicles,
and raising the average mile-per-gallon (mpg) rate within the state.
TLU-10.

Public Education

This policy recommendation focuses on better informing the public of the measures they as
individuals can take to reduce their transportation-related GHG emissions. It encourages drivers
to voluntarily reduce their fuel consumption as well as their VMT. This policy would educate the
public about transportation options and consequences, proper vehicle operation and maintenance
aimed at increased mpg reducing GHG emissions, and city planning choices. This curriculum
would be a requirement for all driver training programs and would be distributed through other
possible venues as deemed appropriate by the agency(ies) developing the program.

Chapter 7
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management
Overview of GHG Emissions
The agriculture, forestry, and waste management (AFW) sectors are directly responsible for
moderate amounts of Arkansas’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The total AFW
contribution to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) gross emissions in 2005 was 14 million metric
tons (MMt), or about 17% of the state’s total. The AFW contribution to net emissions in 2005
was –7 MMtCO2e due to the net sequestration of carbon in the forestry and agriculture sectors.
As described in the Inventory and Forecast (I&F) report, it is important to recognize that
emissions from fossil fuel consumption within the AFW sectors are included within the
residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors (particularly the industrial sector).
Agricultural emissions include methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from enteric
fermentation, manure management, agricultural soils management, rice cultivation, and
agriculture residue burning. These emissions were estimated to be about 12 MMtCO2e in 2005.
As shown in Figure 7-1, emissions from soil carbon losses from tilling, commercial fertilizer and
livestock manure application to soils, rice cultivation, manure management, enteric fermentation,
and fertilizer application all make significant contributions to the sector totals. Sector emissions
include CO2 emissions from oxidized soil carbon and application of urea and lime; N2O
emissions from activities that increase nitrogen in the soil, including fertilizer (synthetic, organic,
and livestock) application and production of nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes); and CH4 emissions
from rice cultivation.
Rice cultivation is a significant contributor of GHG emissions in Arkansas. Emissions from rice
cultivation comprised 20% (2.1 MMtCO2e) of gross agricultural emissions in 1990. This number
is projected to increase to 31% (3.70 MMtCO2e) of agricultural emissions by 2025. Agricultural
soils emissions are projected to decrease from 1990 to 2025, with 1990 emissions accounting for
45% (4.8 MMtCO2e) of gross agricultural emissions and 2025 emissions estimated to be about
35% (4.2 MMtCO2e) of gross agricultural emissions. Emissions from other agricultural sources
are projected to stay relatively constant through 2025.
Forestland emissions refer to the net carbon dioxide flux 1 from forested lands in Arkansas, which
account for about 57% of the state’s land area. As shown in Table 7-1, U.S. Forest Service
(USFS) data suggest that the total flux estimate for Arkansas forests, including all forest pools,
fluctuates between –43 MMtCO2e/year (between 1988 and 1995) and –18 MMtCO2e/year
(between 1995 and 2005). For the reference case projections (2005–2025), the forest area and
carbon densities of forestlands were assumed to remain at the same levels as in 2005. Table 7-2
provides a summary of the estimated flux for the entire forestry and land use sector.

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Figure 7-2 shows estimated historical and projected emissions from the management and
treatment of solid waste and wastewater. Emissions from waste management consist largely of
CH4 emitted from landfills, while emissions from wastewater treatment include both CH4 and
N2O. Emissions are also included for municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion. Figure 7-2
illustrates that emissions from MSW landfills are projected to increase significantly through
2025. Overall, the waste management sector accounts for less than 5% of Arkansas’s total gross
emissions per year from 1990 through 2025.
Figure 7-2. Estimated historical and projected emissions from waste and wastewater
management in Arkansas

MMtCO2e = million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent; MSW = municipal solid waste.

Opportunities for GHG mitigation in the AFW sector involve measures that can reduce
emissions within the sector or in other sectors. Examples of reductions that can occur within the
sector include changes in crop management practices that reduce GHG emissions by building
soil carbon (indirectly sequestering carbon from the atmosphere); more efficient nutrient
application (reducing N2O emissions—note that emissions outside of the AFW sectors are also
reduced here due to the embedded energy in nutrients and the potential for lower energy
consumption during their application); reforestation projects that achieve GHG reductions by
increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of the state’s forests; and landfill gas collection and
control, which reduces methane emissions from landfills.
For GHG reductions outside of the AFW sector, actions taken within the sector, such as
production of liquid biofuels, can offset emissions in the transportation sector, while biomass
7-3

energy can reduce emissions in the energy supply (ES) and RCI sectors. Similarly, actions that
promote solid waste reduction or recycling can reduce emissions within the AFW sectors (future
landfill CH4), as well as emissions associated with the production of recycled products (recycled
products often require less energy to produce than similar products from raw materials). Finally,
urban forestry projects can reduce energy consumption within buildings through shading and
wind protection.
Following are primary opportunities for GHG mitigation identified by the Governor’s
Commission on Global Warming (GCGW).
!

Manure management: Implementing improved manure handling and storage programs,
practices, and technologies can reduce CH4 and N2O emissions from dairy, hog, and poultry
operations. A variety of sources were considered in attempting to quantify the best manure
management practices to reduce GHG emissions. While it is very likely that manure
management can reduce emissions, the maximum achievable level of emissions reduction is
uncertain.

!

Farming practices that achieve GHG benefits: Implementing programs that incentivize
growers to utilize cultivation practices that build soil carbon and reduce nutrient consumption
can indirectly sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. New technologies in the area of precision
agriculture offer opportunities to reduce nutrient application and fossil fuel consumption.

!

Improving management of water resources: Enhancing current capabilities/capacities of
storing surface water, can make it is available at appropriate times and in the necessary
quantities to reduce pumping and energy consumption, in addition to other ancillary benefits.

!

Expanded use of forest and agricultural biomass: Expanding use of biomass energy from
residue removed from forested areas during treatments to reduce fire risk, crop residues, and
purpose-grown crops, and from livestock manure/poultry litter can achieve GHG benefits by
offsetting fossil fuel consumption (to produce either electricity or heat/steam). Programs to
expand sustainably procured biomass fuel production will most likely be needed to supply a
portion of the fuel mix for the renewable energy goals under ES and RCI.

!

Production of advanced liquid biofuels: Producing renewable fuels, such as ethanol from
energy crops, crop residue, forestry residue, or municipal solid waste and biodiesel from crop
seed oils, can produce significant reductions when they are used to offset consumption of
fossil fuels (e.g., gasoline and diesel in the Transportation and Land Use [TLU] and RCI
sectors). This is particularly true when these fuels are produced using processes and/or
feedstocks that emit much lower GHG emissions than those from conventional sources (e.g.,
corn-based ethanol or soy-based biodiesel).

!

Expanded use of locally produced farm and forest products: Continually promoting
farmers’ markets in the state, along with using locally sourced wood products with lower
embodied energy than other potentially imported building materials, provides benefits
through lower associated transportation emissions and lower embodied GHGs.

!

Enhancement/protection of forest carbon sinks: Through a variety of programs, enhanced
levels of CO2 sequestration can be achieved and carbon can be stored in the state’s forest
biomass. These programs include reforestation programs, restocking of poorly stocked
forests, urban tree programs, wildfire risk reduction, and other forest health programs.
7-4

Programs aimed at reducing the conversion of forested lands to nonforest cover will also be
important to increase levels of carbon sequestration and to protect the stored carbon in the
state’s forest biomass.
!

Changes in municipal solid waste management practices: Concentrating on enhancing the
source reduction, recycling, and organics management (e.g., composting practices) in the
state can result in significant GHG emission reductions. Also, for waste remaining after full
implementation of these “front-end” practices, appropriate GHG-beneficial “end-of-life”
practices should be implemented, including enhanced landfill gas collection and utilization.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Within the forestry sector, Forest Management and Establishment for Carbon Sequestration
programs (AFW-7) have the potential to deliver over 12 MMtCO2e/year of GHG reductions in
2025 (see Table 7-2). These programs include forestation, urban forestry, and sustainable forest
management (e.g., wildfire reduction, restocking, and forest health approaches) to minimize
terrestrial carbon losses, while enhancing carbon sequestration. The overall goal for the
forestation recommendation calls for establishing new forest on 500,000 acres by 2025. For the
sustainable forest management element, the goals are to achieve carbon benefits on 25% of
privately owned land and 17% of publicly owned resource lands by 2025. Appropriate species
selection and placement of trees can provide additional benefits through continuity of wildlife
habitat, wetland buffers and protection, and adaptation to climate change.
For urban forestry, the goals are to increase urban canopy cover in Arkansas. A strong
relationship between all of the related parties is needed (e.g., Arkansas Forestry Commission,
utilities, communities, and nongovernmental organizations) to achieve the full goal of 1.7 million
new trees in urban areas statewide (or a 4% increase in the number of urban trees).
GCGW recommendation AFW-4 promotes the expanded use of biomass as an energy source for
producing electricity, heat, or steam. Use of biomass to supplant fossil fuels was estimated to
reduce over 4 MMtCO2e by 2025. The GCGW conducted a limited assessment of the available
biomass resources in the state, which indicated that sufficient resources were available through
2025 to achieve the goals for both the advanced biofuels recommendation (below) and this
biomass for energy recommendation. The GCGW noted that the expansion of crops as an energy
feedstock needs to ensure that the energy crops are grown on appropriate land and in ways that
do not damage terrestrial or aquatic resources or displace food and fiber production. A key
challenge to the implementation of this recommendation is the proximity of the feedstock to the
end user.
The GCGW found significant opportunity in promoting advanced biofuels production using
feedstocks and production methods with superior GHG benefits (e.g., superior to conventional
starch-based ethanol). The GCGW adopted the definition of “advanced biofuels” provided by the
U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007: Advanced biofuel “means renewable fuel,
other than ethanol derived from corn starch, that has lifecycle GHG emissions, as determined by

7-5

the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for comment, that are at least 50 percent less than
baseline lifecycle GHG emissions.” 2
It should be noted that there is significant overlap in benefits with the TLU-3 (Advanced
Biofuels Development and Expansion) recommendation. However, the GCGW recognizes instate production and consumption result in the highest benefits. An example of biofuels that
could be produced with much better GHG impacts is ethanol from cellulosic hydrolysis of
biomass fiber. Feedstocks for the fiber needed for this recommendation could come from crop
residue, energy crops, forestry residue, or MSW. A major challenge for the success of AFW-5 is
the establishment of a viable commercial-scale cellulosic ethanol or other biofuels industry
within the next 5 to 10 years.
Within the agriculture sector, the GCGW recommends programs to promote farming practices
that achieve GHG benefits, such as soil management programs that increase soil carbon levels,
thereby indirectly sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. These programs, combined with
additional measures to promote nutrient efficiency, were estimated to achieve reductions of over
1.5 MMtCO2e per year by 2025. Programs that would assist farmers in reaching the goals of
these recommendations include the encouragement of research and development of farming
practices and cropping systems that increase carbon input (e.g., reversion to native vegetation,
setting aside agricultural land as grassland, improved crop rotations, yield enhancement
measures, organic amendments, cover crops, improved irrigation practices), or decrease carbon
output (e.g., proper tillage methods), while maintaining crop yield, so that GHG emissions are
reduced.
AFW-8 and AFW-9 provide an integrated set of recommendations for future management of
municipal solid waste in Arkansas. AFW-8 focuses on “front-end” waste management
technologies: source reduction, recycling, and composting, while AFW-9 focuses on “end-ofuse” waste management approaches. The recommendations for AFW-8 represent a continuation
of the recycling policy currently in place in Arkansas; increasing the MSW recycling rate for
GHG-significant solid waste streams by 2% every 5 years where this is geographically costeffective. The combined front-end waste management elements produce substantial GHG
savings of 4.4 MMtCO2e in 2025. Source reduction and recycling will result in avoided landfill
GHG emissions, as well as avoided product/packaging life-cycle GHG emissions.
Although AFW-8 is estimated to deliver net societal cost savings, successful implementation will
require the strengthening of existing (or the introduction of new) recycling legislation, the
provision of incentives/subsidies to the municipalities to have more aggressive recycling efforts
(currently, it is more expensive to recycle than to landfill), and/or the encouragement of
procuring products produced from recycled material. Initial up-front waste management
infrastructure investment by communities in the form of material recovery facilities and
composting operations may also be required. Cost savings result from avoided landfill fees and
the addition of the value of recycled or composted materials. The recommendations provided in
AFW-9 are expected to deliver an additional 0.4 MMtCO2e by 2025.

In addition to the opportunities and challenges indicated above, it is also important for Arkansas
to address the impacts of climate change, including the potential impacts on water resources,
ecosystems, habitat, wildlife, and fisheries. These issues are closely linked to many of the
mitigation recommendations under the AFW sector, but are specifically considered under the
Cross-Cutting Issues recommendations (CC-9: Adaptation and Vulnerability).

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
As noted above, the nine policy recommendations for the AFW sector address a diverse array of
activities. Taken as a whole, they offer significant cost-effective emission reductions, as shown
in Table 7-3.
Figure 7-3 shows the breakdown of the cumulative emission reductions (2009–2025) anticipated
from the recommended actions in the AFW sector. The greatest emission reductions achieved
(67%) come from implementation of forest management and establishment for carbon
sequestration. This policy incorporates programs to improve urban forestry, encourage
afforestation/reforestation, and implement sustainable forestry management practices. Advanced
recovery and recycling (AFW-8), also provides significant GHG benefits (22%) through source
reduction, recycling, and composting. It is important to note that these emission reductions are
life-cycle GHG reductions that occur both within and outside of Arkansas (resulting from lower
energy use and GHG emissions to create, transport, and dispose of new products and packaging
that are avoided through source reduction and recycling). Expanded use of agriculture and
forestry biomass feedstocks for electricity, heat, or steam production (AFW-4) and expanded use
of advanced biofuels (AFW-5) both offer significant GHG reductions. However, AFW-4 and
AFW-5 overlap with recommendations under the ES and TLU Technical Work Groups,
respectively. After accounting for overlap, these policies contribute a significantly smaller
proportion to the AFW sector total.

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management Sectors
Policy Descriptions

The AFW sectors include emission mitigation opportunities related to the use of biomass energy,
protection and enhancement of forest and agricultural carbon sinks, control of agricultural CH4
and N2O emissions, production of renewable liquid fuels, production of additional biomass
energy, forestation on nonforested lands, and an increase in municipal solid waste source
reduction, recycling, composting, and landfill gas collection.
AFW-1

Manure Management

This policy recommendation promotes the use of improved manure management practices that
reduce GHG emissions associated with manure handling and storage, including manure
composting to reduce CH4 emissions, movement of manure from nutrient-rich to nutrientdeficient areas, and improved methods for application to fields (for reduced N2O emissions).
Application improvements include incorporating manure into soil instead of surface spraying or
spreading.
AFW-2

Promotion of Farming Practices That Achieve GHG Benefits

This policy recommendation addresses both agricultural soil carbon management and nutrient
management to achieve GHG benefits. For soil carbon management, conservation-oriented
management of agricultural lands, cropping systems, crop management, and agricultural
practices may regulate the net flux of CO2 from soil. Each farm operation and each field
management unit has unique traits that may allow management practices to influence nutrient,
water, and carbon cycling and sequestration.
The efficient use of agricultural fertilizer, both commercial and animal-based, can be improved
through certain management practices and systems. An example is overapplication of nitrogen,
which can result in plants not fully metabolizing the nitrogen, allowing the nitrogen to leach into
groundwater and/or be emitted to the atmosphere as N2O. Better nutrient utilization can lead to
lower N2O emissions from runoff. An example is tile drainage systems that use the latest
technology and design models to reduce nitrates leaching into surface water and groundwater.
AFW-3

Improved Water Management and Use

The focus of this policy is on improving water management and use. Using surface water versus
groundwater and decreasing water consumption both reduce pumping and energy consumption.
Additionally, excess surface water can lead to runoff of nitrogen, with subsequent emission of
N2O to the atmosphere. Managing and improving water consumption and nutrients spread on
crops will result in a minimal loss of carbon from the soil. Reusing water can create nutrient
management problems, and must be considered when implementing this policy.

7-10

AFW-4

Expanded Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, or
Steam Production

This policy dedicates a sustainable quantity of biomass from agricultural industry residues,
agricultural lands, wood industry process residues, unused forestry residues, agroforestry
resources, dedicated energy crops, MSW, and livestock manure and poultry litter to efficient
conversion to heat, steam, or electricity. This biomass should be collected and used in an
environmentally acceptable manner, considering proper facility siting and feedstock use (e.g.,
proximity of users to biomass, impacts on water supply and quality, control of air emissions,
solid waste management, cropping management, nutrient management, soil and nonsoil carbon
management, and impacts on biodiversity and wildlife habitat). The objective is to create
concurrent reduction of GHG emissions due to displacement of fossil fuel, considering life-cycle
emissions associated with viable collection, hauling, and energy conversion and distribution
systems. An additional GHG benefit is obtained through reduced methane emissions resulting
from the capture of emissions from manure and poultry litter. Additional benefits can be
achieved through the capture and use of waste heat from biomass facilities, where the waste heat
could be used for cogeneration to displace heating costs and fossil fuel use. Local electricity or
steam production yields the greatest net energy payoff.
Note: This recommendation is linked with some Energy Supply and Residential, Commercial and
Industrial renewable energy recommendations (i.e., ES-3a, ES-6, RCI-7, and RCI-8). AFW-4
focuses on the supply elements of the implementation of a biomass-to-energy program (e.g.,
availability, collection, and distribution), while the ES/RCI recommendations focus on the
demand side (e.g., generation infrastructure and purchasing for consumers).
AFW-5

Expanded Use of Advanced Biofuels

This policy promotes sustainable in-state production of advanced biofuels from agriculture,
forestry and MSW feedstocks (raw materials) to displace the use of conventional petroleumbased fuels. It also promotes advanced biofuel production systems that improve the embedded
energy content and carbon profile of biofuels. It focuses on feedstocks that produce advanced
biofuels with significantly lower embedded GHG emissions compared to conventional fuel
products (from a life-cycle perspective).
This policy also promotes the in-state development of feedstocks, such as cellulosic material and
perennials that are able to be utilized. Recognizing that conversion technologies, such as thermochemical Fischer-Tropsch processes and enzymatic conversion, are developing fast in this sector,
the policy recommends facilitating, but not requiring, their development and establishment in
Arkansas.
Note: This recommendation is linked with the Transportation and Land Use recommendation
TLU-3 (Advanced Biofuels Development and Expansion). AFW-5 focuses on the supply elements
of the implementation of a biofuels program, while TLU-3 focuses on the demand side (e.g.,
vehicle technology requirements, E10, E85).

7-11

AFW-6

Expanded Use of Locally Produced Farm and Forest Products

AFW-6 focuses on the production and consumption of locally produced agricultural and forest
products to displace the consumption of goods transported from other states or countries, and
thus reduce transportation-related GHG emissions. Additionally, increasing the amount of
renewable wood products used for residential and commercial buildings can increase carbon
sequestration in wood products and displace GHG emissions associated with processing highenergy input materials, such as steel, plastic, and concrete.
AFW-7

Forest Management and Establishment for Carbon Sequestration

Arkansas’ forests and forest management have a significant role to play in the state’s strategies
to reduce or offset GHGs and adapt to future climate effects. This policy establishes or reestablishes forests on land not currently forested, such as fallow or marginal agricultural land
(“afforestation”); promotes retaining forest cover and associated carbon stocks by regenerating
forests (“reforestation” or “restoration”); helps maintain and improve the health and longevity of
trees in urban and residential areas (urban forestry); and implements, in a carbon-sensitive
manner, such practices as site preparation, erosion control, and stand stocking to ensure
conditions that support forest growth.
Forest management activities promote forest productivity and increase the rate of CO2
sequestration in forest biomass and soils and in harvested wood products. The urban forestry
component also has the potential to reduce fossil fuel consumption through shading and wind
protection of homes and commercial buildings. Reducing the severity of wildfires can reduce
GHG emissions by lowering the forest carbon lost during a fire and maintaining carbon
sequestration potential. Similarly, reducing damage from insects, disease, and invasive plants
decreases GHG emissions by maintaining the carbon sequestration potential of healthy forests.
The implementation of this recommendation also needs to consider non-GHG benefits, such as
the provision of wildlife habitat, biodiversity, and stream buffers and improvement of water
quality.
AFW-8

Advanced Recovery and Recycling

Advanced recovery and recycling promotes the reduction of the volume of waste produced, as
well as reduction in consumption through incentives, awareness, and increased efficiency. Three
major areas of focus in Arkansas are source reduction, organic waste management, and advanced
recycling. This policy builds on the statutory recycling goal of 45% by 2010 and provides GHG
benefits not only from avoided disposal emissions, but also from product life-cycle emission
reductions (associated with the manufacture and transport of new packaging and products).
Redirecting organic wastes (such as food, yard, and paper) from landfills into composting
programs is very effective at reducing GHG emissions. To be successful, this policy
recommendation needs to promote reuse and recycling through best management practices for
corporations, businesses, and government organizations.

7-12

AFW-9

End-of-Use Waste Management Practices

This policy promotes activities that further reduce GHG production by encouraging the use of
energy recovery technologies. The focus is on the utilization of methane at landfills through the
enabling of anaerobic digesters to capture and utilize that energy through electric power, heating,
or liquefied natural gas. These technologies will help reduce GHG emissions from waste
management, while producing cleaner energy. They make a two-fold contribution to climate
protection, by reducing emissions of methane and other GHGs into the atmosphere (via
collection and control), and offsetting energy that would have otherwise come from fossil fuels.
For example, the emissions created by landfills (methane) can be used to make electricity that
would have otherwise been produced from fossil-based feedstocks, such as natural gas or coal.

Chapter 8
Review of Current Scientific Literature on Causes and
Impacts of Global Warming
The Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 127 S.Ct. 1438
(2007), stated:
A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase
in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the
two trends are related. For when carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, it acts
like the ceiling of a greenhouse, trapping solar energy and retarding the escape of
reflected heat. It is therefore a species—the most important species—of a "greenhouse
gas.”
Consistent with the findings of the Supreme Court, there is a broad scientific consensus that,
over the last two centuries, there is a 90%–95% probability that human activities have increased
amounts of important greenhouse gases (GHGs, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous
oxide, and fluorocarbons) 1 in the atmosphere to levels not seen in all of prior human experience,
and likely not seen for 3 million years. This consensus has been reflected in Climate Change
2007: The Physical Science Basis. Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC 2007), and in at least three reports of the National Research Council of
the National Academy of Sciences (NAS/NRC): Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some
Key Questions (2001), Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises (2002), and Surface
Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years (2006). These findings are also reflected
in the summary of science prepared by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the
Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Regulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions Under the
Clean Air Act (July 30, 2008).
As reflected in these reports, it is likely or very likely that human-induced increases in these
GHGs are already causing global climate to warm. Human activities likely caused most of the
approximately 0.6 oC (1.1 oF) rise over the 20th century. 2 The mean ocean temperature has risen
by 0.05 oC (0.09 oF), global average sea level has risen by 0.1–0.2 meters (1/3–2/3 feet) over the
20th century, and snow cover and Arctic ice have decreased by about 10% and 10%–15%,
respectively, since the late 1960s (when data first became available for this measurement).3
Various other climate factors are changing consistent with warming induced by GHGs. By
contrast, we know of no measures of climate on the global scale that indicate cooling. It is
virtually certain that what has been observed so far is only the beginning, and that continued
1

Water vapor is a GHG and is an important amplifier of climate change because its atmospheric concentrations tend
to increase when the atmosphere and surface waters warm up. Anthropogenic emissions of water vapor to the
atmosphere by automobiles and other combustion sources do not significantly affect global atmospheric
concentrations of water vapor relative to the natural evaporation and condensation processes.

GHG emissions along current trajectories will cause additional warming of the Earth system as a
whole. The average time for removal from the atmosphere of added carbon dioxide is measured
in centuries. It is very likely that such perturbation would cause the rate of surface warming and
sea level rise in the 21st century to be substantially larger and faster than that experienced in the
20th century, without precedent in the past 10,000 years.
The evidence that anthropogenic emissions of GHGs have already affected the climate includes
the following observations:
!

Ocean temperature has increased to depths of at least 3,000 meters.

!

Global sea levels rose by 1.7 millimeters per year (mm/yr) during the 20th century and by 3.1
mm/yr during 1993–2003. There is high scientific confidence that the rate of rise increased
during the 20th century.

!

The average Arctic temperature has increased at twice the global average.

!

Summer Arctic sea ice has shrunk at 7.4% per decade since 1978.

!

Mountain glaciers have declined in both hemispheres.

!

There is a trend toward less snow at low altitudes.

!

Atmospheric water vapor content has increased (consistent with the effect of increased air
temperature).

!

There has been an increase in precipitation over many large regions (the Northern
Hemisphere, in general, and eastern North America).

!

There have been more intense, longer droughts in many regions.

!

There has been less rainfall in African Sahel, southern Africa, and southern Asia.

!

The frequency of heavy rainfall events has increased over most land areas.

!

There have been widespread increases in hot days and nights, and heat waves.

!

Various ecological changes have been observed, including impacts on nesting behavior,
insect and disease outbreaks, and species distribution.

On the other hand, to date, there have been no observed effects upon:
!

Global average diurnal temperature range.

!

Antarctic sea ice extent.

!

Tornadoes, hail, lightning, and dust storms.

!

Meridional overturning circulation in the global ocean, which would lead to cooling of
Europe.

A variety of impacts will affect Arkansas and the southeastern United States, particularly if
emissions of GHGs are not limited. These impacts include the following:

8-2

!

There will be increased storminess, with increases in floods, windstorms, and, in some
places, ice storms.

!

Floodplains will likely increase in extent as larger floods increase in frequency. Ground-level
ozone pollution will be exacerbated. Tropical and insect-borne diseases will move north.

!

There will be increased heat-related deaths and decreased cold-related deaths.

!

Although less likely to impact Arkansas directly, there will be adverse impacts on winter
sports that will reduce the snow season in resorts.

!

There will be strains on water supplies, particularly in western states, which will witness a
decreased snowpack.

!

There will be increased drought stress, because there will be less precipitation during summer
months and more during winter months, putting further stress on water supplies.

!

The increases in drought stress and storminess are likely to have an adverse impact upon
agriculture and forestry.

!

Sea levels will rise, putting stress on coastal areas and causing salt-water intrusion into
coastal aquifers. Sea levels are expected to rise by 1–2 feet by 2100 due to thermal expansion,
alone. However, the sea level rise could be much greater due to melting of the Greenland or
Antarctic glaciers.

!

Rising sea levels, increased drought stress, and impacts on agriculture will also become “a
[national security] threat multiplier for instability in some of the most volatile regions of the
world.” 4 This insecurity may affect Arkansas.

!

Cold-water fisheries will decline.

!

Coral reefs and related fisheries will be adversely affected by ocean acidification caused by
increased carbon dioxide levels.

!

Climatic hardiness zones will move north and the distribution of vegetation and wildlife will
change. This will likely put stress upon vulnerable species.

There is also a danger of severe and sudden impacts whose likelihood cannot be assessed, as
reflected in the NAS/NRC report Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises (2002). The
glaciers in the Antarctic and Greenland provide a 100,000-year history that show that climate
was far more variable before the beginning of human civilization. This history raises the concern
that there may be more extreme results as a result of increasing atmospheric GHG levels. Over
the last 5,000 years, climate has been very stable, but the norm is rapid and wild fluctuation. If a
forcing element, such as levels of GHGs in the atmosphere, changes considerably, it is possible
that we could pass a threshold and flip a switch that would cause the climate to undergo rapid
change that could include dramatically warmer or colder temperatures or rapid changes in sea
level. We cannot predict when continental glaciers will collapse and how fast this will occur. The
fossil record shows that there have been 5-meter rises in sea level in the shortest interval that can

be read (10 years). A recent study has found that melting of continental glaciers could cause a
rise of as much as 3–6 feet by 2100, in addition to the 1–2-foot rise predicted as a result of
thermal expansion. In light of recent evidence, James Hansen has expressed the following
concern:
Crystallizing scientific data and analysis reveal that the Earth is close to dangerous
climate change, to tipping points of the system with the potential for irreversible
deleterious effects. 5
Several individuals have pointed to publications and speeches by “climate skeptics” that appear
to present contrary views. However, these publications have not been peer reviewed. Peerreviewed scientific literature has unanimously endorsed the views in the IPCC and NAC/NRC
reports described above. 6 In fact, the individuals who raise “questions” about the consensus view
are not disagreeing about the science, but are confusing science and policy, disagreeing with the
default position dictated by applicable law for addressing residual face of uncertainty, and quite
frequently basing their view on largely unsupported and sometimes unstated assumptions
regarding the relative environmental and economic risks of error.
Moreover, there is no disagreement that there are some uncertainties regarding the degree of risk
from GHG atmospheric increases, the timing of impacts and, in some cases, even the nature of
some risks. The critics suggest that economic concerns regarding response suggest that we
should not take action unless it is virtually certain that very bad things will happen. However,
applicable law, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the
federal Clean Air Act, require that actions be taken to limit emissions if there is a risk of serious
harm, rather than a certainty. Thus, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change, which has been ratified by the United States, provides:
The Parties should take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent or minimize the
causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse effects. Where there are threats of
serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a
reason for postponing such measures, taking into account that policies and measures to
deal with climate change should be cost-effective so as to ensure global benefits at the
lowest possible cost. 7

A similar or identical precautionary standard appears in many sections of the federal Clean Air
Act. Thus, section 202(a)(1), which was construed by the United States Supreme Court in
Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency provides as follows:
The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe . . . standards applicable to the emission
of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle
engines, which in his judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may
reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.
The applicable science meets this standard, and no skeptic says that there is a reasonable
scientific certainty that there will not be adverse impacts from rising GHG levels.

Description of the Arkansas Governor's Commission
on Global Warming Process
Memorandum
To:

Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global Warming

From: The Center for Climate Strategies
Re:

Work Plan for Launch of the Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global Warming
Process

Date: February 7, 2008
This memorandum outlines the proposed work plan for the Arkansas Governor’s Commission on
Global Warming (Commission). Initially the purpose and goals of the process are described,
including the proposed general outline of the final report and the overall timing and milestones.
Also described are the design of the process, including key principles and guidelines. A set of
general Commission meeting agendas follows, showing the progression of the process over time.
Lastly, an outline of the budget and funding plan is presented, along with a description of the
project team.
Purpose and Goals of the Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global Warming
With the signing of Act 696 of the Arkansas 86th General Assembly (HB2460), Governor Mike
Beebe established the Governor’s Commission on Global Warming. Seventeen of the twenty-one
members of the Commission are appointed by the Governor, and two members each are
appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Arkansas State Senate and by the Speaker of the
Arkansas House of Representatives. The Commission is charged with setting a “global warming
pollution reduction goal” and a “comprehensive strategic plan for implementation of the global
warming pollution reduction goal.” The Act contains several study and evaluation requirements
related to both action and inaction scenarios, and requires a final report to be provided to the
Governor by November 1, 2008, in order to provide findings to the Eighty-Seventh General
Assembly. In addition, the Commission is charged with establishing and appointing an Advisory
Body composed of the directors of the following state agencies: Agriculture Department,
Department of Environmental Quality, Forestry Commission, Highway and Transportation
Department, Natural Resources Commission, Public Service Commission, State Game and Fish
Commission, Department of Economic Development, Department of Parks and Tourism, and Oil
and Gas Commission.
The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) will aid the Arkansas Governor’s Commission on
Global Warming in its examination and evaluation of the “…issues related to global warming on
the state, its citizens, its natural resources, and its economy.” By following a detailed work plan
and policy development process, CCS will provide administrative, technical, facilitative,
informational, and document development support toward the development of an Arkansas
B-1

Climate Action Plan to Governor Beebe by November 1, 2008. The development of an Arkansas
Climate Action Plan will address the directives of the Act with respect to establishing a global
warming (greenhouse gas (GHG)) reduction goal for Arkansas and a comprehensive strategic
plan and final report for its implementation.
To support these needs, CCS will provide critical startup planning and technical support
activities, followed by the launch and management of a Climate Action Plan process in 2008.
CCS will work in partnership with and under the direction of the Commission and Governor’s
Office as an impartial and expert party throughout the startup and management of the Climate
Action Plan process.
The following presents a proposed work plan for startup, management, and completion of an
Arkansas Climate Action Plan process to support the mission of the Commission under Act 696
of the Arkansas 86th General Assembly. CCS will provide administrative, informational and
educational, facilitative, and advanced technical support to serve the needs of the Commission.
As stated by Act 696, the purpose of the Commission process is to place Arkansas in a position
to help stabilize the global climate, to allow Arkansas to lead the nation in attracting clean and
renewable energy industries to the state, and to reduce consumer energy dependence on current
carbon-generating technologies and expenditures. The primary duties outlined in Act 696 task
the Commission to:
(1)

Conduct an in-depth examination of the potential causes and impacts of global warming on
the state, its citizens, its natural resources, and its economy; and

(2)

Assess global warming mitigation strategies by :
a. Establishing a global warming pollutant reduction goal, and
b. Developing a comprehensive strategic plan for implementation of the global warming
pollution reduction goal, to be presented in a final report to the 87th General Assembly
for consideration.

The Commission process will follow the format of CCS policy development processes used
successfully in a number current and completed state-level climate action planning initiatives.
This consensus-building model supports informed and collaborative self-determination by a
broadly representative group of designated stakeholders and technical experts. The supported
process of the Commission will be transparent, inclusive, stepwise, fact-based, and consensus
driven. The process will seek but not mandate consensus and will use formal voting to determine
the level of support for individual policy options. (See key principles and guidelines section for
additional detail.) CCS conducts all of its stakeholder processes in compliance with the “Model
Standards of Conduct for Mediators,” published in August 2005 by the American Arbitration
Association, American Bar Association, and Association for Conflict Resolution.
As an impartial party, CCS does not take positions on climate policy issues or legislation. CCS
supports the purpose and goals of the Executive Orders or other directives that establish its
processes (such as Act 696 of the Arkansas 86th General Assembly), and does not dispute the
findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the National Academies of
Science (NAS) on the science of climate change often-cited in Executive Orders establishing
planning processes.

B-2

The deliverables will be implemented by CCS in three integrated tasks:
I. Preliminary Evaluations.
II. GHG Inventory and Forecast Assessment.
III. Climate Action Plan Process.
Task I – Preliminary Evaluations – will include an extensive review of the science and current
state and federal actions that could affect decisions of the State of Arkansas and further baseline
assessments to educate and inform the Commission as it designs and develops a global warming
pollutant reduction goal. During this initial task, CCS will:
(1) Review, summarize, and evaluate the scientific and technical literature available on both
the causes of global warming and the potential impacts on Arkansas, its citizens, its
natural resources, and its economy, including agriculture, travel, tourism, recreation,
insurance, and economic growth and development. By assessing climate change impacts
in Arkansas, CCS will help the Commission determine whether the development of a
state climate adaptation strategy is necessary. This review will include, among other
scientific literature, the Fourth Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change and a summary of potential state impacts and vulnerabilities by a state climate
science panel assembled for this purpose. CCS will also identify other key studies and
assessments related to climate change mitigation options in Arkansas. This in-depth
examination will serve to educate and advise Commission members on the technical and
scientific aspects of climate change. CCS has demonstrated experience in successfully
forming science advisory panels. For example, in Arizona, it assisted the state in forming
a science panel to serve as a resource for the Arizona Climate Change Advisory Group;
to conduct an assessment of the effects of climate change on water resources; and, to
assist the state with pubic education programs. Members of the CCS team have extensive
experience in developing scientific assessments, reviews and briefings, including court
proceedings, legislative commissions and hearings, peer reviewed academic literature,
and graduate school curricula.
(2) Identify and assess multi-state and federal climate policy issues and options that could
affect decisions of the State of Arkansas. CCS will review for the Commission its
comprehensive compendium of state and federal actions, including over 300 actions
taken and/or considered by U.S. states, regions and/or the federal government to reduce
GHG emissions in tandem with other economic benefits and cost savings.
(3) Identify existing state actions in Arkansas that reduce GHG emissions, and assess the
GHG reduction potential of key actions recently implemented and/or formally planned by
the state.
(4) Assist in the identification of potential early actions by the State to address climate
change policy needs.
(5) Evaluate the economic opportunities for the State of Arkansas from the carbon market
now emerging as a result of existing international, national, and local efforts to address
global warming.
(6) Assist in the identification of technical experts in Arkansas for possible membership in
Technical Work Groups (TWGs) during the climate action planning process.
B-3

(7) Assist in the development of communications tools to support the climate action planning
process, including a project website, document templates, and other tools.
(8) Provide visible and written aids to assist the Commission in understanding the climate
science, opportunity, and policy environment throughout the duration of the
Commission’s charge.
Task II – GHG Inventory and Forecast Assessment – will include the following task and
subtasks by CCS:
(1) Develop a draft inventory and forecast of Arkansas greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
from 1990 to 2025. This assessment will document a reference case for emissions that
includes evaluation of existing and planned actions, as well as reference case forecasts at
the sector and sub-sector level for all GHGs recognized by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The GHG inventory and
forecast report will be reviewed by the Commission as the backdrop for its discussion
regarding the establishment of a global warming pollutant (or GHG) reduction goal. CCS
has produced numerous state of the art assessments of state level GHG emissions
inventories and forecasts.
Task III – Climate Action Plan Process – will include the following management, facilitation,
and technical support tasks related to the Climate Action Plan process; the final report reflecting
the comprehensive strategic plan and strategies and the statewide global warming pollutant
reduction goal developed by the Commission; and implementation support to the Commission in
its work with the Governor and the 87th General Assembly. CCS has assisted several states in the
development of consensus based comprehensive GHG reduction plans and statewide goals.
(1) Facilitation of six or more structured climate action planning meetings of the
Commission and a series of interim meetings of five TWGs to identify, prioritize,
develop, and quantify final recommendations to be brought forward in the Commission’s
comprehensive Climate Action Plan.
(2) Development of a comprehensive set of specific policy recommendations by the
Commission in the form of a strategic implementation plan to reduce GHG emissions and
enhance energy and economic opportunity in Arkansas by 2025 and beyond. This will
include detailed analyses of GHG reduction potential and cost or cost savings (i.e., cost
effectiveness) for each recommended policy option as appropriate (some measures may
not require quantification, such as reporting or education) as well as the aggregate
impacts of the implementation plan. Consistent with Act 696, the projected costs of
delayed actions will also be considered, as will the potential benefits of recommended
actions on individuals, households, local and state governments, businesses, educational
institutions, agriculture operations, medical institutions, and other sectors the
Commission may identify. CCS has conducted numerous state of the art costeffectiveness evaluations and other economic assessments of GHG reduction strategies at
the state, regional and national level through advisory group processes.
(3) Facilitate and provide technical support to the Commission’s process to establish a
recommended statewide global warming pollutant (or GHG) reduction goal to be met by
implementation of the comprehensive climate action plan developed by the Commission.
B-4

CCS has facilitated the establishment of statewide GHG reduction goals in several states
as well as the western region.
(4) Issuance by November 1, 2008 of recommendations in the form of a final report from the
Commission to the Governor and for consideration by the 87th General Assembly. At the
end of the detailed technical and planning process, CCS will prepare a comprehensive
report addressing the most appropriate actions for Arkansas to pursue through legislation,
rules, regulations, and voluntary actions to achieve its global warming pollutant (GHG)
reduction goal. CCS will ensure – through its consensus-based policy development
process model – that all recommendations reflect the highest levels of consensus building
possible among the members of the Commission while also addressing the full set of
charges to the Commission. The final report to the Governor and the 87th General
Assembly that compiles and summarizes final Climate Action Plan recommendations of
the Commission will include:
a. Executive Summary
b. Status and Summary of Climate Change Science and Potential Impacts of Climate
Change on Arkansas
c. History and Status of State Actions Related to GHG Emissions
d. Inventory and Forecast of Arkansas GHG Emissions
e. Recommended Policy Actions by Sector:
i. Energy Supply
ii. Residential, Commercial, and Industrial
iii. Transportation and Land Use
iv. Agriculture, Forestry and Waste Management
v. Cross-Cutting Issues, including Emissions Reporting, Registries, Goals Public
Education, and other issues
vi. Technical Appendices
(5) Assistance to the Commission in dialogue with the Governor of Arkansas and in briefings
and testimony before the 87th General Assembly through April 2009 (or the end of the
legislative session) to ensure effective implementation of the legislative initiatives
recommended in the comprehensive Climate Action Plan developed by the Commission.
(6) In addition, CCS provides advanced economic analysis and modeling capabilities for
potential policy recommendations, including cost-effectiveness evaluations of individual
strategies to reduce GHG emissions as well as the cumulative impacts of a
comprehensive GHG reduction plan to achieve global warming pollutant reduction goals
set by the Commission. The expertise of the CCS team includes the ability to perform a
comprehensive array of advanced economic analyses that are customized to the
preferences and needs of the Commission and its TWGs. These include: development of
Mitigation Abatement Cost (MAC) estimates and curves for individual and aggregate
policy options (i.e., cost effectiveness); Differential Labor Impact Analysis; Value Added
Impacts; Income Impacts (including distributional effects on different income classes);
Emissions Trading Design and Impacts including GHG Allowance (Permit) Prices;
Energy Price Impact Analysis; Transportation System Modeling; Forestry and
Agriculture System Modeling; and Macroeconomic Modeling through Dynamic
Equilibrium Modeling or other methods. Economic modeling to be performed by CCS
B-5

for recommended policy options will be determined by the Commission, with assistance
by CCS and TWGs, on a case-by-case basis based on facilitated discussions and available
resources.
Project Schedule. Task I of the CCS work plan will begin in January 2008, focusing on
the preparation of an in-depth review and evaluation of literature on climate change
science (causes and impacts), existing state and federal policy actions, and analysis on
how Arkansas can contribute to and benefit from concerted action to address climate
change. The first full meeting of the Commission’s climate action planning process will
be held in February 7, 2008, with five additional meetings and a final report to be
completed by November 1, 2008. Should the Commission desire to extend the length of
the process, CCS can provide assistance as needed. Two or more TWG teleconference
meetings for each of the five TWGs will be held between each of the Commission
meetings. The Commission’s climate action planning process is expected to proceed
according to the following draft schedule:

6. Technical Appendices
Design of the Process
The Commission’s climate action planning process will echo the format of several successful
state climate action processes conducted by CCS (available through www.climatestrategies.us).
This consensus building model combines techniques of alternative dispute resolution,
community collaborative decision-making, and corporate strategic planning in a combined form
of facilitation and technical analysis known as “evaluative facilitation.” The process will
conform directly to the purpose, duties, staffing, meeting, and reporting requirements as outlined
in SECTIONS 5 through 10 of Act 696.
The process fully integrates group decisions and technical analysis through open, informed, and
collaborative decision-making and self-determination by a broadly representative group of
stakeholders (the Commission), with the support of TWGs that are comprised of Commission
members and others. Activities of the Commission will be transparent, inclusive, stepwise, factbased, and consensus driven (see key principles and guidelines of the process listed below). The
process will seek but not mandate consensus on individual policy option recommendations and
will use formal voting to identify potential objections and alternatives.
The climate action planning process relies on intensive use of information and interaction
between facilitators, participants, and technical analysts. The CCS team provides close
coordination and support for the activities of the Commission and its TWGs, including
facilitation and technical support. To facilitate learning, collaboration, and task completion by
the Commission and TWGs, CCS will provide a series of discussion and decision templates for
each step in the structured planning process, including:
!

A public website for all information and proceedings of the process at
www.arclimatechange.us;

!

Standard meeting documents, including: agenda and notice, discussion PowerPoint,
meeting summary, and reference documents formatted for each of the Commission and
TWG meetings;

!

A draft final report, PowerPoint presentation, and series of worksheets for review and
approval of the GHG emissions inventory and forecasts for the State;

!

An initial master catalog of state and multi-state GHG reduction policy options with brief
descriptions for each option, suggested ranking criteria, draft rank of potential for GHG
B-7

reductions and costs or cost savings for each action;
!

An assessment of the emissions savings and other impacts of actions recently adopted in
Arkansas;

!

A balloting form for identification of initial priorities for analysis for each of the sectorbased TWGs;

!

Templates for the development and analysis of individual policy option
recommendations;

!

A document describing the techniques and methods used for quantifying GHG reductions
and costs or cost savings associated with each of the policy options being considered;

!

Analysis materials, including documentation of key data sources, assumptions, models,
methods, and printouts of worksheets as needed;

!

A final report format with summary chapters and technical appendices; and

!

Other documents will be developed by CCS as needed to support the Commission.

The Commission and TWG process will reflect the following key principles and guidelines:
The process is fully transparent. All materials considered by the Commission and TWGs are
posted to the project website, and all meetings are open to the public. CCS will follow state
meeting law requirements in the notice and conduct of meetings and votes, as needed. For TWG
teleconference meetings (some in-person meetings are possible), the State will arrange for
physical locations with a telephone and a telephone monitor so that the public can listen. The
quantification of potential policy options is transparent with respect to data sources, methods,
key assumptions, and uncertainties. In addition, policy design parameters and implementation
methods for recommended actions are explicit and transparent, including goal levels, timing,
coverage of parties, and implementation mechanisms. The transparency of technical analysis,
policy design, and participant viewpoints is critical to the identification and resolution of
potential conflicts.
The process is inclusive. A diverse group of Commission and TWG members are chosen by the
State to represent a broad spectrum of interests and expertise in Arkansas. The public is afforded
the opportunity to provide meaningful review of and comment upon pending Commission
decisions.
The process is stepwise. Each step of the sequential process builds incrementally on the former
toward a final solution. Sufficient time, information, and interaction are provided between steps
to ensure comfort with decisions and quality of results. Participants are responsible for staying
current with information developed by and decisions of the process, and decisions are not
reconsidered once voted upon.
The process will seek but not mandate consensus. CCS will facilitate votes of the Commission at
each of the major milestones in the process in order to advance to next steps, consistent with
state procedural requirements. Voting is conducted by simple request for objection at the point of
decision (by hand), followed by resolution of conflicts through discussion and development of
alternatives, as needed, in order to proceed. Final votes by the Commission on specific individual
recommendations include support at three levels, including: Unanimous consent (no objection),
Super-majority (typically five objections or fewer), and Majority (fewer than half object).
B-8

Typically, the early stages of the process proceed with unanimous consent or super-majority.
Final recommendations may include recommendations at all three levels, depending on the
Arkansas-specific process developed for the Commission. The final report will document the
level of Commission support for individual recommended options, including barriers to
consensus and suggested alternatives for those recommendations with less than unanimous
support.
The process is comprehensive. The Commission will explore solutions in all sectors and across
all potential implementation methods. Recommendations may include state-level and multi-state
actions (regional and national) as well as potential effects of international actions. Mitigation of
all GHGs will be examined. Units will be expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMTCO2e). Significant actions taken by the executive or legislative branches during
the process will be included as updates to the reference case forecast of emissions.
The process is guided by clear decision criteria for the selection and design of recommended
actions. These include consideration of: (1) GHG reduction potential; (2) cost or cost savings per
ton of GHG emissions removed (i.e., cost effectiveness); (3) potential co-benefits, including
economic and energy policy improvements; and (4) potential feasibility issues (technical,
economic, political, institutional). Consistent with Act 696, the projected costs of delayed actions
will also be considered, as will the potential benefits of recommended actions on individuals,
households, local and state governments, businesses, educational institutions, agriculture
operations, medical institutions, and other sectors the Commission may identify.
The process is quantitative. Results of Commission decisions will include explicit descriptions of
policy design parameters and results of economic analysis (referred to as cost-effectiveness
analysis in the Act). Recommendations can include both quantified and non-quantified actions,
depending on preferences of the Commission, with emphasis on quantification of GHG reduction
potential and cost or cost savings for as many recommendations as possible. Additional
quantification needs related to co-benefits, externalities, or feasibility issues will be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis pending Commission input and available resources.
The process covers short-, medium-, and long-term periods of action. The period of analysis for
emissions inventories and reference case projections will be 1990-2025, with assessment of later
periods being optional and consistent with available resources. Emission reduction options and
related energy and economic analyses are expected to cover the period from the present to 2025,
with supplemental analysis also possible for longer periods if resources permit.
The process is implementation oriented. The goal of the process is the ultimate adoption of
specific policies by the State of Arkansas based on the recommendations of the Commission and
subsequent, more detailed analyses as needed. Accordingly, recommendations of the
Commission are intended to support policy adoption, but may not necessarily comprise the level
of detail necessary for final programmatic implementation, e.g., rulemaking, institutional design,
funding, etc. This predisposition toward implementation is consistent with Act 696 in its specific
intent to help stabilize the climate, allow Arkansas to lead the nation in attracting clean and
renewable energy industries to the State, and reduce consumer dependence on current, carbongenerating technologies and expenditures.
The TWG process is fully integrated with the Commission and facilitated by the CCS team under
the coordination of the Commission. Under this approach, TWGs are comprised of members of
the Commission and/or their staff, may have additional technical members appointed by the
B-9

Governor, and serve in an advisory role to the Commission. The TWGs are structured around the
following sectors: Transportation; Energy Supply; Residential, Commercial and Industrial;
Agriculture, Forestry and Waste; and Cross-Cutting Issues. The TWGs will also consider global
warming science and impacts issues, as called for in Act 696.

Participant Roles and Responsibilities
The Commission process involves a number of parties with specific roles and responsibilities, as
follows:
Governor
The Governor convenes the climate action plan process at the first meeting of the Commission at
the State Capitol, with further meetings held at the call of the co-chairs of the Commission. The
Commission must report its findings and recommendations to the Governor on or before
November 1, 2008, in order to report its findings and recommendations to the 87th General
Assembly.
Center for Climate Strategies
The Governor and the Commission have asked CCS to partner in forming and conducting a
participatory statewide climate action planning process to meet the goals of the Commission.
CCS will work in partnership with the Commission to achieve the overall goals of the process. In
this role, CCS will design the Commission process and provide facilitation and technical support
to the Commission and its TWGs through a team of project managers, facilitators, and technical
analysts to support Commission needs.
CCS serves as an impartial and expert party and does not take positions on issues or direct the
parties toward particular solutions. As such, CCS serves as a group mediator, but not as an
arbitrator. CCS will manage and facilitate meetings and votes during meetings, schedule
meetings in coordination with the Chair, develop meeting agendas, produce documents for the
Commission and TWG consideration, and perform and present technical analysis.
CCS abides by the Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators approved by the American
Arbitration Association, the Litigation Section and the Dispute Resolution Section of the
American Bar Association, and the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution. CCS also
ensures that adequate funding exists to successfully complete the process through private
sources, as needed.
The Commission
Seventeen of the twenty-one members of the Commission are appointed by the Governor, and
two members each are appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Arkansas State Senate and
by the Speaker of the Arkansas House of Representatives. The Commission makes final
recommendations for specific climate policy actions and approves a final Arkansas GHG
emissions inventory and forecast. Commission members are appointed to respond to the goals
and timelines of the process. CCS will facilitate Commission activities, provide supporting
analysis of options under consideration, and deliberate and cast votes in an open-group format.

B-13

Technical Work Groups
TWG members will be comprised of Commission members assigned to specific sector-based
TWGs. In addition, two members of the Commission’s Advisory Body will be assigned to each
TWG to provide non-Commission individuals with technical expertise and interest of importance
to the process. The TWGs will provide guidance to Commission members on decisions related to
milestones in the stepwise process. TWGs will also provide assistance to CCS in the
identification, design, and quantification of policy recommendations. Sector based TWGs
include:
!

Energy Supply (heat and power);

!

Residential, Commercial, Industrial (energy efficiency and conservation, and industrial
process);

!

Transportation and Land Use;

!

Agriculture, Forestry and Waste Management; and

!

Cross Cutting Issues (reporting, registries, public education, goals, etc.).

The TWGs will perform the following tasks in assistance to the Commission:
!

Review the catalog of existing, planned, and potential state actions and suggest additional
state-level actions for Commission consideration;

!

Suggest a list of initial priorities for analysis of policy actions for Commission consideration
through a balloting process;

!

Develop and suggest initial “straw proposals” for the design of individual policy actions
(with CCS assistance), including goals, timing, and coverage of parties for Commission
consideration;

!

Assist with the identification and development of data and assumptions to assist CCS with
analysis and quantification of individual policy actions for Commission consideration, as
needed;

!

Review proposals for the analysis and quantification of individual policy actions, including
data sources, methods and key assumptions for Commission consideration;

!

Respond to requests by the Commission for the development of alternative design scenarios
or analyses to address potential barriers to consensus;

!

Review draft final text for policy actions and final report language with suggested changes,
as needed, for consideration by the Commission; and

!

Assistance, as needed, with climate change science and impacts assessments and reviews as
they relate to the charge of the Commission.

CCS will provide a facilitation and technical analysis team to assist the TWGs and coordinate
Commission and TWG activities. CCS will also be responsible for drafting technical materials
on behalf of the TWGs and Commission.

B-14

Government Agencies
Ten state agencies will designate representatives to an advisory body established by the
Commission. Selected agencies may also provide staff to support TWG meetings and related
activities in support of the Commission and CCS team. This includes technical review and input
to TWG meetings. The Commission may also appoint agency representatives as TWG members.
The Public
The public is invited to attend Commission meetings and provide review and input to the
Commission and TWG members. Other public input mechanisms may be developed as needed
based on guidance from the Commission.
Participant Guidelines
Commission and TWG members are expected to follow certain codes of conduct during the
process, including:
!

Participants are expected to support the process and its concept fully and, through the group
process, in good faith directly collaborate toward the goals of the Commission and TWGs.

!

Participants are expected to act as equals during the process to ensure that all members have
equal footing during deliberations and decisions.

!

Participants must attend meetings and stay current with information provided to the group
and the decisions of the group.

!

Participants are asked not to reconsider decisions already made in the stepwise process. Once
the Commission reaches a milestone by vote, it moves to the next step.

!

Participants represent only themselves when making Commission decisions and/or speaking
about the process with the media or in other public settings.

! Participants should refrain from personal criticisms and provide objective, fact-based
comments and alternatives during Commission and TWG discussions.
Project Budget
CCS and the Commission have agreed upon a projected budget for the project. The estimated
CCS budget for completion of startup and completion of the Commission process covers the core
facilitation process and quantification of approximately 50 policy recommendations. Changes in
the number of meetings, number of policy options, or type of analysis may require additional
budget support.
Project Funding
CCS works with a group of private foundation donors to provide cost share to its state partners to
ensure a timely and successful launch and completion of the planning processes and other phases
of the project. Key donors have pledged support for the Commission, and the State of Arkansas
will also provide financial support to the project.

on Global Warming (GCGW) process to provide detailed documentation on emissions. The final
report, incorporating comments provided by the Technical Work Groups and approved by the
GCGW, is available at: http://www.arclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm.

D-1

Appendix E
Methods for Quantification
This appendix describes in brief the methods used in quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG)
emission reductions and direct costs/cost savings associated with the policy recommendations,
and provides examples of the distinction between “direct” and “indirect” costs. In addition, the
combined impacts of all of the policy recommendations within and between each sector were
estimated as if all of the recommendations were implemented together. This involved eliminating
any overlaps in coverage of affected entities that would occur to avoid double counting of
impacts. These quantification methods are based on those widely accepted among climate
change mitigation policy analysts. The following general methods were used as the starting
point, but were customized as needed to address the policy design features and specifications for
analysis of each policy, as approved by the Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global
Warming (GCGW):

Methods for Quantifying the Impacts of Policy Recommendations
!

Focus of Analysis: Net GHG reduction potential in physical units of million metric tons
(MMt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and net cost per metric ton reduced in units of
dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent ($/tCO2e). Where possible, full life cycle
analysis is used to evaluate the net energy (and emissions) performance of actions (taking
into account all energy inputs and outputs to production). Net analysis of the effects of
carbon sequestration is conducted where applicable.

!

Cost-Effectiveness: Because monetized dollar value of GHG reduction benefits are not
available, physical benefits are used instead, measured as dollars per MMtCO2e (cost or
savings per ton) or “cost effectiveness” evaluation. Both positive costs and cost savings
(negative costs) are estimated as a part of compliance cost.

!

Geographic Inclusion: Measure GHG impacts of activities that occur within the state,
regardless of the actual location of emissions reductions. For instance, a major benefit of
recycling is the reduction in material extraction and processing (e.g., aluminum production).
While a policy option may increase recycling in Arkansas, the reduction in emissions may
occur where this material is produced. Where significant emissions impacts are likely to
occur outside the state, this will be clearly indicated. These emissions reductions are counted
towards the achievement of the state’s emission goal, since they result from actions taken by
the state.

!

Direct vs. Indirect Effects: “Direct effects” are those borne by the entities implementing the
policy recommendation. For example, direct costs are net of any financial benefits or savings
to the entity. “Indirect effects” are defined as those borne by the entities other than those
implementing the policy recommendation. Indirect effects will be quantified on a case-bycase basis depending on magnitude, importance, time available, need and availability of data.
(See additional discussion and list of examples below.)

!

Non-GHG (External) Impacts and Costs: Include in qualitative terms where deemed
important. Quantify on a case-by-case basis as needed depending on need and where data are
readily available.
E-1

!

Discounting and Annualizing: Discount a multi-year stream of net costs (or savings) to
arrive at the “net present value cost” of the cost of implementing a policy option. Discount
costs in constant 2005 dollars using a 5% annual real discount rate for the project period of
2009 through 2025 (unless otherwise specified for the particular policy option). Capital
investments are represented in terms of annualized or amortized costs through 2025. Create
an annualized cost per ton by dividing the present value cost or cost savings by the
cumulative reduction in tons of GHG emissions.

!

Time Period of Analysis: Count the impacts of actions that occur during the project time
period and, using annualized emissions reduction and cost analysis, report emissions
reductions and costs for specific target years of 2015 and 2025. Where additional GHG
reductions or costs occur beyond the project period as a direct result of actions taken during
the project period, show these for comparison and potential inclusion.

!

Aggregation of Cumulative Impacts of Policy Recommendations: In addition to “stand
alone” results for individual options, estimate cumulative impacts of all options combined. In
this process we avoid simple double counting of GHG reduction potential and cost when
adding emission reductions and costs associated with all of the policy recommendations. To
do so we note and or estimate interactive effects between policy recommendations using
analytical methods where significant overlap or equilibrium effects are likely.
Documentation of how these overlaps were addressed is provided at the beginning of
Appendix G for the RCI sectors, Appendix I for the TLU sectors, and Appendix J for the
AFW sectors.

!

Policy Design Specifications and Other Key Assumptions: Include explicit notation of
timing, goal levels, implementing parties, the type of implementation mechanism, and other
key assumptions as determined by the GCGW.

!

Transparency: Include policy design choices (above) as well as data sources, methods, key
assumptions, and key uncertainties. Use data and comments provided by GCGW to ensure
best available data sources, methods, and key assumptions using their expertise and
knowledge to address specific issues in Arkansas. Modifications will be made through
facilitated decisions.

Board of the US EPA available at:

CC-1. Greenhouse Gas Inventories and Forecasts

Policy Description
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories and forecasts are essential for understanding the
magnitude of all emission sources and sinks (both man-made and natural), the relative
contribution of various types of emission sources and sinks to total emissions, and the factors
that affect trends over time. Inventories and forecasts help to inform state leaders and the public
on statewide trends, opportunities for mitigating emissions or enhancing sinks, and verifying
GHG reductions associated with implementation of the Governor’s Commission on Global
Warming’s (GCGW's) recommendations to the Governor.
Policy Design
Develop an inventory and forecast system that is aligned with national protocols and tailored to
specific emissions/sinks found in Arkansas.
Goals:
1. Coordinate with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on the development of a
mandatory federal GHG reporting rule (see Fiscal Year [FY] 2008 Consolidated
Appropriations Amendment). 1
a. This GHG rule will define sources, thresholds for reporting, and frequency of reporting,
and can be used to define reporting standards for the previous year’s emissions.
b. The rule will apply to the following gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.
c. Forecasting of GHG emissions will be included as part of the state’s responsibilities. In
forecasting future GHG emissions, treatment of uncertainties should be transparent, be as
consistent as possible across sectors and time, and to the extent possible, reflect multiple
scenarios.
2. Gather all inventory-related information for all historical years through 1990. Develop a
benchmark emissions estimate and associated gap analysis for all years, and identify missing
data and/or additional information required.
Timing:
Implement refinement of the GHG inventory for previous and current time periods, as needed, to
support implementation of the policy recommendations by the GCGW until the requirements of
the U.S. EPA reporting rule on GHG emission inventories and forecasts become clear.

General Emissions Breakdown
Anecdotally, it could be assumed that 1/3 of GHG emissions are from energy production sources,
1/3 are from mobile (transportation) sources, and 1/3 are from “other” (residential, commercial,
industrial, agricultural, forestry, etc).
Implementation Mechanisms
ADEQ already gathers information for many sectors included in the GHG inventory. The larger
Title V facilities submit data annually and should include the GHG pollutants as part of that
submittal. ADEQ develops data for smaller facilities and for other sectors, such as mobile
sources, every 3 years. The additional pollutants can be incorporated into this process.
Eventually, it may be appropriate to require certain sources to report their GHG emissions.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Federal Clean Air Act (CAA)
Per the CAA, for several years ADEQ has been developing emission inventories for pollutants
caused by stationary and mobile sources that contribute to the formation of the criteria air
pollutants (i.e., ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, fine particulate
matter, and lead) and regional haze. The pollutants that contribute to the formation of the criteria
air pollutants include CO, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), oxides
of sulfur (SOx), lead metal and lead oxides, and fine particulate matter. The pollutants that
contribute to the formation of regional haze include NOx, SOx, ammonia, VOC, fine particulate
matter, and elemental carbon. Certain sources are reported every year; other sources are reported
every 3 years. Currently, no GHGs are directly tracked or inventoried by ADEQ.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
This recommendation is an enabling policy to encourage management, tracking, and ultimately
reduction of GHG emissions. This recommendation does not directly reduce GHG emissions by
itself.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
This recommendation could be considered an administrative and enabling function and may
incur overhead costs. It will not directly reduce emissions per se, except where these data
motivate individual companies or sources to reduce emissions for public relations purposes.
Data Sources: Many.
Quantification Methods: Several.

F-3

Key Assumptions: Development of inventories and forecasts on an ongoing basis will establish
a baseline for GHG emissions and provide a monitoring tool for assessing the efficacy of the
GCGW’s recommendations. Effective emission sinks can be identified and augmented. Public
education and outreach will inform and involve citizens in the overall goal of GHG emission
reductions. Forecasting will allow state officials to plan for, implement, and monitor necessary
additions of emission sources or sinks to the emission cycle.
Key Uncertainties
!

The adequacy of ongoing funding for a statewide GHG inventory and forecasting function.

!

Appropriate resources to effectively integrate existing data into a central reporting system.

!

The most effective frequency of reporting.

Additional Benefits and Costs
The preparation of periodic inventories and forecasts would most likely require additional
resources. These resources are minimized but not eliminated by adding implementation of this
recommendation to the existing emission inventory duties currently assigned to ADEQ.
Experience with GHG reduction efforts indicates that reporting entities are likely to realize cost
savings as they begin to focus on ways to reduce energy use and emissions. Periodic public
disclosure of GHG emission source and sink data in Arkansas may help to educate the public on
opportunities for reducing GHG emissions and increasing carbon sequestration.
Feasibility Issues
!

Incorporating the reporting and forecasting efforts into existing workload demands.

!

Gathering the required data in a timely and consistent manner.

!

Maintaining the skills and expertise to accurately forecast based on trends.

CC-2. State Greenhouse Gas Reporting and Registry

Policy Description
Greenhouse gas reporting reflects the measurement and reporting of GHG emissions to support
both goal development and tracking and management of emissions. GHG reporting can help
sources identify emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks, and potentially develop revenue
associated with possible future GHG mandates by developing the required infrastructure in
advance. Tracking and reporting of GHG emissions can also help in the implementation of
periodic state GHG inventories. GHG reporting is a precursor for sources to participate in GHG
reduction programs, opportunities for recognition, and a GHG emission reduction registry, as
well as to secure “baseline protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions).
A GHG registry enables recording of GHG emission reductions in a central repository with
“transaction ledger” capacity to support tracking, management, and “ownership” of emission
reductions; establish baseline protection; enable recognition of environmental leadership; and/or
provide a mechanism for regional, multistate, and cross-border cooperation. Properly designed
registry structures also provide a foundation for possible future trading programs.
Policy Design
The reporting and registry functions go hand-in-hand. The reporting protocol and format must be
aligned with the requirements of the registry provider. To be effective, the registry must be
applied on a national level, with an international registry being preferred.
Goals: Encourage participation in a nationally recognized, voluntary reporting and registry
program. Pay supplemental attention to protocol development for any particular sources or
sinks/offsets that are specific to Arkansas. Strive to avoid duplication of reporting requirements
on emission sources. Rely on the use of data that emission sources already report under existing
and future state and federal programs to avoid duplication of reporting burden on the sources.
State of Arkansas
Participate in a reporting and registry program to develop knowledge on the reporting
mechanism, reporting costs, registry requirements, and resource demands. Educate other private
and public organizations on the requirements of participation.
Other Organizations
Facilitate and encourage voluntary participation in a reporting and a registry program.
Acknowledge or provide incentives for local governments, academic and nonprofit institutions,
and businesses and regulated industries.
Timing:
! Address state participation as quickly as possible.
!

Develop a plan for encouraging organizations to participate in a reporting and registry
program concurrent to the state’s participation in a program.

Parties Involved:
! Arkansas state agencies (lead by example).
!

!

All GHG emission sources and sinks (both man-made and natural) should be included.

Implementation Mechanisms
The Climate Registry is a nonprofit partnership of states developing consistent, accurate, and
transparent GHG emissions measurement protocols capable of supporting voluntary and
mandatory GHG emission reporting policies for its members and reporting entities. Currently 39
U.S. states are members (www.theclimateregistry.org). The State of Arkansas should (1) join
The Climate Registry as a board member for the benefit of sources in the state, and (2) itself
become a reporter to The Climate Registry by requiring all state agencies to report GHG
emissions through The Climate Registry. All “direct” emissions (Scope 1 emissions as defined
by the GHG Protocol) and emissions associated with purchased power and heat (Scope 2
emissions) should be reported. Other indirect emissions (Scope 3 emissions) should be phased in
over a period of 2 years after the start of the initial reporting effort. Direct and indirect reporting
costs as well as results by agency should be presented in a public report. The reports associated
with following years should include reference to previous year’s performance for tracking of
performance.
The state should also provide reporting education and assistance for private entities to encourage
their participation in The Climate Registry.
If and when a federal registry and reporting program is implemented, Arkansas will adjust its
program as appropriate to align itself with the approved federal program.

The reporting and registry components of this policy recommendation would help position
Arkansas entities for participation in an emission trading program should one develop in the
future, leading to cost savings. Although establishment of a credible reporting program is
essential for participating in a trading program, these elements do not reduce GHG emissions
themselves. This recommendation could be considered an administrative and enabling function;
it does not directly reduce GHG emissions by itself.

CC-3. Statewide Greenhouse Gas Reduction Goals or Targets

Policy Description
Section 5 (Purpose and duties) of Arkansas Act 696 requires the GCGW to set forth a global
warming pollutant reduction goal based on the commission’s evaluation of the current global
warming data, the assessment of global warming mitigation strategies, and the available global
warming pollutant reduction strategies. 2 Consistent with this charge, the establishment of a
statewide goal or target can provide vision and direction, a framework within which
implementation of GCGW policy recommendations can proceed effectively, and a basis of
comparison for periodic assessments of progress. Greenhouse gas reduction goals or targets
recommended by the GCGW should be consistent with the parallel goal of an efficient, robust
Arkansas economy. In pursuit of similar climate progress, at least 18 other states have
established GHG reduction goals or targets.
Policy Design
Goals: The GCGW recommends that Arkansas establish a statewide, economy-wide goal to
reduce the state’s gross GHG emissions below 2000 levels by 20% by 2020, 35% by 2025, and
50% by 2035.
Timing: These goals should be adopted by the state by 2009.
Parties Involved: All parties statewide.
Implementation Mechanisms
The Arkansas Climate Change Center should prepare a report to the Governor and the State
Legislature once every 2 years on the state’s progress toward achieving the statewide GHG
reduction goal in coordination with ADEQ and other state agencies as appropriate. This report
should address each sector’s progress toward reducing GHG emissions, identify the contribution
of each sector’s emissions (identified in the GHG inventory and forecast report) toward
achieving the statewide goal, and identify future actions and resource needs.
Until the Climate Change Center is established, the state will decide on the appropriate lead
agency or agencies for implementing this policy.

CC-4. The State’s Own Greenhouse Gas Emissions (Lead by Example)

Policy Description
State and local government entities are responsible for providing a multitude of public services
that are delivered through very diverse operations and result in wide-ranging GHG emission
production activities. Because of this role, they have the opportunity to model a diverse array of
GHG emission reduction activities for a wide variety of clients. State and local government
entities should take the lead in demonstrating that reductions in GHG emissions can be achieved
by analyzing current operations, identifying significant GHG sources, and implementing changes
in technology, procedures, behavior, operations, and services provided.
State government can also encourage and/or provide incentives to reduce GHG emissions by
others in a variety of ways. One of the most important is to link GHG reductions to energy
expenditures, and demonstrate that reduction in one leads to reduction in the other.
Policy Design
The GCGW recommends that Arkansas establish GHG reduction targets for state and local
government operations and school districts, with an emphasis on energy efficiency for both
transportation and nontransportation uses. The establishment of these targets will be helpful in
setting an example for nongovernmental entities and will help agencies to focus on doing the
necessary analysis. Reductions should be reported at the agency level. Thus, state and local
government agencies or departments would first need to develop agency- or department-specific
GHG emissions inventory data, ideally building on existing energy use reporting data. This
would become the baseline data for ongoing emission reduction activities and measurement,
which could be included in annual reporting for all entities. Agency and/or department reports
would be aggregated into a summary report reflecting state GHG emissions. The Arkansas
Climate Change Center should oversee the ongoing climate efforts of the government’s agencies
or departments, review their performance, and provide direction, guidance, resources, shared
approaches, and recognition to agencies or departments and their employees that are working to
reduce the government’s GHG emissions.
Goals:
! Reduce GHG emissions from Arkansas state and local operations (including universities)
consistent with the GHG emission reduction levels that the GCGW recommends for
statewide GHG reduction goals or targets.
!

Require all state and local agencies and school districts to make continual progress toward
the goal, regardless of their starting point.

Timing: The state’s efforts to "lead by example" in reducing its own GHG emissions should
start immediately. The first annual report by agencies should be due by June 2010 or sooner. The
second annual report should reflect initial progress in reducing GHG emissions as agencies begin
to plan and implement operational changes.

F-10

Parties Involved: Coverage should include all operations of all state agencies including
universities, authorities, quasi-state entities, local governments, and school districts.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

The Arkansas Climate Change Center is charged with collecting energy use and cost data
from state and local agencies (including state-supported institutions of higher education) and
public school systems. Until the Climate Change Center is established, the state will decide
on the appropriate lead agency or agencies for implementing this policy.

!

To allow for sharing of information and success stories, the Arkansas Climate Change Center
will convene a meeting of agency representatives annually or biennially. This meeting will
facilitate education and outreach to agencies and employees, and will allow for recognition of
agency progress.

!

The state will evaluate development of state contracts for the procurement of low-GHG
products.

!

All state agencies should consider GHG emissions in their evaluations of environmental
assessments and environmental impact statements and similar environmental studies. State
agencies should consider life-cycle GHG emissions as they design and perform their day-today functions and services—for example, ADEQ in considering environmental assessments
and environmental impact statements, the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) in
considering energy projects, the Arkansas Department of Transportation in considering
transportation projects, etc. Even without authority to control or reduce GHG emissions,
raising them for examination will help increase awareness and perhaps consideration of
lower-GHG alternatives.

!

In the future, the state should consider climate-neutral bonding (i.e., no net increase in GHG
emissions within the bond-issuing agency’s geographical jurisdiction after the project
becomes operational).

CC-5. Comprehensive Local Government Climate Action Plans

Policy Description
“Think globally, act locally” is the refrain often heard to bring action to bear on environmental
issues within the average individual’s ability. Similarly, local government actions on climate
change issues will be a keystone for achieving state and federal climate action goals. There is no
single approach that can be universally applied at the local level; however, local communities are
often the incubator for new approaches that can be further developed and applied on a larger
level. Local governments will report on progress on climate change issues and will provide
innovative, multi-sector solutions that will be shared with others through a clearinghouse or other
mechanisms. The state will provide encouragement and assistance to local jurisdictions to sustain
global warming objectives.
Policy Design
Local climate planning initiatives will address local mitigation opportunities, which may change
over time. Existing, regional planning data will be used to develop climate change baselines for
various, high-value-GHG sectors (transportation, energy use, waste generation, etc.) and to
forecast changes or reversals in future growth. The local jurisdictions periodically will report
their progress to the state on reducing global warming impacts, so a comprehensive baseline is
important when setting GHG targets, developing long-term sustainability plans and local
adaptation measures, and requesting resources.
Local governments have many approaches and motives for reducing GHG emissions.
Jurisdictions participating in reducing global warming pollution more often than not are
motivated by the desire to simply cut traffic, save tax money, clean the air, and improve the
quality of life in their communities. Local governments may develop collaborative agreements
with organizations that advocate for a specific approach in order to simplify access to
mechanisms for achieving results.
Goals:
Beginning in 2009, the state will provide resources and materials to educate community planning
and zoning officials about climate change, impacts, and opportunities. Regional meetings will be
conducted to train local officials, discuss the state’s global warming program, and review other
jurisdictions' approaches and lessons learned, to emphasize assistance and resources and to
underscore the value of collaboration. These meetings will be repeated periodically to:
!

Identify individual community leaders who are acting effectively on climate change, and
showcase and share their successes. Likewise, individual community leaders who are not yet
acting on climate change should be encouraged to apply lessons learned. The state will host
events periodically that focus on leading by example, sharing specifics on lessons learned
and opportunities, and illustrating financial investments and payback, co-benefits, etc.

F-13

!

Identify, assist, and leverage community-based organizations that have expertise or interest
in climate-related issues. Work with community-based organizations to identify and build
upon climate issues related to their core mission.

!

Support and facilitate outreach and education within community-based organizations
regarding climate change issues and actions. Establish a network of community-based
organizations acting on climate change so they can collaborate, organize joint events, etc.

!

Engage communities and students around university campuses to lead periodic meetings to
reach out on climate change and discuss impacts, sector-specific mitigation actions, and
adaptation opportunities.

!

Sponsor university research on local government climate change initiatives, and periodically
provide detailed information to the media about the outcome, benefits, etc.

!

Encourage local communities to consider including the GCGW recommendations in their
local action plans.

Timing: In FY 2009, identify local government leaders and model municipalities.
Parties Involved: Institutions, municipalities, service clubs, social and affinity groups,
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs,) etc. Recognize leadership, share success stories and
role models, and expand involvement and participation within civic society.
Implementation Mechanisms
Local governments across the United States are implementing energy efficiency and renewable
energy actions that can have multiple benefits, including saving money, creating jobs, promoting
sustainable growth, and reducing emissions of GHGs and other air pollutants. Organizations are
focusing on global warming issues and local municipality action.
Local jurisdictions should be encouraged to collaborate with global warming projects with other
municipalities in their region (including those out-of-state). Regional climate change initiatives
may be more efficient than state-level programs, as they often eliminate duplication of work and
benefit from economies of scale. For example, regional initiatives have begun developing
systems that reduce CO2 emissions from power plants, increase renewable energy generation,
track renewable energy credits, and research and establish baselines for carbon sequestration.
Local Arkansas jurisdictions will choose specific climate change actions that bring the quickest
return on investment and serve their populations the most. Local jurisdictions can use specific
best practice actions for stand-alone programs or as part of a regional climate action plan to
reduce GHG emissions. Best practices (such as the California Best Practices Framework 3 ) offer
a variety of options ranging from simple steps to more complex undertakings for city and county
agencies. Best practices are available for a broad range of climate change actions relating to
energy conservation, community design and land use, transportation, renewable energy, waste
reductions, purchasing, etc.

Locally designed initiatives can provide an effective and cost-efficient way to achieve local,
national, and global sustainability objectives. Local Governments for Sustainability (formerly the
International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives [ICLEI]) provides technical consulting,
training, and information services to build capacity, share knowledge, and support local
governments in their implementation of programs to reduce pollution that causes global warming
and in turn, reduce traffic, save money, and improve their communities' quality of life. Municipal
leaders should be encouraged to join ICLEI’s Cities for Climate Protection program and/or the
U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement.

Eureka Springs, Fayetteville, Little Rock, and North Little Rock have signed the U.S. Mayors
Climate Protection Agreement, and Fayetteville, Little Rock, and North Little Rock have joined
the Cool Cities program. 4,5 These jurisdictions may already be taking action to reduce GHG
emissions, and may have already embarked on their own reporting plans.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
This recommendation is an enabling policy to encourage local governments to develop and
implement climate action plans to reduce GHG emissions. It does not directly reduce GHG
emissions by itself.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings

Key Uncertainties
!

The adequacy of ongoing funding for the state to assist local governments in developing
plans.

!

The availability of resources and expertise to local governments to develop and implement
their plans.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Development and implementation of local plans will help the state to achieve its statewide GHG
emission reduction goals. If local governments include energy efficiency and renewable and
clean energy actions in their plans, these actions have multiple benefits, including saving money,
creating jobs, promoting sustainable growth, and reducing emissions of GHGs and other air
pollutants.

CC-6. State Climate Public Education and Outreach

Policy Description
The key for long-term success of Arkansas’ strategies for addressing climate change lies with
increasing the awareness of the issue, as well as the societal costs of and benefits from adopting
new policies and/or goals. Education of Arkansas’ citizens, business leaders, and policymakers is
integral to the successful implementation of changes to mitigate the effects of climate change on
the state's environment, economy, and lifestyle. Outreach will extend Arkansans’ personal and
cooperative commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change to all sectors of endeavor as
well as to future generations.
Policy Design
Climate literacy education and outreach would utilize the same practices as existing ADEQ
practices. ADEQ has an established network for education and outreach for issues similar to
climate literacy (e.g., pollution prevention, clean air). The education and outreach program
would include aspects of global warming actions developed from other sectors (i.e., forestry,
energy supply, agriculture). Collaboration with NGOs will facilitate public education and
outreach and ensure that climate education is coordinated enough to be broadly effective.
The state will provide education and outreach funding for public information messages in the
various media regarding Arkansas’ climate literacy. Other incentives may include educational
materials developed for K-12, university-level syllabi, and preferences in contracting for
businesses that employ global warming mitigation practices and/or products. The target
audiences will be evaluated periodically to determine the extent of knowledge and the efficacy of
global warming outreach efforts.
Goals:
The GCGW recommends that this policy address, at a minimum, the following target audiences:
Target Audience: State Executive Agencies
The Governor should form a climate literacy education and outreach committee (coordinated by
ADEQ) to educate the public and other audiences regarding the state’s climate change action
plan and associated policies, and to oversee outreach activities. The committee should consist of
appointed members and should be supported by outreach coordinators from relevant state
agencies (energy supply, forestry, agriculture, etc.). The committee should:
!

Work with the Governor’s Office and state agencies to ensure a coordinated effort to
implement an effective program that is consistent with the review of climate literacy
programs, curricula, and courses.

!

Create and maintain one or more “outreach coordinator” positions in relevant executive
agencies, specifically tasked with climate change issues.

!

Assess the level (establish a baseline) of public understanding of the impacts of climate
change and variability of (proposed) state-specific actions to deal with global warming.
F-17

!

Establish a recurring awards program to recognize leadership and attainment of the goals and
objectives of the Arkansas global warming action plan.

Target Audience: General Public
Increase awareness and engage in climate change actions in personal and professional lives.
!

Educate broadcasters, reporters, editorial boards, etc., about climate change and the risks it
imposes, and provide a subset of solutions. Work with state broadcasters and print media
associations to develop and run climate change public service announcements.

!

Develop and maintain a state climate change Web site for the public, including a
clearinghouse of Arkansas-specific climate change information and resources.

!

Work with existing business outreach efforts to customers to enhance awareness of climate
change issues and opportunities.

!

Provide—and advertise—marketplace incentives to adopt and purchase goods with the
minimum carbon “footprint.”

Target Audience: Future Generations
Integrate climate change into educational curricula, post-secondary degree programs, and
professional licensing to address the multidisciplinary approach to reduce adverse climate
change effects.
!

Ensure climate change public education (K-12) performance standards for science and social
studies; identify gaps in climate change education and develop specific curricula to fill any
gaps. 6,7,8,9

!

Integrate “best practices” into public school design and construction, and use this as a means
to educate the public about to educate students (and parents) firsthand in their communities
and colleges.

!

Organize groups of educators to identify, assemble, and employ climate change curricula
appropriate to age groups. Make curricula and associated materials available to nonpublicfunded educational courses.

!

Integrate climate change into core college curricula, and promote research into climate
change and solutions at state universities; develop university “Centers of Excellence” on
climate issues, new approaches, and technologies.

!

Develop assessment tools to determine the impact of climate change curricula.

CC-7. Optimizing Best Scale of Reduction Policies

Policy Description
The Arkansas Climate Change Center should investigate optimization of scale for each specific
GHG reduction considered by the state and report its findings in its annual reports. These
investigations should include interstate and regional opportunities that optimize GHG reductions.
Policy Design
Goals: To guide the Arkansas Climate Change Center investigations, “optimization” should be
interpreted as opportunities that further increase the state’s overall reduction goals by at least 1%
per year, or accelerate the achievement of certain goals by at least one year.
Timing: As noted above.
Parties Involved: As noted above.
Implementation Mechanisms
Until the Arkansas Climate Change Center is established, the state will decide on the appropriate
lead agency or agencies for implementing this policy.

CC-8. Creative Financial Mechanisms

Policy Description
Allocation of some resources under existing state programs and initiatives can be targeted to
achieving state climate goals. However, it is likely that additional resources may also be needed
to implement the recommendations in the state plan. Therefore, the state and others will need to
consider seeking and stimulating additional funding and investment in climate solutions
identified in the state plan. Initiatives could include (but not limited to) establishing, promoting,
and utilizing creative financing mechanisms for projects and products that reduce GHGs.
Examples could include establishment of a State Revolving Loan Fund to finance products and
services with low-carbon intensity, promotion of the use of “green products” procurement
preferences, and establishment and promotion of greener buying cooperatives.
Policy Design
Goals: The state should establish a board to identify and procure funding from a broad range of
sources to support implementation of this policy recommendation. The state should survey
options within existing state economic development plans appropriate to support GHG
mitigation polices within Arkansas. Until the Arkansas Climate Change Center is established, the
state will decide on the appropriate lead agency or agencies for implementing this policy.
Timing: Establish funding by mid-2009.
Parties Involved: Arkansas Climate Change Center, state agencies, EPA, foundations, trusts,
NGOs, companies, Arkansas Development Finance Authority.
Implementation Mechanisms
A State Revolving Loan Fund could be established to help offset costs to individuals, companies,
etc., for projects that aim to reduce GHG levels through developing new technologies or
implementing efficiency strategies/programs. A number of these types of programs already exist
in the state, but are focused in particular areas or programs like water allocation, for example.
Additional options should include the compiling of funding programs that could have the
potential for financial assistance, such as foundations, nonprofits, trusts, etc. An examination of
other potential revenue sources from some tax base should also be considered. The idea of
“creative” funding sources should be diverse and not limited to just one potential source in an
effort to put as many options as possible on the table. It is foreseeable that these programs could
be managed in coordination with the Arkansas Climate Change Center and state agencies.
Examples of possible funding instruments and activities include the following:
!

Establish a State Revolving Loan Program by mid-2009 focused on reducing GHGs in
Arkansas.

!

Pursue potential tax options that would help fund the GCGW's recommendations.

!

Establish a database of potential funders interested in or having a record of funding
environmental projects, like foundations or organizations.
F-23

!

Pursue the potential for ballot initiatives, such as impact fees.

!

Examine state incentive opportunities that might include tax credits.

!

Establish innovative financing programs for residential and commercial ratepayers to more
reasonably finance the up-front capital costs of adding efficiency improvements and
renewable energy systems to their homes and small- and medium-size businesses and
companies (refer to the U.S. Business Small Administration guidance for defining the size of
businesses and companies).

CC-9. Adaptation and Vulnerability

Policy Description
The Governor’s Office should seek government and private funding to help secure efforts for
long time monitoring of climate change in the state. A climate change analysis center (i.e.,
Arkansas Climate Change Center) for the collection and analysis of this data should be
established using these funds.
Along with tracking the climate change data, Arkansas should encourage the development of a
plan to manage the projected impacts of climate change on the state and to reduce the state’s
contribution to GHGs. The state should work with industries and research universities to create
an Arkansas Climate Change Center. The establishment of the Center should attract more
researchers and scientists to the state to help stimulate industrial partners for new economic
development and to create new “green” jobs for the state’s citizens.
Along with existing local, state, and federal agencies, the Arkansas Climate Change Center may
help to address the impact of climate change. The impact issues would include identifying the
climate change risks to: humans (e.g., factors that could contribute to disease); water resources
(e.g., risk factors that could cause flooding, drought, pollution of waterways); temperaturesensitive populations (e.g., factors that could place immunocompromised individuals at even
greater health risks); and ecosystems (e.g., animals and plants that may be affected by changes in
their environment). Along with these adverse changes in the natural environment, climate change
could also harm Arkansas' energy, transportation, and communication systems; vital
infrastructure (including public facilities); and entire economy. The analysis of these risks along
with occurring climate change data can be used to create a model to project future problems and
hopefully develop solutions to address these issues.
Coordinated responses to climate change issues should be put into effect through the appropriate
local, state, and federal agencies to address encountered problems.
Policy Design
Goals and Timing:
As soon as possible, the Governor’s Office will:
!

Encourage grant writing with goals to acquire funds to establish an Arkansas Climate Change
Center.

!

Develop an Arkansas Climate Change Center, joining industry and research universities,
which will continually work toward solutions for climate impact issues.

!

Have established agencies in place to address climate change impact issues that will be
constantly occurring.

F-25

!

Have the Climate Change Center in place to record and analyze climate data that can be
shared with other states and regions and used to create models to project detrimental climate
change issues and to broadcast these projections in advance.

!

The Arkansas Climate Change Center should work with the Parties Involved, listed below, to
monitor data and analyses and address arising climate change issues.

Parties Involved: Arkansas Department of Natural Resources, National/State Weather
Forecasters, Arkansas Department of Forestry, Arkansas Department of Energy, Arkansas
Department of Transportation, Arkansas Department of Agriculture, Arkansas Department of
Economic Development, Ducks Unlimited, Audubon Society, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,
Centers for Disease Control, the State University Systems, National Institutes of Health, National
Science Foundation, NGOs,, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and U.S. EPA.
Implementation Mechanisms
To be addressed by the Governor’s Office.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Federal and state agencies, such as U.S. EPA, national and state weather forecasting agencies,
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, etc., have been
in place to address various environmental issues and emergencies that may arise that may or may
not be covered by this policy recommendation.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Not applicable.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
Not applicable.
Data Sources: Reports from various “parties involved,” such as reports from national weather
forecasters, the Centers for Disease Control, U.S. EPA, etc.
Quantification Methods: The Arkansas Climate Change Center will acquire quantitative
reports from the federal and state agencies mentioned and organize these into a complete report
that would present a broad, overall analysis of the environmental impacts.
Key Assumptions: National and regional agencies will be in place to share data and be involved
in national and regional analyses and modeling of future impacts.
Key Uncertainties
!

The acceptance of the federal government to approve CO2 and other GHGs as pollutants, and
to set regulations for controlling these pollutants.

!

The uncertainty of the ultimate impact of GHGs on the state/national/global environment.

!

The willingness of regional acceptance and participation in joint programs to help address the
issues.
F-26

Additional Benefits and Costs
!

Benefits would include:
Produce more “green” jobs for the state;
! Raise public awareness so that citizens can understand the environmental, economic, and
social impacts of GHG emissions and to reduce these levels on an individual level;
! Create a healthier environment by reducing GHGs; and
! Have emergency plans in place to address issues that may arise from drastic
environmental changes.
!

!

An additional cost may be if the Arkansas Climate Change Center fails from lack of funding,
and the impact of this loss falls back onto the previously existing state/federal agencies.

Feasibility Issues
The success of this policy will depend upon the federal acceptance of GHGs as pollutants and the
funding from the various proposed granting institutes.

CC-10. Climate Change-Related Economic Development

Policy Description
Successful state GHG mitigation efforts are highly dependent on active participation of the
business community, particularly in the energy, agriculture, transportation, development, and
manufacturing sectors. The intent of this policy is to encourage and facilitate the involvement of
funding and investment sources, business interests, and entrepreneurs in pursuing business
opportunities associated with GHG mitigation and global warming solutions as quickly and as
significantly as possible. The creation of a clearinghouse-like entity may make it possible to
match technology developers and other climate solution entrepreneurs with necessary financing
more effectively and expeditiously. As a result, a state’s ability to identify and secure early
business opportunities associated with climate change may be enhanced, increasing its global
competitive advantage and job creation within the state.
Potential funding sources include philanthropic organizations, high-net-worth individuals, or
others interested in supporting innovative, environmentally effective market solutions.
Recognizing that fortunes are likely to be made in the “new energy economy,” for-profit
investors, pension funds, mutual funds, and/or venture capitalists may be looking to fund similar
business opportunities. Although technology entrepreneurs are often cited as offering potential
global warming solutions, equally progressive solutions may lie in the fields of law, accounting,
marketing, production, and government relations and lobbying. The objective of this policy
recommendation is to leverage a state’s specific talents for global warming solutions into
securing the business opportunities and market advantages that well-supported “early-bird”
efforts are likely to reap in a carbon-constrained world.
Policy Design
In a continuing effort to reshape economic development in Arkansas, the recognized weaknesses
in 20th-century models challenge new directions to incorporate broadened and dynamic global
opportunities into the way state economies welcome sustainable and efficient production and
creative activities that include reduced GHG levels. Accelerate Arkansas
(http://www.acceleratearkansas.com/) has recently cited the importance of educational and
community development to ensure effective economic development that grows beyond the
dominance of conventional manufacturing recruitment.
Goals:
! Design a mechanism to evaluate and monitor programs, missions, and agencies responding to
changing trends in economic development as linked with GHG mitigation, whenever
possible.
!

Conduct an in-depth analysis of the structure and organization of development activities by
state government agencies, commissions, and other organizations, to encourage and
transition the variety of state and local public, private, and nonprofit organizations into a
structure that is in lock-step with necessary review processes and renewal cycles, enabling
GHG mitigation and development renovations wherever possible.

F-28

!

Consider economic development with greater emphasis on what works “sustainably” for
Arkansas and regional communities to establish GHG mitigation as a means toward
entrepreneurship and building a culture of continuous innovation and reconsideration.

!

Leverage the state’s job creation and investment incentives into securing business and
education opportunities that focus on improving economic development with GHG
mitigation.

!

Identify likely funding mechanisms and policy tools that not only provide economic
development and recruitment stimulus for new industries and businesses that feature GHG
mitigation actions, but also highlight benefiting infrastructure as it exists or is planned for
Arkansas through implementing parties in support of renewable energy production.

Timing: Basic seed money should be allocated by the end of the 2009 legislative session.
Parties Involved: Arkansas Economic Developers, Arkansas Economic Development
Commission, 10 Arkansas State Chamber of Commerce/Associated Industries of Arkansas,
Accelerate Arkansas, Arkansas Development Finance Authority, Arkansas Science and
Technology Authority, Arkansas Department of Workforce Education, the state’s University
Centers for Business and Economic Research (e.g., University of Arkansas at Little Rock Small
Business Development Center and Institute of Economic Advancement, University of Arkansas
Fayetteville Center for Business and Economic Research, Arkansas State University Delta
Center for Economic Development), Arkansas Assistance Procurement Center, University of
Arkansas Cooperative Extension Service, Capital Access Arkansas, and the Office of State
Procurement.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Design and adapt a performance-based strategic management system such as a balanced
scorecard.

!

Incorporate metrics associated with predictions of GHG mitigation relationships that exist
between ongoing actions and potential or targeted results.
Both design of those metrics and adaptation should be appropriately deduced or adjusted
to improve accuracy, provide utility in decision making, and facilitate communication
– Tracking could be charged to the Arkansas Climate Change Center
– Standardized or benchmarked against performance across agencies, businesses, and
communities
Promote Arkansas’ use of a strategic management system in economic development through
existing public relation efforts that promotes the state’s natural resources, such that value is
publicized linking GHG mitigation (i.e., tourism, transportation, quality of life)

CC-11. Regulatory Realignment in Government To Encourage Constructive
Climate Action

Policy Description
State government agencies can lead by example in efforts to control GHG emissions by ensuring
that their policies and regulations are climate-friendly. Each state agency should conduct a
review of its policies and regulations to identify opportunities for realigning them to remove
impediments to climate-friendly options. In addition, agencies should identify opportunities to
utilize incentives to minimize the carbon footprint of state government as well as entities affected
by state government regulations and policies (e.g., local governments and the private sector).
Examples may include (but are not limited to) coordination and alignment between state
agencies’ policies and programs, reduced costs and/or time frames for greener permits,
“performance-based” regulations, and reducing or eliminating “throughput incentives” so that
regulated utilities are compensated for demand-side reductions, not just supply-side activities.
Policy Design
Lead by example is one way to help spur activities that will ultimately decrease state agencies'
GHG emissions. A multisector energy audit will help the state gain an understanding of where
agencies currently stand on energy use, GHG emissions, and consumption. Once baseline data
are collected, recommended goals should be set for reducing GHG emissions and increasing
efficiency in state government. In addition, the Arkansas Climate Change Center should examine
policies that block opportunities for reducing GHG emissions in Arkansas. In coordination with
other programs being recommended by the GCGW, establishing a demand-side reduction credit
could be initiated to encourage energy consumption reductions.
Goals:
The state should amend the definition of “air contaminant” in Chapter 2 of the Arkansas Air
Pollution Control Code (Regulation 18) to remove any barriers that prevent it from controlling
CO2 emissions. 14 This will enable Arkansas to mitigate CO2, as well as to effectively coordinate
its GHG mitigation policies and programs with future regional and national policies and
programs. The legislature and governor should coordinate with ADEQ in formulating an
amendment to the definition of “air contaminant” to avoid regulating small sources of CO2.
The state should lead by example by implementing the following actions to mitigate its own
GHG emissions:
!

Examine state facilities and practices concerning GHG emissions.

!

Conduct multisector energy audits of all state facilities.

!

Set GHG reduction targets and standards for state government.

14

See Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission. "Chapter 2: Definitions." In Arkansas Air Pollution
Control Code—Regulation 18 (http://www.adeq.state.ar.us/regs/files/reg18_final_990215.pdf): “Air contaminant”
means any solid, liquid, gas, or vapor or any combination thereof. The following shall not be considered air
contaminants: water vapor, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, and inert gases.
F-32

!

Examine any policy barriers that are currently in place.

!

Develop a process for tracking and reporting on annual progress.

!

Establish demand-side reduction credits for regulated utilities.

Timing: Statewide program in place within 15 months of adoption.
Parties Involved: State agencies, research entities, Arkansas Climate Change Center,
universities, NGOs.
Implementation Mechanisms
State Audits
[Note: The following language is also included in RCI-3a (Reduced Energy Use in New and
Retrofitted State-Owned Buildings) and RCI-3b (Reduced Energy Use in State-Owned
Buildings).]
Audits of energy use and associated GHG emissions by state agencies are vital for establishing
baseline levels needed to set achievable goals for reducing emissions. It will be important to
audit both state agency facilities and activities in order to fully assess and mitigate each agency’s
carbon footprint. It will also be important for state agencies to audit energy use and GHG
emissions annually for tracking progress toward meeting GHG reduction goals. In so doing, the
GCGW recommends that state agencies consider a phased approach by assessing energy use and
associated emissions for state facilities and then for state activities.
!

State Facilities—Since facilities are stable and stationary entities, protocols for auditing
energy use and emissions should be fairly routine to implement annually, and would assist
the agencies in developing experience that can be applied to assess energy use associated
with their activities.

!

State Activities—Development and implementation of protocols to assess energy use and
emissions associated with state agency activities may be more difficult, because activities
vary, depending on the mission of each agency, and are likely to change frequently, even
within an agency. Nevertheless, an analysis of energy use and emissions associated with
agency activities is necessary to develop plans to mitigate GHG emissions and demonstrate
progress toward meeting GHG emission reduction goals.

In addition, the state should consider a phased approach, starting with the larger state
government agencies first, to develop protocols and experience that can then be used to assist
smaller agencies and the university system. Such an approach should be designed to leverage
experience and assessment tools that can be used by other entities (e.g., school districts) to foster
consistency in developing and implementing audit protocols on a routine basis.
The Arkansas Climate Change Center is charged with implementing this policy recommendation.
Until the Climate Change Center is established, the state will decide on the appropriate lead
agency or agencies for implementing this policy.

F-33

Merchant Plants
In order for Arkansas to have more control over its GHG reduction, this policy recommends the
removal of the 1999 exemption of Merchant Power Plants from the standard APSC process.
Currently, Merchant Plants (Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs)) can build where ever they
want as long as they meet the requirements of the ADEQ, U.S. Corps of Engineers (Wetlands),
and EPA (Clean Air Act), which at present do nothing to address GHG emissions in the State.
Unlike "rate-based" plants -- which put ratepayers at risk -- there is no requirement for merchant
plants to substantiate that a public need exists for the electricity that they propose to generate and
sell. This is because they are built with investors' money rather than ratepayers' money. This
exemption from APSC oversight allows merchant plants to sell their power to anyone, anywhere.
They can sell any or all their output to out-of-state entities, which means Arkansas experiences
the brunt of any emissions consequences -- both of GHGs and unhealthy air pollutants -- but
little to none of the energy benefit. Additionally, merchant plants tie up existing grid capacity
that could otherwise be used to benefit Arkansas consumers, including development of
renewable energy sources. This recommendation would remove the 1999 exemption. In addition,
the legislature and governor should review and enact clarifying statutes governing environmental
considerations for all power plants in Arkansas including ADEQ, APSC, and other state
agencies. The legislature and governor should also review and consider removing incentives for
merchant plants to locate in the state (e.g., Act 9 Bonds). 15

Overlap Discussion
The Governor's Commission on Global Warming (GCGW) and the Residential, Commercial,
and Industrial (RCI) Technical Work Group (TWG) have developed 10 policy recommendations
to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the RCI sector. In addition to estimating
the impacts of each individual policy recommendation, the combined impacts of the policy
recommendations in each sector were estimated, assuming that all were implemented together.
This involved eliminating any overlaps in coverage that would occur to avoid double counting of
impacts. Also, some of the policy recommendations in one sector overlapped with those in
another sector; therefore, these overlaps were identified, and the impact analysis was adjusted to
eliminate double counting of impacts associated with these intersectoral overlaps. The following
section identifies where these overlaps occurred and explains the methods used to adjust the
impacts analysis to avoid double counting of impacts.
Method for Analyzing RCI Cumulative Impacts
To assess the cumulative emission reductions for the policies in the RCI sector, it is necessary to
consider any overlaps among the policies that affect similar types of energy use. Specifically,
some policies (such as RCI-3) are defined by their goals for reducing energy use, while others
(such as RCI-1 and RCI-2) are defined by addressing a specific type of energy use. In these
cases, it is important to consider whether addressing the specific energy use would add to the
overall reductions, or would just be subsumed into the more general reduction goal. To address
this issue, policies were compared in terms of the type of energy use they target and the energy
reduction strategies they implement. Overlaps were identified and quantified by sector (RCI or
government/institutional), type of energy use targeted (water heating, space heating, etc.), and
measure (e.g., solar hot water). If a policy’s impact by sector and type of energy use was less
than the impact from an overlapping policy for that same sector and type of energy use, it was
excluded from the cumulative analysis.
RCI-1 (Improved Building Codes) doesn’t overlap with RCI-2b, at least in theory, because
RCI-2b either should be applied to existing demand or would be for energy efficiency
improvements beyond new codes. There are no overlaps for this policy recommendation.
RCI-2a (Utility and Non-Utility DSM for Peak Use Electricity) quantifies the reduced use of
electricity due to more rational pricing mechanisms, such as real-time pricing. Higher prices
result in lower energy use overall. The quantification of this policy recommendation explicitly
excludes conservation measures, such as high-efficiency air conditioners and chillers, which are
included in RCI-1. This policy recommendation does not overlap with any other policy
recommendations and is assumed to be additional to existing utility demand response measures.
RCI-2b (Utility and Non-Utility DSM and Energy Efficiency for Electricity) is the “headline”
energy efficiency policy recommendation that potentially subsumes other policy
recommendations.
RCI-3a and RCI-3b (Reduced Energy Use in New and Retrofitted [3a] and Existing [3b] StateOwned Buildings) typically show little overlap with utility programmatic investments and are
additional to code improvements. These policy recommendations do not overlap with any other
policy recommendations.

G-2

RCI-4a and RCI-4b (Promotion and Incentives for Improved New [4a] and Existing [4b]
Building Design and Construction) are improvements “beyond code” only for new buildings and
for major retrofits. These policy recommendations were quantified so that the energy efficiency
measures deployed were additional to the more generation energy efficiency measures under
RCI-2b. There are no overlaps for these policy recommendations.
RCI-6 (Incentives and Funds To Promote Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency) provides
additional energy efficiency funding and implementation mechanisms for low-income residential
customers. Well-designed utility and non-utility energy efficiency/demand-side management
programs will target these populations, but not at the level identified under this policy
recommendation. RCI-6 is assumed to overlap 50% with RCI-2b.
RCI-7 (Green Power Purchasing for Consumers) voluntary purchasing programs in the
residential sector do not overlap with other RCI policy recommendations, nor with Energy
Supply (ES) policy recommendations, because green power purchasing is a voluntary, demandside measure, in contrast to the regulatory, supply-side renewable portfolio standard promulgated
under ES-3a and/or 3b. This policy recommendation is assumed to not overlap with any other ES
policy recommendations. However, the biomass generation resulting from this recommendation
partly overlaps with Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste management (AFW) policy
recommendation AFW-4 (Expanded Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for
Electricity, Heat, or Steam Production), and is adjusted for this overlap in the AFW totals.
RCI-8 (Nonresidential Energy Efficiency) is a combined heat and power policy recommendation
that is unique to the RCI sector and is not analyzed in the ES TWG. This recommendation is
assumed not to overlap with any other ES policy recommendations. However, the biomass
generation resulting from this policy recommendation partly overlaps with AFW-4 (Expanded
Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, or Steam Production),
and is adjusted for this overlap in the AFW totals.
RCI-10 (Energy-Savings Sales Tax) reduces prices for energy-efficient goods and increases the
demand for these items that would have not occurred otherwise. There are no overlaps for this
policy recommendation.
Overlaps Between Sectors. The electricity energy efficiency investments from the suite of RCI
policy recommendations reduce electricity demand and thus make it possible to meet renewable
energy mandates more cost-effectively. For example, under RCI-2b, electricity demand in 2025
is reduced by almost 9,600 gigawatt-hours (GWh) versus the reference case. ES-3a assumes a
15% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) by 2025, and with the implementation of RCI-2b would
require 1440 GWh fewer of renewable resources to meet the target. Using the renewable energy
cost assumptions for RCI-7, the reduced spending on higher-cost renewables in 2025 would
result in savings of $13 million in that year alone, and a net present value (NPV) of $54 million
from 2009 to 2025.

RCI-1. Improved Building Codes

Policy Description
This policy recommendation enforces existing building codes by strengthening and streamlining
the building codes adoption and enforcement processes to increase energy efficiency (reduce
energy consumption) for residential, commercial, and industrial buildings.
According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), almost half of U.S. GHG emissions are
associated with the construction and operation of buildings. Building energy codes specify
minimum energy efficiency requirements for new buildings or for existing buildings undergoing
a major renovation. Given the long lifetime of most buildings, enforcing existing state building
codes will provide long-term GHG savings.
Also, the state can improve codes that are not limited to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) systems, including daylighting design to reduce lighting needs, electric lighting design,
building envelope design, and integrated building design strategies.
In Arkansas, residential structures account for 60% of building energy use, with commercial
structures accounting for the remaining 40%. In 2004, the residential sector accounted for 19%
of Arkansas’ total energy consumption, and the commercial sector accounted for 14%. Emphasis
on enforcing residential codes holds a large potential for reducing GHG emissions.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Expand statewide adoption and enforcement of existing building codes (nonquantifiable).
!

Follow national codes without amendments in Arkansas, and update Arkansas codes in
concert with the timing of the national codes.

!

Achieve a 10% improvement in energy efficiency through educational programs for builders,
building inspectors, and other building industry professionals to ensure that the existing
codes are implemented and enforced.

Timing:
! Expand adoption and enforcement efforts of existing code requirements immediately.
!

Coordinate adoption and enforcement initiatives with new code review cycles.

Implementing Parties: Building code officials, homeowners, building owners, builders,
contractors, developers (new construction and existing buildings).
Implementation Mechanisms
Consider updating Arkansas building energy codes through an administrative rulemaking
process, rather than through legislative amendments.

Data Sources:
A. Energy Consumption by Sector (Billions of British thermal units [BBtu])
Historical energy consumption in the state, by sector, is taken from the DOE Energy Information
Administration (EIA) State Energy Data System, available at:
http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/_seds.html. To calculate future projected energy
consumption through 2030, growth factors were applied to the historical 2005 data. The growth
factors are based on a combination of two parameters:
!

Growth Within the RCI Sectors—Growth factors for the residential sector are based on
projected population growth. Population figures are from the University of Arkansas Center
for Business and Economic Research Population Projections for 2001 to 2004
(http://cber.uark.edu/default.asp?show=population), and the Time Series Extrapolations for
2005 to 2030 (http://www.aiea.ualr.edu/research/demographic/population/default.html).
Growth in the commercial sector is based on nonmanufacturing employment growth
projections, and industrial growth is based on manufacturing employment. Employment
projections were taken from the Arkansas Department of Workforce Service's long-term
industry employment projections (http://www.discoverarkansas.net/?PageID=156), with
estimated 2004 employment and 2014 projected employment figures for the manufacturing
and nonmanufacturing sectors.

!

Growth in Electricity Sales—This factor was calculated based on historical retail sales from
1990 to 2005, obtained from the EIA Arkansas Electricity Profile, in gigawatt-hours (GWh),
available from Table 8 at: http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/st_profiles/arkansas.html.

B. Baseline Power Station Electricity Generation (GWh) and Fuel Use (BBtu)
Gross generation for 2005 was obtained from the EIA databases (EIA-906 and EIA-920) on fuel
stocks at all electric power sector generating facilities, broken down by fuel type
(http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia906_920.html). Data for later years were
projected from the 2005 figure, based on projections of growth in generation for the Southwest
Power Pool (SPP) region and the Southeastern Reliability Council (SERC) region. EIA assumes
that Arkansas is located partly (85%) in the SERC region and partly (15%) in the SPP region.
The projected regional consumption and generation data are from the EIA Annual Energy
Outlook 2008 (AEO2008) and can be accessed by downloading the “Electric Generation &
Renewable Resource” file at http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/supplement/index.html. On-site
use was subtracted from all generation figures. The analysis is based on consumption-based
generation, meaning it is based on the electricity sources that deliver electricity to consumers in
state; therefore, the generation of electricity that is exported is not considered.
C. Costs Associated With Electricity Generation
The costs in the United States to produce electricity using different types of technologies are
from the EIA Annual Energy Outlook 2007 (AEO2007), which used the EIA National Energy
Modeling System. Capital costs and fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs are
from Table 39 in the Electricity Market Module, available at:
http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/archive/aeo07/assumption/index.html. Prices for delivered fuel (in
2005$/million [MM] Btu) are provided in the EIA Supplemental Tables to the AEO2007 by
region, with projections through 2030. (Download “Consumption & Prices by Sector & Census

G-6

Division” at: http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/supplement/; fuel prices by region begin with
Table 11.) Transmission costs are added to the total as a constant $80/kilowatt (kW).
Quantification Methods
A. Heat Rates (Btu/kilowatt-hour [kWh])
Heat rates indicate how much fuel is used (Btu) to generate a given amount of electricity (kWh).
They vary greatly, depending on the type of power stations and the fuel used. Heat rates are used
to convert figures for electricity into figures for fuel use, so the amount of fuel used can then be
converted into GHG emissions using the appropriate GHG emission factors. Heat rates for 2005
for each type of generation and fuel were calculated from 2005 fuel use (in BBtu) divided by
2005 generation (GWh). Projections for 2006 and beyond are based on annual combustion
efficiency growth rates for the Mid-Atlantic Area Power Pool region. Combustion efficiency for
a given year is calculated for each fuel type as the fuel use (in quadrillion Btu) divided by the
electricity generated (in billion kWh), and the combustion efficiency growth rate applied to this
value is based on the change in combustion efficiency from the previous year.
B. GHG Emissions Associated With End-Use Consumption (by Sector)
Historical CO2 data by sector (and further broken down by fuel type) were calculated by two
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT)
software modules: the Fossil Fuel Combustion Module and—for emissions from industrial
sources—the SIT module for industry. CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated by the Stationary
Combustion Module and—for emissions from industrial sources—the SIT module for industry.
Projected emissions through 2030 were based on the 2005 data, with growth factors compounded
from year to year, as discussed above in section A of the Data Sources section for energy
consumption.
C. GHG Emissions Associated With Electricity Generation From Different Technologies and
Fuels
The projected data for each GHG were calculated for each fuel and generation type (e.g., nonlignite coal in a steam plant) as a direct product of the projected generation data (in GWh)
described above in section B. Metric tons (t) of CO2 are calculated from generation as:
tCO2 = GWh * (Btu/kWh) * (tCO2/MMBtu) * (% of that fuel in the fuel mix)
where (Btu/kWh) is the heat rate and (tCO2/MMBtu) is the CO2 emission factor. The calculation
is similar for CH4 and N2O, which are then converted to CO2 equivalents (CO2e) using global
warming potentials of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O. The emission factors used for each GHG
were the same as those used in the EPA SIT software modules.

50% coal and 50% gas. This would equate to an emissions intensity of approximately 0.70
MMtCO2e/MWh through 2012. (We assume that sources without significant fuel costs would
not be displaced, e.g., generation of nuclear, hydro, or other renewable resources). The
Hempstead coal plant is expected to come on line during this period. However, beginning in
2013, the policy recommendations are assumed to avoid a mix of new fossil fuel-based
capacity additions for the balance of the planning period. The thermal new-build mix
following 2012 is estimated to be 100% natural gas combined-cycle plants. This would

RCI-2a. Utility and Non-Utility DSM for Peak-Use Electricity

Policy Description
Demand-side management (DSM) is a policy approach that requires actions that influence both
the quantity and the patterns of energy consumed by end users. This policy recommendation
focuses on increasing investment in electricity DSM programs. The goals may be accomplished
through programs run by utilities or others, energy efficiency funds, and/or energy efficiency
measures. These strategies are typically termed DSM activities, and may be designed to work in
tandem with other strategies that can also encourage efficiency gains.
Natural gas utilities have experienced declines in sales to consumers over the last 10 years. As a
result, the RCI TWG has decided that it is not necessary to impose a state goal for utilizing DSM
programs to reduce consumption of natural gas. However, the APSC envisions increased direct
natural gas use, and carbon pricing and other national market factors may also increase gas use in
the future. While promoting direct natural gas use where it accomplishes energy efficiency and
climate change goals, Arkansas should take advantage of any additional opportunities to promote
increased efficiency in the use of natural gas.
GHGs from peak electricity DSM can be reduced from two sources. The first is the reduction of
absolute levels of energy use by consumers due to higher prices. Real-time pricing and smart
metering give consumers information about their energy use that enables them to better
rationalize their use. Time-of-use pricing or other schemes to reflect rational pricing that result in
price increases during peak periods potentially reduce demand by the estimated price elasticity of
demand, typically by –0.20% to –0.50% (U.S. EIA, 2003), so that a 10% increase in prices
would lead to a 2%–5% reduction in demand. In a survey of experience with smart metering,
Owen and Ward (2006) find energy savings of 0%–10%. Peak avoided costs in 2008 are an
average of 74% higher than nonpeak avoided costs, so the demand reductions could be larger,
but this price differential would limit voluntary adoption of the program without regulatory
encouragement.
In Arkansas, the avoided cost of peak electricity is 74% higher than nonpeak electricity. Using a
–0.20% elasticity, this would result in a 15% reduction in demand if the full price were passed on
to customers. However, given uncertainty about the percentage price increase passed along to the
customer (that it will not reflect the full peak cost), and issues about voluntary adoption, the
program is phased in over time, and demand reductions are statically estimated at 5% for the
customers who receive the peak demand measures. For this reason, the statewide reductions from
the program are modest. The costs savings from the program result from assuming that the cost
of the demand reduction measures is less than the avoided cost of electricity.
The other source of GHG reductions from policies to reduce peak demand is energy efficiency
measures that reduce demand during peak periods, such as high-efficiency air conditioners and
chillers. Included in the existing DSM measures in RCI-2b, these measures also reduce new
generation capacity investments, a factor that is not quantified for GHG reductions. The GHG
impacts of other types of rate structures are more difficult to quantify. Curtailment programs that

G-10

allow loads to be shifted during peak periods might result in different emission profiles as these
loads move from peak to shoulder or baseload periods. Overall CO2 savings from these programs
are also difficult to quantify. (This element of this policy recommendation is not quantified.)
Policy Design
Goals: Implement energy efficiency programs and DSM to reduce growth in electric peak
demand by 5% per year by 2010 and by 10% per year by 2015. Energy efficiency gains remain
constant from 2015 through 2025.
Timing: See above.
Implementing Parties: All electric utilities (public and private), municipal electric systems,
electric cooperatives, regulators, and customers (all sectors).
Implementation Mechanisms
Statewide expansion of energy efficiency programs.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
There are currently no regulatory requirements for municipally owned electric systems and
electric cooperatives to offer energy efficiency programs to their customers, although this could
change in the next several years.
The current rate design for electric and gas utilities links a significant amount of the utilities'
revenues to the amount of electricity or natural gas sold. Consequently, the utilities' revenues
may be reduced with the introduction of energy efficiency programs, conservation programs, and
DSM programs that reduce the amount of electricity or natural gas sold. To encourage the
utilities to offer and promote these programs, the APSC should adopt rate designs and cost
recovery mechanisms that are necessary and in the public interest, to decouple the recovery of
the utilities' revenues from the amount of electricity or natural gas sold. Further, the APSC
should identify appropriate incentives that are necessary and in the public interest, to further
encourage the utilities to offer energy efficiency, conservation, and DSM programs.
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Programs in Arkansas—Ark. Code Ann. §§23-3-401 et
seq. authorizes the APSC to develop energy efficiency and conservation programs to address
high energy costs. The statute was passed in 1977 during the previous energy crisis. During the
2005 session, the Arkansas General Assembly passed Act 1939, which asked the Commission to
report on any actions taken or planned pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. §§23-3-401 et seq.
The initial programs are “quick-start” programs offered by the utilities during the initial period of
the APSC’s rules. The total cost of the initial quick-start programs is approximately $18,530,924
for the initial 2-year period ending December 31, 2009. The total cost of all of the energy
efficiency and conservation programs is approximately $0.08–$0.46 per month for an average
residential electric or gas customer. (See
http://www.apscservices.info/rules/energy_conservation_rules_06-004-R.pdf.)

G-11

Net Metering Service—Another service offering is net metering service. Pursuant to Ark. Code
Ann. 23-18-601 et seq., the APSC adopted net metering rules. (See
http://www.apscservices.info/rules/net_metering_rules.pdf.) Net metering permits customers to
provide all or part of their monthly electricity needs through generating facilities powered by
renewable resources. The maximum size is 25 kW for residential customers and 300 kW for
other customers. Customers are able to offset their usage and receive a credit for any excess
generation delivered to the electric utility during a 12-month period.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are reduced by avoided electricity generation from fossil fuel
sources.

Ward (2006), which finds that energy savings from smart meters vary from 0% to 10%. This
is similar to what price elasticity of demand would predict. If peak price tariffs are 10%–20%
higher than nonpeak tariffs, then demand reductions would range from 2.5% to 10% using
price elasticities of –0.20% to –0.5% (EIA, 2003).

T&D losses are typically greater during peak hours than during nonpeak hours. This analysis
uses average T&D losses, so emission reductions might be modestly understated.

of energy consumed by end users. This policy recommendation focuses on increasing investment
in electricity DSM programs. The goals may be accomplished through programs run by utilities
or others, energy efficiency funds, and/or energy efficiency goals. These strategies are typically

Natural gas utilities have experienced declines in sales to consumers over the last 10 years. For
this reason, the TWG has decided that it is not necessary to impose a state goal for utilizing DSM
programs to reduce consumption of natural gas. However, the APSC envisions increased direct
natural gas use, and carbon pricing and other national market factors may increase gas use in the
future as well. While promoting direct natural gas use where it accomplishes energy efficiency
and climate change goals, Arkansas should take advantage of any additional opportunities to
promote increased efficiency in the use of natural gas.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Implement an aggressive goal for energy efficiency and other DSM programs that eliminates
electric utility demand growth over a realistic phase-in period. At this time and for the
GCGW's purposes, average electricity demand growth is projected to be 1.4% through 2030.
Therefore, energy efficiency and DSM programs that deliver demand reductions of 1.4% of
total sales (based on a prior 3-year running average) would be phased in through 2015.
Thereafter, energy efficiency and DSM programs delivering demand reductions equal to
1.4% of total electricity sales would be continued, unless a comprehensive assessment of
potential efficiency gains in Arkansas and best practices nationwide indicates that greater
gains are possible.
!

Implement energy efficiency programs and DSM to reduce growth in total electricity demand
so that annual electricity load growth is equal to 0% by 2015, when all new electricity use is
met with DSM and energy efficiency investments.

Timing: Interim targets are to be linear reductions of projected load growth beginning in 2010.
Approximately 16% of load growth will be met in each year with new energy efficiency
investments during 2010–2015: 16% in 2010, 32% in 2011, 48% in 2012, 64% in 2013, 80% in
2014, and 100% by 2015.
Implementing Parties: All electric utilities (public and private), municipal electric systems,
electric cooperatives, regulators, and customers (all sectors).

G-14

Implementation Mechanisms
In 2009, Arkansas should engage expert assistance in providing an in-depth, comprehensive,
state-specific energy efficiency analysis that outlines the potential to cost-effectively meet future
energy utility demand through efficiency, DSM, and renewable energy (Maryland and Florida
recently made such analyses the basis for energy policy planning). That in-depth study should
quantify, among other things, the climate change emission reductions below baseline that would
result from achieving that potential, and should become a basis for DSM program
implementation.
For utilities subject to the authority of the APSC, the APSC should review any allocations that
are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate crosssubsidization between classes of consumers. For utilities (e.g., municipal utilities) that are not
subject to the authority of the APSC, the governing body for the utility should review any
allocations that are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate
cross-subsidization between classes of consumers.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
The current rate design for electric and gas utilities links a significant amount of the utilities'
revenues to the amount of electricity or natural gas sold. Consequently, the utilities' revenues
may be reduced with the introduction of energy efficiency, conservation, and DSM programs
that reduce the amount of electricity or natural gas sold. To encourage the utilities to offer and
promote these programs, the APSC should adopt rate designs and cost recovery mechanisms that
are necessary and in the public interest, to decouple the recovery of the utilities' revenues from
the amount of electricity or natural gas sold. Further, the APSC should identify appropriate
incentives that are necessary and in the public interest, to further encourage the utilities to offer
energy efficiency, conservation, and DSM programs.
There are currently no regulatory requirements for municipally owned electric systems and
electric cooperatives to offer energy efficiency programs to their customers, although this could
change in the next several years.
Off-Peak and Interruptible Electric Service Rate Schedules and Demand Response
Programs—In addition to the specific programs listed above, all of the electric utilities offer a
variety of rate schedules to encourage commercial and industrial customers to avoid or reduce
electricity usage at peak periods. The rate schedules offer discounts for the use of electricity at
off-peak periods and penalties for use at peak periods. Additionally, customers can choose to
take interruptible service, which permits the utility to interrupt those customers at peak periods
and provides those customers with discounted rates for the electricity consumed. The electric
utilities also offer time-of-use rates for commercial and industrial customers.
Electric Cooperative Energy Efficiency and Conservation Programs and Demand Response
Programs—In addition to the energy efficiency and conservation programs introduced in
response to the APSC’s rules, the electric cooperatives of Arkansas offer a number of programs,
including customer education efforts through the Rural Arkansas magazine, Web page
information, the Doug Rye radio program, articles by Doug Rye, and educational materials for
schools in the cooperatives’ service territory. The cooperatives offer some home weatherization
services for customers in their territory; various appliance programs, including heating and air
G-15

conditioning equipment and water heaters; direct load control of irrigation equipment and air
conditioning equipment; and extensive interruptible service offerings, off-peak service offerings,
and other rate schedules.
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company Energy Audit Program—This program has a cost of
approximately $119,250. It provides residential energy audits that identify potential energy
savings associated with installing weatherization improvements and replacing or upgrading
heating and air conditioning equipment with more energy-efficient equipment. Customers will be
provided a report and recommendations based upon the audit to improve the efficiency of their
electricity use.
Entergy Arkansas, Inc., Home Energy Solutions Program—This program has a cost of
approximately $1,415,000 over the 2-year period ending December 31, 2009. It provides a
variety of offerings to residential customers to promote the use of energy-efficient appliances
and heating and air conditioning equipment. The program provides coupons of up to $250 per
customer for the purchase of ENERGY STAR appliances, heating and air equipment, and windows,
and up to $200 per customer to pay for tune-ups of heating and air conditioning systems to
improve their operating efficiency.
Decoupling Mechanisms—In the recent rate cases for Arkansas Western Gas Company,
Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corporation, and CenterPoint Energy Arkla, the APSC approved
mechanisms to ensure that the utilities do not suffer a loss in revenues due to declines in usage.
These mechanisms address the declining usage per customer that the gas utilities have
confronted. An additional benefit is that the mechanisms should enable the gas utilities to
implement energy efficiency and conservation programs without negatively affecting revenues.
The mechanisms were approved by the APSC as experimental or pilot programs for a number of
years.
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company Commercial Lighting Replacement Program—This
program has a cost of approximately $122,362. It provides coupons to assist commercial
customers in replacing inefficient lighting systems with more energy-efficient lighting systems.
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company Electric Motor Replacement Program—This
program has a cost of approximately $145,350. It provides education to commercial and
industrial customers about the benefits of more efficient electric motors, and up to $170 toward
the replacement of each 25-horsepower motor.
Compact Fluorescent Light Bulb Replacement Program—This program is offered by
Entergy Arkansas, Inc., Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, and Southwestern Electric Power
Company. Intended to promote the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs), the program
provides coupons of $1–$4 to apply toward the purchase of CFLs. The energy savings from a
single CFL will most likely outweigh the cost of the entire energy efficiency and conservation
program for an average residential customer. The cost of the program is approximately $820,000.
Based on APSC data, statewide annual electricity energy efficiency expenditures in 2008 are
extrapolated to be $4.6 million. Using the levelized costs assumptions in RCI-2b, electricity
existing actions are estimated to produce 181 GWh of reductions, which are subtracted from the

G-16

total GWh reductions under RCI-2b each year through 2025. CO2 reductions are estimated using

RCI-3a. Reduced Energy Use in New and Retrofitted State-Owned Buildings:
Government “Lead by Example"

Policy Description
Government-led, or “lead by example,” initiatives help state and local governments achieve
substantial energy cost savings, while promoting the adoption of clean energy technologies for
significant GHG emission reductions in new and existing state and local government buildings.
The proposed policy provides energy efficiency targets that are much higher than code standards.
This policy recommendation sets energy efficiency goals for new construction and major
renovations.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Require that all new state buildings (buildings that utilize a minimum of 20% of state funds),
developments, and major renovations be designed to meet a fossil fuel, GHG-emitting,
energy consumption performance standard of 50% less energy use than the ASHRAE 90.12004 energy standard. Special-use facilities, such as state laboratories, can receive an
exemption from this rule, as determined by the Arkansas Energy Office (AEO).
!

Increase the fossil fuel reduction standard for all new buildings to:
!
!
!
!
!

!

60% reduction in 2012,
70% in 2017,
80% in 2020,
90% in 2025, and
Carbon-neutral in 2030 (using no GHG-emitting energy to operate).

For verification of energy efficiency performance, require state-funded buildings to be
certified by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design™ (LEED) certification
standards.
!

Buildings can also be verified through Green Globes for New Construction (with
independent third-party verification), or other similarly stringent, national, third-partyverified green building certification system.

Timing: Beginning in 2009.
Implementing Parties: State government agencies, local governments, schools, and universities.
Implementation Mechanisms
The state should include full life-cycle cost accounting for all its procurement. ENERGY STARrated appliances are to be a minimum acceptable level of energy efficiency for procurement
where applicable.

G-19

New Buildings:
! State building procurement regulations that include energy requirements for the respective
year.
!

Database of new building performance that includes pertinent building metrics (energy
savings, GHG emission reductions, operational savings, return on investment).

Major Renovations:
! Implementation of energy conservation measures to reduce energy use within state-funded
buildings.
!

A retained savings policy, whereby agencies can retain funds saved by improving energy
efficiency to additional energy efficiency investments.

Certification System:
! AEO can determine which certification systems would be appropriate for energy efficiency
validation.

RCI-3b. Reduced Energy Use in Existing State-Owned Buildings:
Government “Lead by Example"

Policy Description
Government-led, or “lead by example,” initiatives help state and local governments achieve
substantial energy cost savings, while promoting the adoption of clean energy technologies for
significant GHG emission reductions in existing state and local government buildings. The
proposed policy provides energy efficiency targets for existing buildings that are much higher
than code standards.
The Arkansas state government is a significant consumer of energy. The state owns or leases
approximately 29.45 million square feet of building space, and pre-K through 12 schools account
for an additional 85 million square feet. Additional local government buildings are not in this
inventory, such as courthouses, city halls, and other facilities.
Arkansas’ public school buildings are in need of approximately $1.6 trillion of repairs and
improvements that “Impact Functioning of School, i.e., Mechanical, Electrical, HVAC.” These
needs are opportunities for installing more energy-efficient equipment.10
Policy Design
!

Goals: Set a state goal to reduce by 2030, from a 2009 baseline, a minimum of 30% of
electricity consumed by existing state and local facilities, schools, and universities. Require
that 20% of the square footage of the existing state building stock (buildings that utilize a
minimum of 20% of state funds) achieve 7 points (approximately 30% energy savings) per
the full requirements of the LEED for Existing Buildings, Energy and Atmosphere Credit 1
by 2012. A similarly stringent, third-party-verified green building certification system for
commercial buildings may also be used.

!

Require the total square footage of buildings that meet the efficiency standard for existing
buildings to be increased as follows:
40% in 2014,
! 60% in 2016,
! 80% in 2018, and
! 100% in 2020. By this date, the entire state existing building stock will have received
efficiency investments to reach the 30% improvement target.
Adjust the improvement targets and execute programs to achieve additional savings in 2020–
2030.

the state.

!

Set a statewide goal that by 2025, a minimum of 15% of energy consumed by state and local
government buildings will come from renewable in-state energy sources. This policy will
allow the state to “lead by design,” and will create an established market for green power
generators.

Timing: Beginning in 2010.
Implementing Parties: State government agencies, local governments, schools, and universities.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Establish a Sustainability Coordinator function that will define the current performance of
existing building stock, set priorities, and define energy efficiency programs. Utilize LEED
or a similarly stringent rating system to verify and certify performance.

!

Implement a retained savings policy, whereby agencies can retain a portion of funds saved by
improving energy efficiency and apply them to additional energy efficiency investments.

State Audits
Audits of energy use and associated GHG emissions by state agencies are vital for establishing
baseline levels needed to set achievable goals for reducing emissions. It will be important to
audit both state agency facilities and activities in order to fully assess and mitigate each agency’s
carbon footprint. It will also be important for state agencies to audit energy use and GHG
emissions annually for tracking progress toward meeting GHG reduction goals. In so doing, the
GCGW recommends that state agencies consider a phased approach by assessing energy use and
associated emissions first for state facilities and then for state activities.
!

State Facilities—Since facilities are stable and stationary entities, protocols for auditing
energy use and emissions should be fairly routine to implement annually and would assist the
agencies in developing experience that can be applied to assess energy use associated with
their activities.

!

State Activities—Development and implementation of protocols to assess energy and interior
and exterior water use and emissions associated with state agency activities may be more
difficult, because activities vary depending on the mission of each agency, and are likely to
change frequently, even within an agency. Nevertheless, an analysis of energy use and
emissions associated with agency activities is necessary to develop plans to mitigate GHG
emissions and demonstrate progress toward meeting GHG emission reduction goals.

In addition, the state should consider a phased approach, starting with the larger state
government agencies first, to develop protocols and experience that can then be used to assist
smaller agencies and the university system. Such an approach should be designed to leverage
experience and assessment tools that can be used by other entities (e.g., school districts) to foster
consistency in developing and implementing audit protocols on a routine basis.

RCI-4a. Promotion and Incentives for Improved New Building Design and
Construction

Policy Description
Almost half of all GHG emissions in the United States are associated with residential,
commercial, and industrial buildings and the energy associated with building materials.
Improving the energy efficiency design and construction of buildings will have an immediate
and ongoing impact on GHG reduction.
This policy provides incentives and targets to induce the owners and developers of new buildings
to improve the efficiency with which energy and other resources are used in those buildings,
along with provisions for raising targets periodically and providing resources to building industry
professionals to help achieve the desired building performance. This policy can include elements
to encourage the improvement and review of energy use goals over time, and to encourage
flexibility in contracting arrangements to encourage integrated energy- and resource-efficient
design, construction, and renovation. Incentives could include low-cost loans for investments in
energy efficiency, tax credits, and feebates. The use of third-party rating systems will reduce the
requirement for significant oversight and enforcement by state organizations.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Provide tiered incentives for energy efficiency in new buildings that achieve at least a 20%
reduction in energy use relative to the ASHRAE 90.1-2004 energy standard for commercial
buildings, and the 2004 Arkansas Energy Code for residential buildings through certification
in one of the following rating systems:
LEED (New Construction, Core & Shell, Commercial Interiors, Homes, or other
appropriate version),
! Green Globes New Construction, or
! Similarly stringent, third-party-verified green building certification system for
commercial or residential buildings.
Make the incentives for this program commensurate with the energy efficiency threshold
achieved. Tier the thresholds as follows:
!

!

20%
! 25%
! 30%
! 30% and above
Increase the benchmark minimum efficiency standard for existing buildings as follows:

efficiency and apply them to additional energy efficiency investments;

!

Low-interest loans to fund energy efficiency retrofits for commercial and industrial
buildings;

!

Tax credits for energy-efficient residential, commercial, and industrial buildings; and

!

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Based on APSC data, statewide annual natural gas energy efficiency expenditures in 2008 are
extrapolated to be $4.6 million. Using the levelized cost assumptions in RCI-2b, gas existing

Additional Benefits and Costs
Wood products contain much less embodied energy than other building materials and, unlike
other building materials, function as long-term sequesters of carbon. Additionally, wood
products sourced locally have more energy and carbon advantages compared to products
transported from distant sources. For example, a lumber-framed wall or floor system requires
just 40% of the fossil fuel energy needed to manufacture a concrete wall or floor system and only
20% of the fossil fuel energy need to manufacture a steel wall or floor.20
The quantification of costs and benefits of energy efficiency only includes technologies that are
currently commercialized. New technologies, such as building-integrated solar PV panels, LED
lighting, etc., that might lead to additional CO2 reductions at a reduced cost, are not included in

RCI-4b. Promotion and Incentives for Improved Existing Building Design and
Construction

Policy Description
Almost half of all GHG emissions in the United States are associated with residential,
commercial, and industrial buildings and the energy associated with building materials.
Improving the energy efficiency design of buildings will have an immediate and ongoing impact
on GHG reduction.
This policy provides incentives and targets to induce the owners and developers of existing
buildings to improve the efficiency with which energy and other resources are used in those
buildings, along with provisions for raising targets periodically and providing resources to
building industry professionals to help achieve the desired building performance. This policy can
include elements to encourage the improvement and review of energy use goals over time, and to
encourage flexibility in contracting arrangements to promote integrated energy- and resourceefficient design, energy demand reduction, and practices that maintain optimal energy use.
Incentives could include low-cost loans for investments in energy efficiency, tax credits, and
feebates.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Measure the performance of energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings against a
regional average of similar building types.
!

Provide tiered incentives for energy efficiency in existing buildings that achieve at least a
15% reduction in energy use versus the regional average for similar buildings through
certification in one of the following rating systems:
LEED for Existing Buildings or
! Similarly stringent, third-party-verified green building certification system for
commercial or residential buildings.
Make the incentives for this program commensurate with the energy efficiency threshold
achieved. Tier the thresholds as follows:
!

!

15%
! 20%
! 25%
! 30% and above
Increase the benchmark minimum efficiency standard for existing buildings as follows:
!

!

20% in 2014
! 25% in 2016
! 30% in 2018
! 35% in 2020
!

G-31

!

Require participating organizations or individuals to provide feedback on the costs and actual
performance of energy efficiency improvements, and annual GHG reduction levels in new
construction against the benchmark.

!

Offer low-cost loans or incentives to consumers for weatherization programs, including
weatherstripping and insulation improvements.

Timing: Develop legislation in 2009; make incentive measures available in 2010; begin program
in 2011.
Implementing Parties: All builders, building material suppliers, recycled building material
sellers, and home improvement stores. The aforementioned should be considered for both private
and pubic construction projects.
Implementation Mechanisms
LEED, or equivalent rating system, will be used to define the benchmark and actual energy
savings achieved. Relevant implementation mechanisms may include:
!

Retro-commissioning of existing buildings;

!

Audits of energy performance and operations by state and other government buildings;

!

Implementation of design features to reduce energy use within state-funded buildings,
through incorporation of proven planning guides and regulations;

!

Financial and technical assistance for implementation of energy-saving programs in existing
buildings, and a requirement that all state-owned buildings implement an energy
management program;

!

Low-interest loans to fund energy efficiency retrofits for commercial and industrial
buildings; and

!

Tax credits for energy-efficient RCI buildings. Funding for education programs could come
from a variety of sources, including professional associations, matching grants from federal
agencies, regional market energy efficiency organizations, and energy efficiency from
utilities and non-utilities, among others.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company Energy Audit Program—This program has a cost of
approximately $119,250. It provides residential energy audits that identify potential energy
savings associated with installing weatherization improvements and replacing or upgrading
heating and air conditioning equipment with more energy-efficient equipment. Customers are
provided a report and recommendations based upon the audit to improve the efficiency of their
electricity use.
Based on APSC data, statewide annual natural gas energy efficiency expenditures in 2008 are
extrapolated to be $4.6 million. Using the levelized cost assumptions in RCI-2b, gas existing
actions are estimated to produce 1200 BBtu of reductions, which are subtracted from the total
GWh reductions under RCI-1 and RCI-4a and RCI-4b equally each year through 2025.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Wood products contain much less embodied energy than other building materials and, unlike
other building materials, function as long-term sequesters of carbon. Additionally, wood
products sourced locally have more energy and carbon advantages compared to products
transported from distant sources. For example, a lumber-framed wall or floor system requires
just 40% of the fossil fuel energy needed to manufacture a concrete wall or floor system and only
20% of the fossil fuel energy need to manufacture a steel wall or floor.21
The quantification of costs and benefits of energy efficiency only includes technologies that are
currently commercialized. New technologies, such as building-integrated solar PV panels, LED
lighting, etc., that might lead to additional CO2 reductions at a reduced cost, are not included in
the cost analysis. Operation and maintenance costs should be considered in life-cycle cost
accounting for high-efficiency buildings.

RCI-5. Education for Consumers, Industry Trades, and Professions

Policy Description
Education under this policy recommendation falls under two broad categories:
!

Consumer awareness education on how consumers can reduce GHG emissions, and

!

Technical education for builders and contractors on the specific methods they can incorporate
to reduce GHG emissions at every stage of construction.

The ultimate effectiveness of emission reduction activities in many cases depends on providing
information and education to consumers regarding the energy and GHG emission implications of
their choices. Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a broad awareness of climate
change issues and effects (including co-benefits, such as clean air and public health) among the
state’s citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in actions to reduce GHG
emissions in their personal and professional lives.
This policy recommendation also addresses education and outreach programs for building
professionals to encourage incorporation of energy efficiency and GHG emission reduction
considerations, such as programs to train builders and contractors.
Education and training should also be made available to builders and contractors and others for
retrofitting existing buildings.
Policy Design
Goals: Develop consumer and technical/professional education courses and outreach programs
for GHG emission reductions to increase the number of professionals trained in energy
efficiency.
Timing: By 2010, put the education/training recommendation in place and begin outreach
programs.
Implementing Parties: Consumers, retailers, manufacturers, technicians, and professionals in
building and related trades, code enforcement agencies, trade schools, community colleges,
universities, Arkansas Department of Higher Education.
Issues related to Arkansas K-12 public schools are addressed in Cross-Cutting Issues policy
recommendation CC-6 (State Climate Public Education and Outreach).
Implementation Mechanisms
Funding for education programs could come from a variety of sources, including professional
associations, matching grants from federal agencies, regional market energy efficiency
organizations, and energy efficiency surcharges paid by energy customers of from utilities and
non-utilities, among others.

approximately $0.01–$0.04 per month for an average residential electric or gas customer.
Natural Gas Customer Education Programs—CenterPoint Energy Arkla, Arkansas Western
Gas Company, and Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corporation will each provide additional companyspecific customer education messages. The cost of the program is approximately $409,636. The
messages will be designed to support the statewide education program and direct customers to
energy efficiency and conservation opportunities specific to each company.

RCI-6. Incentives and Funds To Promote Renewable Energy and Energy
Efficiency

Policy Description
This policy recommendation refers to financial mechanisms for energy efficiency that could
increase program participation and investment by providing incentives to a variety of customer
classes to improve the energy performance of buildings, equipment, and residences. These
incentives could be targeted to residential customers, small businesses, and low-income
consumers, as well as to other customer classes, including larger businesses and the industrial
sector.
A public benefits charge (sometimes called a systems benefits charge) is a fee attributed to utility
customers based on their use of energy in a given time period. With deregulation in many states,
the public utility commissions often lost the ability to require electric utilities to implement
efficiency programs. The result in many states was the development of the public benefits
charge, which is a non-bypassable charge on electric bills. The funds collected are then provided
to a third party to provide energy efficiency programming, or can support implementation of a
revolving-loan payment, establishment of a micro-loan program, and tax incentives. Energy
audits should be included to aid in assessing needs and tracking progress toward improvement.
At least 33% of Arkansas' population has an income of less than $30,000/year, of which 20%–
30% is spent on utility bills. There are currently not enough weatherization or energy
conservation programs in place to reduce the economic burden on this population or to have a
scalable impact on mitigating the GHG emissions produced by these homes. Providing
traditional financing options for low-income homeowners will not meet their needs or achieve
any meaningful scale.
The need exists for identifying these homeowners; educating them about, and the opportunity
for, energy audits; and financing the implementation of energy-efficient measures with a shared
savings approach.
There would be multiple benefits to develop an employer-driven, local economic impact
initiative that reaches out to employees (scalable), connecting them to trained energy auditors
(provided by public benefit funds), and to create a Program-Related Investment (PRI) fund
(revolving energy fund) to finance moderate energy efficiency measures for employees (builds
employee retention and adds benefits). The resulting energy savings would be split between the
employee’s monthly payroll deduction (paid into the PRI) and the employee, manifested in the
lower utility bill. Employers would be provided the incentive to create the PRI with either a state
tax credit or the right to “bank” or capture the aggregated annual CO2 savings from their
employees.
Manufactured (mobile) homes account for approximately 27% of residential structures in
Arkansas. Mobile homes and temporary dwellings (hunting camps, boat houses) are exempt from
compliance with the Arkansas Energy Code and fall under U.S. Department of Housing and

G-37

Urban Development (HUD) regulation. These homes are factory-made and can more easily
implement efficiency improvements. ENERGY STAR has a program for energy-efficient
manufactured homes.
In Schweitzer et al.’s (2003) review of 20 major energy audits, the audits accounted for less than
4% of program spending on conservation, yet resulted in an estimated 18% of cost and energy
savings. Audits are one of the lowest-cost conservation measures available to utilities and nonutility programs and form a core element of DSM programs.
Policy Design
Goals:
Low-Income Pilot Program
! Fund a Low-Income Pilot Program in rural Arkansas counties that targets weatherization of
the counties' low-income population, working with the local economic development office,
Arkansas community action agencies, industries, and manufacturers.
!

Beginning year one of the program, double the estimated 1,200 homes a year that are
currently receiving weatherization assistance to 2,400 homes. Each year for the next 5 years,
increase the number of homes receiving weatherization, until by 2015 10,000 homes are
being retrofitted annually. At the 10,000 homes per year weatherization rate in 2015, by 2025
138,000 homes would be weatherized, which is 78% of 2008 eligible units (assumes no new,
eligible, low-income residences over the 2010–2025 period).

!

Ultimately, target 90% of the low-income homeowner population (approximately 178,000
residences in 2008) who are eligible for federal weatherization assistance.

!

Expand available funding per residence from the current level (approximately $2,800) to be
able to upgrade major appliances, such as furnaces.

!

Target energy efficiency improvements of 33% per upgraded residence.

!

Increase these targets annually until the low-income target is achieved, and then target
weatherization in homes that are above the federal weatherization eligibility level.

New Manufactured Housing
! Require that the incentive program for manufactured housing purchased in or shipped to
Arkansas be ENERGY STAR-qualified or have other equivalent energy-efficient, third-party
certification.
!

Ensure that these units are at least 30% more energy efficient than comparable available
manufactured housing.

!

Through the incentives, increase the penetration of energy-efficient manufactured housing to
75% of new manufactured housing sales by 2025.

Other
! Add a minimum of 75–100 new certified auditors, which are green collar jobs.

G-38

!

Expand energy audit programs for all sectors, and increase them annually until 100%
saturation is achieved.

Timing:
Low-Income Pilot Program
! 2009–10—Launch a Low-Income Pilot Program in select rural counties through publicprivate partnerships.
!

2009–10—Build the state's capacity of certified energy auditors/raters; identify and
prequalify subcontractors statewide.

!

July 2010—Fund a program manager and adequate staff to begin statewide implementation
of the goal 2,400 homes.

!

2010 and beyond—Increase funding to meet annual targets.

Manufactured Homes
! Begin in 2010 an incentive program for ENERGY STAR-Qualified Manufactured Housing or
other equivalent efficient third-party certification.
Other
! Expand energy audit programs by 2010. Make the annual increase 10% of the audited stock.
Implementing Parties: Commercial and industrial energy users in the private and public sectors
(including those responsible for mixed-use projects), nongovernmental organizations, public
agencies, utilities, building design and construction professionals, lenders, the Arkansas Chapter
of the U.S. Green Building Council.
Implementation Mechanisms
Offer low-cost loans or incentives to consumers for weatherization programs, including
weatherstripping and insulation improvements. These could include “weatherization kits” like
those being offered to low-income residents in Chicago to improve their building energy
efficiency and reduce energy expenditures.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Energy Efficiency, Conservation, and DSM Programs—The current rate design for electric
and gas utilities links a significant amount of the utilities' revenues to the amount of electricity or
natural gas sold. Consequently, the utilities' revenues may be reduced with the introduction of
energy efficiency, conservation, and DSM programs that reduce the amount of electricity or
natural gas sold. To encourage the utilities to offer and promote these programs, the APSC
should adopt rate designs and cost recovery mechanisms that are necessary and in the public
interest, to decouple the recovery of the utilities' revenues from the amount of electricity or
natural gas sold. Further, the APSC should identify appropriate incentives that are necessary and
in the public interest, to further encourage the utilities to offer energy efficiency, conservation,
and DSM programs.

Arkansas Community Action Agencies. The program, which targets the most energy-inefficient
homes, is designed to provide weatherization assistance for approximately 2,500 homes over the
initial 2-year period ending December 31, 2009. Approved measures include attic insulation,
floor insulation, wall insulation, duct insulation, duct sealing, window sealing, window
replacement, furnace and air conditioner tune-up and replacement, lighting, and smart
thermostats. The program pays up to 50% of the cost of a home energy audit and up to 50% of
the cost of weatherization measures up to a maximum of $1,500 per home.

RCI-7. Green Power Purchasing for Consumers

Policy Description
Green power purchasing refers to a variety of consumer-driven strategies to increase the
production and delivery of low-GHG power sources beyond levels achieved through RPS and
other mandatory programs. These sources include solar, wind, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and
low-impact hydroelectric. Green power purchasing programs provide consumers with
information about alternative green sources of energy they can select, rather than the traditional,
more carbon-intensive sources.
As of April 2008, the leading green power program in the country had a customer participation
rate of over 20%, but green power accounted for 4.6% of its load (NREL, 2008). This implies
that participating customers were purchasing green power for less than 25% of their total
electricity consumption, or else only small electricity users were participating. Therefore, this
policy not only provides incentives for participation, but also encourages large-scale purchases
so that customers may use green power to offset their entire electricity consumption.
Policy Design
Goals:
! By 2025, this voluntary program incentivizes one of four residential customers to participate
in green power purchasing programs, and those who do participate purchase up to 25% of
their total electricity use from renewable resources.
!

Develop a mechanism that strongly encourages utilities purchasing this power to develop
green power in Arkansas.

Timing: Consumers participate in green power purchasing programs beginning in 2010,
achieving the 25% goal linearly by 2025.
Implementing Parties: State facilities, electric utilities, renewable energy producers, electricity
consumers, and buyers of energy-using appliances and equipment.
Implementation Mechanisms
Arkansas will implement programs to provide consumers the option to purchase green power.
According to Bird et al. (2007), the premium paid by consumers for green power declined from
$34.80/MWh to $21.20/MWh between 2000 and 2006. In 2025, the green power premium
estimated under this policy for Arkansas is closer to $10.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Green Power Purchasing for Consumers—In the near future, the Electric Cooperatives of
Arkansas plan to introduce a green power purchasing option for customers. It will be initially
based on available hydropower credits. Additionally, the generation portfolios of several utilities
include hydropower, and the generation portfolios of two electric utilities include wind
generation.
G-43

Net Metering Service—Pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. 23-18-601 et seq., the APSC adopted net
metering rules (see http://www.apscservices.info/rules/net_metering_rules.pdf). Net metering
permits customers to provide all or part of their monthly electricity needs through generating
facilities powered by renewable resources. The maximum size is 25 kW for residential customers
and 300 kW for other customers. Customers are able to offset their usage and receive a credit for
any excess generation delivered to the electric utility during a 12-month period.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are reduced by avoided electricity generation from fossil fuel
sources.

RCI-8. Nonresidential Energy Efficiency

Policy Description
This policy recommendation removes regulatory impediments and modifies utility rates to
remove financial barriers to combined heat and power (CHP). CHP refers to any system that
simultaneously or sequentially generates electric energy and utilizes the thermal energy that is
normally wasted. The recovered thermal energy can be used for industrial process steam, space
and water heating, air conditioning, water cooling, product drying, or nearly any other thermal
energy need in the commercial and industrial sectors. The end result is significantly increased
efficiency over generating electric and thermal energy separately. In fact, many CHP systems are
capable of an overall efficiency of over 80%—double that of conventional systems. Another
significant advantage is the reduced T&D losses associated with centralized power generation.
There are significant opportunities for CHP plants in Arkansas. Fully 47% of industrial natural
gas use in the South Census region is used for process heating or cooling that might be suitable
for CHP (U.S. DOE/EIA, 2002).
Industrial and commercial facilities served by 480-volt, three-phase power from a utility
typically use dry-type transformers to distribute power internally at lower voltages, such as for
lighting and plug power. Efficient transformers are able to reduce T&D losses throughout the
period of use. When combined with incentives, the electricity saved by such energy-efficient
transformers typically has a 3-year payback period. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 set a standard
for National Electrical Manufacturing Association (NEMA) TP-1 low-voltage distributors,
effective 2007. Standards for medium- and high-voltage distributors have been ruled to have no
significant impact on the environment. 22 While federal standards have increased the efficiency of
transformers, the RCI TWG recommends that Arkansas consider adopting incentives to
encourage transformers that can efficiently handle nonlinear (variable) loads from digital
equipment and lighting. The RCI TWG has not quantified the costs and benefits from such an
incentive policy.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Install additional CHP and waste heat recovery technical potential on 25% of new boiler
installations of a minimum size rating consistent with a reasonable payout in the state.
!

Encourage efficient transformers where options for improved energy efficiency are available.

Timing: Achieve goals by 2010.
Implementing Parties: APSC.

For utilities subject to the authority of the APSC, the APSC should review any allocations that
are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate crosssubsidization between classes of consumers. For utilities (e.g., municipal utilities) that are not

EPA Combined Heat and Power Partnership—This voluntary program seeks to reduce the
environmental impact of power generation by promoting the use of CHP. The partnership works
closely with energy users, the CHP industry, state and local governments, and other clean energy
stakeholders to facilitate the development of new projects and to promote their environmental
and economic benefits. 23
Energy Policy Act of 2005—EPAct 2005 set a standard for NEMA TP-1 low-voltage
distributors, effective 2007. Standards for medium- and high-voltage distributors have been ruled
to have no significant impact on the environment (see http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPAAIR/2007/November/Day-09/a22004.htm).
Incentives and Resources To Promote CHP (a.k.a. Cogen)—The APSC established
cogeneration rules several years ago (see
http://www.apscservices.info/rules/cogeneration_rules.pdf).
Support for Switching to Less Carbon-Intensive Fuels (Coal and Oil to Natural Gas or
Biomass)—Ark. Code Ann. 23-18-701 et seq. requires electric utilities to consider clean energy
resources as a part of any resource plans. (See the APSC’s "Resource Planning Guidelines for
Electric Utilities" at: http://www.apscservices.info/rules/resource_plan_guid_for_elec_06-028R_1-7-07.pdf). As a part of the utilities’ resource planning, they must consider clean energy
sources. The APSC is empowered to encourage or require utilities to consider clean energy
sources. Two electric utilities have purchased wind-generating facilities that are included in the
generation portfolios of those companies.
Additionally, Southwestern Electric Power Company has constructed a natural gas-fired
generating plant and plans to construct another one. Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corporation
has purchased an existing natural gas-fired generating plant and is in the process of constructing
a natural gas-fired generating plant. And Entergy and Oklahoma Gas & Electric each is in the
process of acquiring a natural gas-fired generating plant.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are reduced by avoided electricity generation from fossil fuel
sources.

Quantification Methods: See RCI-1.
Key Assumptions:
! Technical potential for CHP in Arkansas in 2005 is 660 MW for commercial and 1120 MW
for industrial facilities. This serves as an estimate for CHP retrofit capacity, which is
implemented linearly for 15 years.
!

Each year, 25% of new thermal demand is installed with CHP.

!

The avoided CO2 emissions are assumed to be Arkansas average emission intensities over the
2010–2025 period, estimated at 0.58 tCO2/MWh in 2009.

G-48

!

The fuel for new commercial CHP is 100% gas; for new industrial and advanced biofuel
refineries, the fuel is 33% coal, 33% gas, and 33% biomass.

!

The program deploys only 30% of estimated technical CHP potential for commercial,
industrial, and advanced biofuel refineries in the state over the life of the program.

!

T&D losses are 8.1%.24

!

For levelized costs of energy efficiency measures and avoided costs of energy, see RCI-1.

!

Avoided capacity charges for commercial CHP are: ancillary service charge—
$0.28/kW/month; facility capacity – distribution charge—$1.65/kW/month; on-peak demand
charge—$1.90/kW/month; system usage charge—$0.35/kWh.

!

New commercial and industrial CHP grows at 1.4% and 1.5%, respectively, over the 2006–
2020 period. 25

!

Biofuels processing CHP supply is derived from the assumption that biofuel produced in the
state will be 15% of total transportation fuel by 2025, and that waste heat will be captured in
25% of these sites to generate electricity.

Key Uncertainties
The quantification of costs and benefits of energy efficiency only includes technologies that are
currently commercialized. New technologies, such as building-integrated solar PV panels, LED
lighting, etc., that might lead to additional GHG reductions at a reduced cost are not included in
the cost analysis.
Estimating the costs of CHP into the distant future is tentative, because cost estimates are highly
sensitive to natural gas prices, the cost of avoided power, and the assumption about the CO2
intensity of displaced electricity.
Effectively addressing the efficiency of nonlinear (variable) power loads (e.g., computers,
fluorescent lighting) remains a consideration under the new standards.”
Additional Benefits and Costs
This analysis does not consider CHP benefits from avoided costs of backup power systems.
The quantification of costs and benefits of energy efficiency only includes technologies that are
currently commercialized. New technologies, such as building-integrated solar PV panels, LED
lighting, etc., that might lead to additional CO2 reductions at a reduced cost, are not included in
the cost analysis.

RCI-9. Support for Energy-Efficient Communities, Including Smart Growth

Policy Description
Smart growth dictates how the state will invest its money in community development, either by
regulating local land-use decisions or by providing incentives to influence those decisions.
Existing building, zoning codes, and business schedules often work against smart growth
development. In the context of GHG emissions, smart growth policies can serve to revitalize and
reuse commercial sites and will help preserve critical natural resources and farmland.
Improved community planning aims to create communities that are, among other attributes,
livable, designed for reduced use of energy both within homes and businesses and in the
transport sector, and have a reduced environmental impact relative to typical developments.
Variants on the smart growth concept exist, but many call for clustering living units with easy
access (often walking distance) to shops, schools, and entertainment and recreational facilities;
incorporating elements of energy-efficient design and renewable energy in buildings; sharing
energy facilities between buildings (for example, district heating systems); preserving open
spaces, providing shared office space—especially in those buildings with higher energy
efficiencies; and instituting alternative work schedules, telework options, and carpooling.
Telework is an employment arrangement where an employee works or "telecommutes” remotely
from home or a satellite office, part or all of the time. (See
http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/topic.php?id=4.)
These concepts—improved building energy performance, innovative working arrangements, and
community planning—offer significant synergies for Arkansas. This policy suggests a
combination of incentives and targets to induce the owners and developers of buildings and the
communities in which they are located to produce and operate buildings and communities that
produce markedly lower GHG emissions than existing buildings and communities.
Policy Design
Goals:
! By 2009, provide resources for local jurisdictions to examine and rewrite their outdated state
and local codes to accommodate for smart growth initiatives in community planning and
development. Implementing smart growth policies is expected to reduce (per-unit) energy
consumption, GHG emissions, infrastructure costs, and new construction by 30% by 2030.
!

Design all new buildings, developments, and major renovations to meet the targets in RCI-4a
and RCI-4b.

!

Identify the link between GHG reductions and land-use planning decisions, as well as the
reduction potential and targets for Arkansas.

!

Create incentives to encourage smart growth by meeting Built Green Community
certification or the LEED-ND (LEED for Neighborhood Development) gold level, with
minimum energy and location criteria. Encourage compact and transit-oriented, mixed-use

G-51

development within urban growth areas that results in reduced vehicle miles traveled and
GHG emissions and encourages walking and biking.
!

Improve planning to reduce sprawl modeled after the "California Communities Climate
Action Plan" and others.

!

Promote consideration of location as part of a building's GHG footprint.

!

Encourage state and local governments and private firms to adopt telework policies to reduce
building and transportation-related GHG emissions. Commission a study on the effects of
alternative work schedules similar to West Virginia House Resolution #34 and others.

!

Limit sprawl by enabling transfer of development rights, revitalizing communities through
developed land, and building reuse incentives, and institute a variety of conservation
measures for woodlands and wetlands.

!

Support locally owned shops, restaurants, and farmers' markets to help local businesses and
family farms remain profitable, thus strengthening the local economy and protecting rural
legacy and lands.

Timing: See above.
Implementing Parties: State and local governments, developers and builders, private firms,
land-use planners.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Initiate a study of the potential impacts of a compressed work week and the option of
telecommuting on cost and energy savings to the state and its employees, and the impact of a
foreshortened work week on access to essential government operations.

!

Implement executive, legislative, and administrative changes to enhance the integrated
design of communities, energy systems, and transport systems.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
This policy is a qualitative study recommendation. GHG reductions and costs or cost savings for
Arkansas were not calculated for this recommendation, but are calculated under other policy
recommendations. Smart growth planning quantification was performed under Transportation
and Land use policy recommendation TLU-4 (Smart Growth, Pedestrian and Bicycle
Infrastructure), which assumes higher population density tracts due to policies of 35% compared
to 10% under business as usual. This results in fewer vehicle miles traveled and lower GHG
emissions. See http://www.arclimatechange.us/TLU.cfm for the TLU policy description.
GHG reductions and costs or cost savings for Arkansas from high-performance building policies
are quantified under RCI-4a and RCI-4b.
A report for the Consumer Electronics Association estimates that each commuter with a one-way
commute length of 17 miles who telecommutes three times a week saves nearly 200 gallons of
gasoline per year. 27 Energy reductions and GHG mitigation are maximized with organizational
support for telecommuting, reducing incremental floor space requirements and appliance energy
consumption.

RCI-10. Energy-Savings Sales Tax

Policy Description
This policy recommendation refers to a sales tax exemption for energy-efficient products, such
as CFLs; geothermal heat pumps; highly efficient (> 14.4 SEER [seasonal energy efficiency
ratio]) heat pump systems (auxiliary heat may be supplied by electricity or natural gas); and
ENERGY STAR-certified water heaters, refrigerators and freezers, clothes washers and dryers, and
dishwashers. Establishing a market signal that rewards lower-carbon purchase decision making
provides consumers an incentive to improve their energy efficiency and reduce their adverse
impacts on climate.
The list of energy efficiency measures that this policy recommendation applies to contains the
same measures that utility energy efficiency programs typically pursue. Utility programs assume
that some portion (usually ~25%) of the capital costs of the efficiency measure is paid for by the
participant. Thus, this policy recommendation reduces the purchase price (capital cost) of
energy-efficient goods by consumers by the amount of the sales tax. However, these costs are
then paid for by the state, rather than consumers.
The effect of the sales tax exemption on the purchase of energy-efficient products is a function of
the price elasticity of demand. As the price of the efficient products decreases, the demand for
these products increases. Price elasticity of demand for electricity in the short run is close to
–0.20% and in the long run is closer to –0.50% (U.S. EIA, 2003). If the policy eliminates all
taxes (estimated at 6%), this would lead to a 2%–5% increase in demand.
Policy Design
Goals: Implement a sales tax exemption for all consumers on energy-efficient equipment,
including (but not limited to) CFLs; geothermal heat pumps; highly efficient heat pump systems;
and ENERGY STAR-certified products, including water heaters, refrigerators and freezers, clothes
washers and dryers, and dishwashers.
Timing: Implement the sales tax exemption by 2010.
Implementing Parties: Retail businesses and consumers.
Implementation Mechanisms
Tax exemptions for eligible measures would need to be approved by the appropriate
jurisdictions, and tax relief mechanisms at the point of sale would need to be developed.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Act 120 of the 1st Extraordinary Session of 1983 exempts Gross Receipts Tax and Other State
Excise Tax on the first 500 kWh of electricity per month for low- and moderate-income
residential customers with incomes at or below $12,000/year. (No Web link available.)

G-54

Compact Fluorescent Light Bulb Replacement Program—Offered by Entergy Arkansas, Inc.,
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company, and Southwestern Electric Power Company, this program
provides coupons of $1–$4 to apply toward the purchase of CFLs. The energy savings from a
single CFL will most likely outweigh the cost of the entire energy efficiency and conservation
programs for an average residential customer. The cost of the program is approximately
$820,000.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions are reduced by avoided electricity generation from fossil fuel

Quantification Methods: See RCI-1.
Key Assumptions:
! This policy recommendation reduces consumer costs of energy efficiency measures and thus
increases deployment. The assumed increase in deployment is a linear function of the
estimated tax level. Low tax levels are expected to have little impact on purchasing decisions.
High taxes and subsequent tax holidays will have a greater impact on consumers' buying
energy-efficient equipment.
!

The assumed state tax rate is 6%, which is the amount used to estimate the increased
purchases from the tax holiday.

G-55

!

Energy efficiency deployment under RCI-2b is used for baseline demand. The measures
deployed under this policy recommendation are assumed to be similar to those deployed
under RCI-2b. RCI-10 leads to additional energy efficiency deployment, due to reduced
participant capital costs. By 2025, this policy results in a cumulative reduction of 0.4% of
annual sales.

!

The price elasticity of demand for energy-efficient products is the same as the estimated price
elasticity of demand for electricity in EIA (2003). The short-run price elasticity of demand
for energy-efficient products begins at –0.2% in 2010 and increases linearly to the long-run
elasticity of –0.5% in 2025.

!

For levelized costs of energy efficiency measures and avoided costs of energy, see RCI-1.

Key Uncertainties
The quantification of costs and benefits of energy efficiency only includes technologies that are

the cost analysis.

Annex G-1
Methodology for Calculating Existing Actions to Reduce Energy
Consumption
The policy recommendations for the RCI sectors are affected by both state and federal policies
that incentivize or mandate more efficient use of energy. The federal Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 was signed into law in December 2007. This law contains several
requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they are implemented over the next few years.
During the GCGW process, sufficient information was identified (e.g., implementation
schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with implementing energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting in Arkansas under Title III of the EISA.
!

For the residential sector emissions reductions were estimated for: external power supply
efficiency standards, residential boilers, furnace fan standard process, regional standards for
furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps, standby mode for electrical appliances,
energy standards for home appliances, efficient light bulbs, incandescent reflector lamp
efficiency standards.

!

For the commercial sector emissions reductions were estimated for: external power supply
efficiency standards, standby mode for electrical appliances, efficient light bulbs,
incandescent reflector lamp efficiency standards, regional standards for furnaces, central air
conditioners, and heat pumps, walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers, electric motor efficiency
standards, and metal halide lamp fixtures.

!

For the industrial sector emissions reductions were estimated for: efficient light bulbs,
regional standards for furnaces, central air conditioners, and heat pumps, incandescent
reflector lamp efficiency standards, electric motor efficiency standards, and metal halide
lamp fixtures.

The net effect of these reductions was estimated at 1,900 GWh of electricity and 1,200 BBtu of
natural gas savings in Arkansas by 2025. The associated GHG reductions for these savings are
projected to be 0.9 MMtCO2e for the year 2025 using the RCI TWG CO2 methodology. Note,
however, that GHG emission reductions associated with the Title IV (Energy Savings in
Buildings and Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in Government and Public Institutions)
requirements of the federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 have not been
quantified because of the uncertainties in how they will be implemented. It is expected that the
Title IV and Title V requirements will overlap with some of the RCI policy recommendations,
especially RCI-2b, RCI-3a, RCI-3b, RCI-4a, and RCI-4b.
Arkansas has also started energy efficiency programs to reduce energy consumption within the
state. The Arkansas Public Service Commission has authorized quick-start programs of
approximately $18,530,924 for the initial 2-year period ending December 31, 2009. Municipal
and cooperative electric utilities are also currently pursuing energy efficiency programs. To
estimate the effects of these actions, APSC authorized utility spending is extrapolated statewide
as cooperative and municipal program data was not available. Using the TWG assumption of
$34/MWh and $5.00/BBtu for electric and gas efficiency costs, estimated statewide electric
efficiency deployment in 2009 is 181 GWh of electricity and 1,200 BBtu of natural gas. These
G-57

actions are expected to reduce Arkansas GHG emissions by .2 MMtCO2e in 2009 using the RCI
TWG CO2 methodology. These estimates assume that utilities’ regulated by APSC account for
three quarters of electricity sold in the state and program spending is split equally between
electricity and natural gas. The electricity reduction is removed from RCI-2b, and the natural gas
reduction is split into thirds and is removed equally from RCI-1, RCI-4a, and RCI-4b.

ES-2. Technology Research & Development

Policy Description
Research and development (R&D) funding can be targeted toward a particular technology or
group of technologies as part of a state initiative to build an industry around that technology in
the state, and/or to set the stage for adoption of the technology for use in the state. For example,
an agency can be established with a mission to help develop and deploy energy storage
technologies. R&D funding can also be made available to any renewable or other advanced
technology through an open bidding procedure (i.e., driven by bids received rather than by a
focused strategy to develop a particular technology). Funding can also be given for
demonstration projects to help commercialize technologies that have already been developed, but
are not yet in widespread use. Finally, funding can be targeted to increase collaboration among
existing institutions in Arkansas for R&D.
States can undertake initiatives focused on developing, promoting, and/or implementing one or
more specific fossil fuel or nuclear technologies that show promise for reducing GHG emissions.
Technologies could include, among others, carbon capture and storage (to sequester carbon
dioxide [CO2] emissions from power plants, oil and gas operations, and/or refineries); biomass
blending in coal power plants; and implementation of equipment in oil and gas operations that
increases efficiency and reduces losses (e.g., remote sensors of leaks).
Policies to encourage CO2 capture and storage or reuse (CCSR) could include a state agency or
department within an existing agency tasked with promoting CCSR, evaluation studies to
identify geologically sound reservoirs, R&D funding to improve CCSR technologies, and/or
financial incentives or mandates to capture and store carbon or to capture and reuse it.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Identify the likely funding mechanisms and policy tools that would provide further stimulus
for the development of new, reasonable-cost, low- and zero-GHG-emitting electricity
generation in Arkansas.
!

Complete a detailed and comprehensive evaluation study for renewable energy potential in
Arkansas.

!

Complete a least one high-visibility R&D demonstration to showcase alternative energies.

Timing: Establish funding in the 2009 legislative session. Finish study within two years. Issue
first request for proposals as soon a possible after obtaining legislative approval.
Parties Involved: State government, voluntary private and public partners.

ES-3a. Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)

Policy Description
A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requires utilities to supply a certain, generally fixed
percentage of electricity from an eligible renewable energy source(s). An environmental
portfolio standard expands that notion to include energy efficiency or other GHG emissionreducing technologies as an eligible resource. About 20 states currently have an RPS in place. In
some cases, utilities can also meet their portfolio requirements by purchasing Renewable Energy
Certificates from eligible renewable energy projects.
The application of an RPS in Arkansas is provisional. That is, ES-3b (Renewable Energy Feed-In
Tariff [REFIT]) is the primary recommendation for achieving greater penetration of renewable
energy. However, if certain goals of the REFIT recommendation are not achieved, the RPS
would go into effect, as per the threshold requirements discussed below.
Policy Design
Goal: The aim of an RPS is for each investor-owned and public utility to provide 15% of its load
using renewable energy resources.
Timing: Beginning in 2015.
Parties Involved: Investor-owned utilities, electric cooperatives, state government.
Other: The RPS recommendation is provisional, depending on the success of the REFIT
recommendation, the primary policy for achieving greater penetration of renewable energy in
Arkansas. The time frame for which the RPS would be triggered would follow the goals of ES3b. For example, ES-3b states that by 2015, Arkansas will produce 500 megawatts (MW) of
renewable energy. If the REFIT recommendation has not achieved 250 MW (half of the 2015
goal) by 2012, an RPS mandate will go into effect to ensure the 500-MW target is reached by
2015.
Implementation Mechanisms
The Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) will evaluate the potential cost impact on
consumers. For utilities subject to the authority of the APSC, the APSC should review any
allocations that are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate
cross-subsidization between classes of consumers. For utilities (e.g., municipal utilities) that are
not subject to the authority of the APSC, the governing body for the utility should review any
allocations that are subsidies coming from ratepayers, and ensure that there is not inappropriate
cross-subsidization between classes of consumers.

Quantification Methods:
See Annex 1 for the overall approach to the quantification of this and all other ES
recommendations.
This policy recommendation requires that utilities and other load-serving entities supply a
certain, generally fixed, percentage of electricity from eligible (e.g., low-GHG-emitting)
renewable energy sources. The TWG has made the following key assumptions for the analysis of
this recommendation:
! One reference scenario is modeled, assuming the Hempstead plant is built.
!

The start year for the policy recommendation is 2015.

!

Incremental renewable energy generation associated with the implementation of the RPS
displaces marginal generation comprising 90% natural gas-fired and 10% coal-fired
generation in each year new renewable capacity comes on line.

H-7

!

The mix of new renewable resources to come on line would be modeled after the results of
the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration's Assumptions to the
Annual Energy Outlook 2007 for the Southwest Power Pool region, assumed to be a
reasonable proxy for a least-cost renewable energy mix.

!

15% of all new wind capacity is reserved to be installed in high-wind resource areas in
Arkansas; the balance is installed in high-wind resource areas in the surrounding region.

!

Additional transmission capacity is built to accommodate all new wind energy resources.

!

The capacity credit for intermittent renewables (i.e., wind and solar photovoltaic [PV]) is
15%. For these intermittent resources, spinning reserve is provided in the form of natural gasfired combustion turbines.

!

The cost of new renewables is compared to the average avoided cost of electricity expansion
in Arkansas, as obtained from the RCI TWG (i.e., $58.3/MWh).

Figure H-3a-1 summarizes the impact of ES-3a on in-state gross generation. The incremental
effect of the RPS by 2025 is about 7,984 gigawatt-hours (GWh), with 69% of this amount
coming from out-of-state wind, 12% from in-state wind, 17% from biomass, and 2% from solar
PVs. Displaced coal-fired generation in 2025 is 798 GWh, and natural gas-fired generation is
7,185 GWh.

Cost savings are associated with avoided capital, fuel, and operation and maintenance (O&M)
costs. Incremental costs are associated with the capital, transmission, variable and fixed O&M,
and fuel costs associated with the RPS. The annual product of real levelized costs and displaced
generation is an estimate of the annual costs. The net present value (NPV) of the costs is $0.72
billion over the same period (2005$). The recommendation's cost-effectiveness is calculated as
the quotient of the net present value (NPV) and cumulative GHG emission reductions. It is
$32.8/tCO2e (2005$) (i.e., $0.72 billion divided by 21.9 MMtCO2e and multiplied by a
conversion factor of 1,000).

Key Uncertainties
The costs of renewable energy technologies, the price forecast for natural gas and coal delivered

both reference scenarios.
Additional Benefits and Costs
None cited.
Feasibility Issues
The functioning of the electric transmission network is somewhat analogous to the nation’s
system of roadways. High-voltage transmission lines were originally constructed to efficiently
transport power from local utility bulk power plants, usually constructed in nearby rural areas, to
large load centers in metropolitan areas. This has evolved over time to building transmission to
even more remote baseload generation and interconnecting with neighboring utilities to take
advantage of jointly owned generating stations and emergency assistance. Central station wind
and solar have significant cost advantages over distributed resources, but prime locations are
remote from Arkansas and in very rural areas without significant electric transmission
infrastructure. If regional and national bulk electric transmission lines (the equivalent of the
interstate highway system) are not built, access to significant and cost-effective renewable

H-11

generation will be obstructed, and goals for such must be scaled back to levels reliably and
economically achievable.
Status of Group Approval
Complete.
Level of Group Support
Majority (10 objections).
Barriers to Consensus
Ten of the 21 GCGW members present objected to this policy because (1) they do not agree with
the mandatory requirement of the RPS if the REFIT policy has not achieved 250 MW (half of the
2015 goal) of renewables by 2012, and (2) the policy has a high associated cost.

H-12

ES-3b. Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT)

Policy Description
Renewable Energy Feed-In Tariff (REFIT) is a policy recommendation that provides guaranteed
above-market rates for a given period to entities that install qualifying sources of renewable
energy and sell energy back to the grid. The higher rate helps overcome the cost disadvantages of
renewable energy sources and may be set at different levels for the various forms of renewable
power generation. Utilities would be able to recover the cost of the program, plus a reasonable
profit, from their ratepayer base. In cases where the entity does not have the capital available to
finance the renewable energy installation, it can display this utility guarantee to a financial
institute to aid in obtaining a loan for the purchase price of the installation.
“Renewable energy” is defined as energy from wind, solar (to include at least PVs and
concentrating solar), advanced biomass (i.e., biomass other than corn-based ethanol),
geothermal, and new hydroelectric installations, including additional generated power at existing
installations. This definition puts no restriction on the size of a qualifying facility. The size of the
installation should be taken into account by a sliding payment scale that gives smaller perkilowatt-hour (kWh) payments to larger facilities (facilities having a larger maximum power
output).
Some observers contend that Arkansas has significant amounts of such electricity-producing new
renewable energy resources, while others contend that these resources exist only in insignificant
amounts. It is partly for this reason that a mandated RPS is controversial and, for utilities, risky.
By avoiding mandates, the REFIT avoids these controversies and risks, while maximizing
investments in renewable energy sources. This type of program was pioneered by Germany
during 1990–2000, and is behind the large growth in wind power in Spain, Germany, and
Denmark. These countries now get 9%, 5%, and 20% of their electricity, respectively, from
wind, and are beginning to branch out into solar PV and other forms of renewable electricity.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Require utilities to purchase electricity from individuals, municipal or local governments, or
companies that own qualifying renewable energy facilities by means of a REFIT. The REFIT
will stipulate government-set, above-market electricity rates and for a guaranteed 20-year
period, for renewable electricity from approved sources. The rates should be high enough to
provide an incentive for individuals or companies to install renewable energy systems.
!

Establish a program that will encourage financing for such individuals or companies to install
approved renewable electricity sources, and to allow utilities to recover the cost of this
program (plus a reasonable profit) from their ratepayer base.

!

Approved forms of renewable energy should include at least wind and solar, where “solar”
should include at least PV and solar-thermal (often called “concentrating solar”). The abovemarket guaranteed rate is expected to be different for different forms of renewable energy.

H-13

The REFIT can be controlled by putting a limit on ratepayer impact, whereby an increase of 5%
or less in rates is dedicated to the program.
Timing: Such a program should not take long to establish and could be in operation by perhaps
2010. It is difficult to say how many individuals or firms will want to take advantage of this
incentive program, so it is difficult to predict the amount of electricity that might be generated
renewably. A reasonable goal (which is not to be construed as a mandate) might be 500 MW by
2015, with at least 20 MW going to wind and 20 MW going to solar. The program might be
expected to start small and to grow, depending on how viable wind and solar and other
renewable forms of electricity turn out to be in Arkansas.
Parties Involved: Investor-owned utilities, electric cooperatives, state government.
Implementation Mechanisms
For utilities subject to the authority of the APSC, the APSC should review any allocations that
are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate crosssubsidization between classes of consumers. For utilities (e.g., municipal utilities) that are not
subject to the authority of the APSC, the governing body for the utility should review any
allocations that are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate
cross-subsidization between classes of consumers.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Reductions in all GHG emissions from energy production and GHG emissions associated with
process operational emissions and energy consumption.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
This policy recommendation was analyzed relative to several plausible scenarios regarding the
efficacy of feed-in tariffs when applied to the Arkansas context. This was necessary insofar as
there is limited literature on the transferability of the German and Japanese experiences with the
use of feed-in tariffs for the stimulation of renewable energy development in other settings.
Following are three major assumptions regarding the transferability of the German and Japanese
experiences with the use of feed-in tariffs. They have:
! Half the efficacy of the German experience.
!

Three-fourths of the efficacy of the German experience.

!

One-to-one transferability of the German experience. This was the default assumption.

In addition to these assumptions, different trajectories in the penetrations of renewable energy
resulting in the application of the feed-in tariffs in Arkansas were assumed, as follows:
! Achieve the same level as the RPS (i.e., 15% of gross in-state electricity generation by 2025).

H-14

!

Achieve renewable energy penetration in 2025 consistent with a rate impact of less than 5%
of the projected retail electricity rate. This was the default assumption.

!

Achieve a greater level than the RPS (i.e., 25% of gross in-state electricity generation by
2025.

The above combination of scenarios and sensitivities results in a total of 18 sets of results for this
policy recommendation. However, only the results for the default assumptions for this
recommendation are provided in Table H-3b-1, below. The sections that follow describe the data
sources, quantification approach, and key assumptions used in the development of these results.

Quantification Methods:
See Annex H-1 for the overall approach to the quantification of this and all other energy supply
policy recommendations.
This is a policy recommendation to implement incentives available to residential, commercial,
and industrial electricity customers to install renewable energy technologies. The TWG has made
the following key assumptions for the analysis of this recommendation:
! One reference scenario is modeled, assuming the Hempstead plant is built.
!

The start year for the policy recommendation is 2015 (500 MW minimum renewable
capacity additions).

H-15

!

Incremental renewable energy generation associated with the implementation of the feed-in
tariff displaces marginal generation comprising 90% natural gas-fired and 10% coal-fired
generation in each year new renewable capacity comes on line.

!

The mix of new renewable resources to come on line is assumed to be wind and solar PV due
to the fact that these resources were the ones for which data were available for the German
experience.

!

All new wind capacity is installed at demand sites in high wind resource areas in Arkansas.

!

Additional transmission capacity will need to be built to accommodate new wind energy
generation in excess of that needed to satisfy installer demand.

!

No capacity credit for intermittent renewables is assumed (i.e., wind and solar PV), as the
recommendation focuses on demand-side installation outside utility planning protocols.

!

The cost of new renewable resources is compared to the average avoided cost of electricity
expansion in Arkansas, as obtained from the RCI TWG (i.e., $58.3/MWh). This value was
assumed to be applicable for all scenarios and sensitivities.

Cost savings are associated with avoided capital, fuel, and O&M costs. Incremental costs are
associated with the capital, transmission, variable and fixed O&M, and fuel costs associated with
the RPS. The annual product of real levelized costs and displaced generation is an estimate of the
annual costs. The sum of the annual costs and annual benefits provides an estimate of the net
costs of the feed-in tariff. The NPV of the costs is $0.51 billion over the 2015–2025 period
(2005$). The cost-effectiveness of the various runs is calculated as the quotient of the NPV and
cumulative GHG emission reduction and is equal to $41.7/MWh (2005$).

Assumed Cost and Performance Characteristics of New Capacity in Arkansas—These are
obtained from the various sources indicated earlier, and are summarized in Table H-3a-2.
Levelized Costs of New Renewable Capacity—These are computed using an annual inflation rate
of 2.5%, a real discount rate of 5%, an after-tax weighted cost of capital of 9%, and a levelization
period of 20 years, and are summarized in Table H-3a-3.
Levelized Costs for NGCT Used for Reliability Purposes—As noted earlier, NGCT units are not
assumed, given that much of the reliability needs are mitigated by the fact that these are demandside options that do not need transmission and distribution (T&D) for meeting customer demand.
Key Uncertainties
The costs of renewable energy technologies, the price forecast for natural gas and coal delivered
to regional power stations, the applicability of avoided costs over the planning period for both
reference scenarios, and the reliability needs for dispatchable power under a REFIT regime.
Additional Benefits and Costs
None cited.
Feasibility Issues
The functioning of the electric transmission network is somewhat analogous to the nation’s
system of roadways. High-voltage transmission lines were originally constructed to efficiently
transport power from local utility bulk power plants, usually constructed in nearby rural areas, to
large load centers in metropolitan areas. This has evolved over time to building transmission to
even more remote baseload generation and interconnecting with neighboring utilities to take

H-18

advantage of jointly owned generating stations and emergency assistance. Central station wind
and solar have significant cost advantages over distributed resources, but prime locations are
remote from Arkansas and in very rural areas without significant electric transmission
infrastructure. If regional and national bulk electric transmission lines (the equivalent of the
interstate highway system) are not built, access to significant and cost-effective renewable
generation will be obstructed, and goals for such must be scaled back to levels reliably and
economically achievable.
Status of Group Approval
Complete.
Level of Group Support
Super Majority (4 objections).
Barriers to Consensus
Four of the 21 GCGW members present objected to this policy because of its high cost, and they
believe an increase of 5% or less in rates is too high (the limit on ratepayer impact associated
with REFIT should be in the 1%–2% range at most).

H-19

ES-4. Grid-Based Renewable Energy Incentives and/or Barrier Removal

Policy Description
Arkansas should enact tax incentives and innovative financing programs for residential and
commercial utility users who develop or apply successful renewable energy systems. The tax and
loan incentives should be proportional to the amount of renewable energy they are using, with
the greatest incentives for those who use net metering and return energy to the grid for use by
other utility customers. The Legislative Council, the Arkansas Department of Finance and
Revenue, the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, the Arkansas Department of
Environmental Quality, and the Arkansas Science and Technology Authority, in coordination
with the GCGW and the appropriate legislative leaders, should research model programs in other
states and countries and make recommendations on specific policies in time for the next
legislative session. In addition, pilot and demonstration programs should be established to
demonstrate the effectiveness of these policies as they are implemented. Alternative sources of
funding, including foundations, utility companies, and others, should be sought to supplement
state revenue for these policies.
This policy recommendation reflects financial incentives to encourage investment in renewable
energy resources. Examples include: (1) direct subsidies for purchasing/selling renewable
technologies, (2) tax credits or exemptions for purchasing renewable technologies, (3) tax credits
for each kWh generated from a qualifying renewable facility, and (4) regulatory policies that
provide incentives and/or assurance of cost recovery for utilities that invest in central station
renewable energy systems. In addition, this recommendation would make it a priority for the
legislature, the APSC, and other relevant state agencies to identify and rectify barriers to the
development of renewable resources in the state.
Policy Design
Goals: The initial evaluation should include several different types of financial incentives to
represent the range of opportunities.
! Offer tax credits or other incentives of $1,500 per kW-equivalent for small solar PV, microhydro, and small wind.
!

Provide a subsidy to renewable energy generators of $0.01/kWh for electricity generated
from a renewable resource, unless that electricity is used to meet a federal, state, or voluntary
renewable energy standard.

!

Offer low-interest loans for feasible and desirable biomass generation that meets exemplary
environmental performance standards, with partial loan forgiveness for equipment that fails
to perform to standard.

Timing: Tax credits beginning in 2010 and subsidies beginning in 2015.
Parties Involved: All power producers operating qualifying facilities for incentives other than
tax credits, which would be available to any grid-connected customer.

ES-5. Approaches Benefiting From Regional Application

Policy Description
The primary goal of this policy recommendation is to establish a mechanism that will allow
Arkansas to adapt to and be prepared for a federally implemented cap-and-trade system and other
federal climate policy. A cap-and-trade system is a market mechanism by which GHG emissions
are limited or capped at a specified level, and those participating in the system are required to
hold permits for each unit of emissions. Through trading, participants with lower costs of
compliance can choose to overcomply and sell their additional reductions to participants for
whom compliance costs are higher. In this fashion, overall costs of compliance are lower than
they would otherwise be.

ES-6. Combined Heat and Power

Policy Description
Combined heat and power (CHP) refers to any system that simultaneously or sequentially
generates electric energy and utilizes the thermal energy that is normally wasted. The recovered
thermal energy can be used for industrial process steam, space heating, hot water, air
conditioning, water cooling, product drying, or nearly any other thermal energy need in the
commercial and industrial sectors. The end result is significantly increased efficiency over
generating electric and thermal energy separately. In fact, many CHP systems are capable of an
overall efficiency of over 80%—double that of conventional systems. Another significant
advantage is the reduced T&D losses associated with centralized power generation.
Policy Design
Reports from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) show 16 distributed generation (DG)
units in Arkansas with a capacity of 1–20 MW with a combined capacity of 126 MW. Annual
energy production from these facilities exceeds 785 GWh, equivalent to less than 2% of retail
energy sales. Though no assessment of the thermal efficiency is available, the units operate at a
relatively high capacity factor, exceeding 70%. According to an assessment by the Electric
Power Research Institute, the market adoption of CHP has been limited due to a confluence of
barriers, including a lack of compelling savings and economics for end users and a lack of high
enough margins for utility or third-party business models.
The combination of higher natural gas prices, the potential increased cost of all fuel-based
energy production due to CO2 restrictions, impediments to expanding the use of coal-based
generation, the escalating costs for T&D facilities, and dramatic increases in the capital cost for
all bulk power supply options will enhance the savings and economics for CHP. In addition to
this natural market incentive for CHP, this policy recommendation proposes incentives in the
form of payments to utilities, industries, individuals, or other entities that reduce CO2 emissions
by installing new CHP systems either to capture and use waste heat from electric power plants,
or to generate electricity from waste heat produced in industrial processes. The incentives would
be paid on a per-ton basis for each ton of saved CO2, and would be accompanied by a 20-year
guarantee of payment for future avoided CO2 emissions, paid on a declining scale to phase out in
20 years (see example below under “Goals”). The purpose of the incentives is to encourage small
generating facilities to be located next to industries that can use their waste heat, to encourage
industries that use process heat to use their waste heat to generate electricity or for other lowertemperature heating applications, and to encourage industries using process heat to locate their
operations close enough to existing generating facilities so that they can use the waste heat from
those facilities.
Funding for the incentives should come from the utility’s customer base, overseen by the APSC,
or from tax money appropriated by the legislature.

H-24

The state should expand on EIA survey data to determine the number of existing DG projects
that have CHP potential, assessing the energy reductions achievable with forecasted escalating
energy costs.
Goals: Reduce use of fossil fuel from industrial sources through the employment of new CHP
applications incentivized by payments for CO2 emission reductions. A typical incentive might be
a 20-year guaranteed payment of $40 per ton of avoided CO2, with the amount to decline in
increments over time, phasing out at the end of 20 years. For example, the amount might decline
to $30 per ton after 5 years, $20 per ton after 10 years, and $10 per ton after 15 years. It is hoped
that this would reduce the direct use of natural gas in Arkansas by 10%, and would also increase
the average energy efficiency of electric power plants by 10% (e.g., from 40% to 50%).
Timing: The incentives should be introduced right away, beginning in 2010.
Parties Involved: State government and regulators, electric utilities, and renewable energy and
CHP industry.
Implementation Mechanisms
For utilities subject to the authority of the APSC, the APSC should review any allocations that
are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate crosssubsidization between classes of consumers. For utilities (e.g., municipal utilities) that are not
subject to the authority of the APSC, the governing body for the utility should review any
allocations that are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate
cross-subsidization between classes of consumers.

Quantification Methods:
See Annex H-1 for the overall approach to the quantification of this and all other energy supply
recommendations.
This policy recommendation requires increased used of highly efficient CHP facilities in
Arkansas. The TWG is making the following key assumptions for the analysis of this
recommendation:
! One reference scenario is modeled, assuming the Hempstead plant is built.
!

The start year for the policy recommendation is 2013.

!

Incremental electricity generation provided to the grid from new CHP systems displaces
marginal generation comprising 90% natural gas-fired and 10% coal-fired generation in each
year new renewable capacity comes on line.

Regarding incremental CHP capacity and corresponding electricity generation, the following
capacity trajectory in Figure H-6-1 was assumed based on a recent study by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency regarding the maximum achievable potential of CHP systems
in Arkansas.

Figure H-6-2 summarizes the incremental impact of CHP on gross generation. The incremental
effect of CHP by 2025 is about 7,574 GWh, with 83% of this amount coming from natural gas
and the balance from biomass. After accounting for avoided T&D losses, displaced coal-fired
generation in 2025 is 1,055 GWh, and natural gas-fired generation is 9,494 GWh.

Cost savings are associated with avoided capital, fuel, and O&M costs. Incremental costs are
associated with the capital, transmission, variable and fixed O&M, and fuel costs associated with
new CHP facilities. The annual product of real levelized costs and displaced generation is an
estimate of the annual costs. The sum of the annual costs and annual benefits provides an
estimate of the net costs of the policy recommendation. The NPV of the costs is $0.89 billion
over the 2015–2025 period (2005$). The recommendation's cost-effectiveness is calculated as
the quotient of the NPV and cumulative GHG emission reductions and is $44.3/tCO2e (2005$)
(i.e., $0.89 billion divided by 20.0 MMtCO2e and multiplied by a conversion factor of 1,000).

ES-7. Geological Underground Sequestration for New Plants

Policy Description
This policy refers to the capture of CO2 from fossil fuel-fired power plant emissions and its
sequestration in geologic formations, including oil and gas reservoirs, coal seams that cannot be
mined, and deep saline reservoirs. Broadly, three different types of technologies exist: postcombustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion. After capture, the CO2 must be
transported to suitable storage sites; this is often accomplished via pipeline.
Policy Design
This policy affects all new coal-fired power plants, both those that are currently under
construction and those that have not yet received full approval for construction in Arkansas.
Plants currently under construction (including the Plum Point plant) should install and employ
post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) as soon after the plant's opening as the
technology becomes available. Plants that have not yet received full approval for construction
(including the Hempstead plant) should employ CCS as soon as they begin operations. All other
new coal-fired generating plants should employ state-of-the-art pre-combustion CCS as soon as
they begin operations.
This policy implies that, except for the already-permitted Plum Point plant, there will be no new
coal-fired generating plants in Arkansas until sequestration is ready. Until that time, the
electricity that would have been generated by new plants should be replaced with expanded
energy efficiency, renewable energy, and, as a last resort, natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC)
technology.
Goals: Capture 80%–90% of CO2 emissions from new power plants.
Timing: Reductions achieved beginning in 2020.
Parties Involved: Large, new, coal-fired power plants.

!

In place of the 2012 date for bringing the Hempstead plant on line, introduce expanded
demand-side energy efficiency, renewable energy (wind), and NGCC units to replace the
power that would have been generated by the Hempstead plant.

!

In 2020, build the Hempstead plant (pulverized coal) with post-combustion (i.e., chemical
absorption with monethanolamine) CCS technology and in-state sequestration. Export power
generated to SPP and SERC regions.

!

In 2020, add post-combustion CCS technology (i.e., chemical absorption with
monoethanolamine) and in-state sequestration to the Plum Point plant.

The results for the analysis of the above scenario are summarized in Table H-7-1. The sections
that follow describe the data sources, quantification approach, and key assumptions used in the
development of these results.

annual generation for electric production facilities in Arkansas.

Quantification Methods:
Regarding in-state gross generation, the impact of this recommendation on the Plum Point and
Hempstead plants is summarized in Figure H-7-1. The incremental effect of the recommendation
on the Plum Point plant shows that during 2020–2025, the period post-combustion carbon
capture technology is operational, generation decreases by about 1,800 GWh due to derating
associated with the retrofit. During 2012–2019, a combination of demand-side efficiency, wind,
and NGCC generation are added to compensate for the deferral of the online year for the
Hempstead plant. These resources are assumed to continue in the 2020–2025 period, when the

H-31

Hempstead plant comes on line. During this period, annual generation for the Hempstead plant is
2,326 GWh, after accounting for derating from the installation of post-combustion carbon
capture technology.

Regarding CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emission reductions, the impact of this policy
recommendation is summarized in Figure H-7-2 on a production basis. By 2025 the policy
results in annual emission reductions of about 5.9 MMtCO2e. This is made up of reductions of
3.33 MMtCO2e (from adding carbon capture to the Plum Point plant), reductions of about 3
MMtCO2e (from energy efficiency, wind, and natural gas-fired generation to offset Hempstead
generation), and an increase of 0.6 MMtCO2e (from additional emissions associated with
construction of the Hempstead plant, whose generation is exported. On a cumulative basis, the
recommendation leads to reductions of 56.5 MMtCO2e.

CCS = carbon capture and storage; GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent; NGCC = natural gas combined cycle.

Cost savings are associated with avoided capital, fuel, and O&M costs for coal and natural gas
facilities from the additional demand-side efficiency measures. Incremental costs are associated
with capital, transmission, variable and fixed O&M, and fuel costs associated with the new wind,
NGCC stations, and CCS technology. The annual product of real levelized costs and displaced
generation is an estimate of the annual costs. The sum of the annual costs and annual benefits
provides an estimate of the net costs of the policy recommendation. The NPV of the costs is $1.8
billion over the 2012–2025 period (2005$). The policy's cost-effectiveness is calculated as the
quotient of the NPV and cumulative GHG emission reductions. For the central estimate of cost
and performance, it is $31.9/tCO2e (2005$) (i.e., $1.8 billion divided by 56.5 MMt and
multiplied by a conversion factor of 1,000).

Level of Group Support
Majority (10 objections).
Barriers to Consensus
Ten of the 21 GCGW members present objected to this policy because it recommends that
construction of the Hempstead (Turk) coal plant be delayed until 2020, the Hempstead plant will
be the cleanest and most efficient coal plant built to date, it is uncertain if CCS technology can
be demonstrated to be commercially viable and cost-effective by 2020, potential cost issues are
associated with relying on renewables and other resources that may not be able to fulfill baseload
demand that otherwise would be fulfilled by a coal plant like Hempstead, and the APSC is

H-34

requiring the Southwestern Electric Power Company to review annually all carbon sequestration
and capture technologies as available in the future.
One GCGW member objected on the basis that this would be de facto retroactive policymaking.
Industry has a right to presume that the rules will not change in midstream on projects once they
are begun. If the Commission wants to draw a line in the sand on the issue of coal-fired power
plants, that must be done in the future and must not impact plants in which significant
investments have already been made under a current policy structure.

ES-8. Transmission System Upgrades

Policy Description
Measures to improve transmission systems to reduce bottlenecks and enhance throughput may be
required to satisfy long-term electricity demands, improve the efficiency of operations, and allow
for delivery of diverse and renewable energy sources located outside of the state. Opportunities
may exist to substantially increase transmission line carrying capacity through the
implementation of new construction and retrofit activities on the transmission grid, including
incorporating advanced composite conductor technologies, capacitance technologies, and grid
management software. Siting new transmission lines can be a difficult process, given their cost
and their local impact on the environment and on the use, enjoyment, and value of property.
Policy Design
A primary goal of this policy recommendation can be to provide incentives to utilities to upgrade
existing transmission systems and reduce barriers to siting new transmission lines to provide
access to new energy sources often far from existing transmission lines and load centers.
Another goal of this policy can be to reduce T&D line losses. Utilities use a variety of
components throughout the T&D system to manage losses. Increasing the efficiency of these
components can further reduce losses and associated GHG emissions. For example, Vermont
offers a rebate to encourage the installation of energy-efficient transformers. Regulations,
incentives, and/or support programs can be applied to achieve greater efficiency of T&D system
components.
A third goal can be the general distribution of generation support (interconnection rules, net
metering, etc.). Well-designed interconnection rules will ensure that distributed power products
meet minimum requirements for performance, safety, and maintenance, while at the same time
significantly advance the commercialization of these technologies.
Goals:
! Achieve a 5% effective improvement in energy efficiency through reduced T&D system
losses (i.e., losses reduced from 6.5% to 6.2%).
!

Achieve a 5% increase in renewable energy sources through improved transmission access to
these sources.

Timing: Phased in, beginning in 2013, with the established goal achieved by 2018.
Parties Involved: APSC, investor-owned utilities, generation and transmission electric
cooperatives, municipalities, representatives of environmental and economic development
organizations, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and transmission owners and
operators.

Feasibility Issues
The functioning of the electric transmission network is somewhat analogous to the nation’s
system of roadways. High-voltage transmission lines were originally constructed to efficiently
transport power from local utility bulk power plants, usually constructed in nearby rural areas, to
large load centers in metropolitan areas. This has evolved over time to building transmission to
even more remote baseload generation, and interconnecting with neighboring utilities to take
advantage of jointly owned generating stations and emergency assistance. Central station wind
and solar have significant cost advantages over distributed resources, but prime locations are
remote from Arkansas and in very rural areas without significant electric transmission
infrastructure. If regional and national bulk electric transmission lines (the equivalent of the
interstate highway system) are not built, access to significant and cost-effective renewable
generation will be obstructed, and goals for such must be scaled back to levels reliably and
economically achievable.

ES-9. Nuclear Power

Policy Description
Nuclear power has historically been a low-GHG source of electric power. However, no new
nuclear power plants have come on line in the United States since 1996 due to high capital costs.
Long-term disposal of nuclear waste and public safety are public policy concerns with nuclear
power. With the national pricing of the GHG cost of fossil fuel generation, with either a cap-andtrade system or a carbon tax, nuclear power will be more cost-competitive.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 included provisions encouraging the construction of new nuclear
units. There are currently nine applications for a new plant on file with the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC). The one nearest to Arkansas is adjacent to the existing Grand Gulf unit in
Port Gibson, Mississippi; it has been accepted for docketing by the NRC. As new nuclear power
plants come on line in the future in the Arkansas region, they will offer Arkansas electric utilities
an alternative to the construction of fossil fuel generation units.
Nuclear plant relicensing allows an existing plant to extend the life of the facility for 20 years
past its original 40-year license terms. The two existing nuclear units in Arkansas have already
completed this process. Thus, no further reductions in current GHG emissions can be achieved
through the relicensing process.
Policy Design
Given the uncertainty of when new nuclear generating capacity will be on line in this region, the
GCGW does not recommend a reduction goal achievable with this action. However, the GCGW
does go on record supporting the construction of new nuclear power plants.
Goal: One new 1,500-MW nuclear plant operating at 95% capacity factor.
Timing: Operational in 2020.
Parties Involved: APSC.

Quantification Methods:
See Annex H-1 for the overall approach to the quantification of this and all other energy supply
recommendations.
The analysis of this policy recommendation examines the installation a one nuclear power station
during the planning period. The following key assumptions were used for the analysis of this
recommendation:
! One reference scenario is modeled, assuming the Hempstead plant is built.
!

The start year for the policy recommendation is 2020.

H-40

!

Incremental renewable energy generation associated with the installation of the nuclear
station displaces 80% coal-fired and 20% natural gas-fired generation in each year the
nuclear station is operational.

!

The cost of new nuclear power is compared to the average avoided cost of electricity
expansion in Arkansas, as obtained from the RCI TWG (i.e., $58.3/MWh).

!

Full fuel-cycle GHG emissions are considered.

!

Three sensitivities are considered for cost and performance assumptions for nuclear stations,
low, mid, and high estimates. The mid estimate is the default assumption.

Figure H-9-1 summarizes the impact of this policy recommendation on in-state gross generation.
The incremental effect by 2025 is an additional 11,169 GWh of new nuclear generation over the
period 2020–2025, leading to reductions of 8,935 GWh of coal-fired generation and 2,234 GWh
of natural gas-fired generation.

Figure H-9-2 summarizes the impact of the recommendation on CO2e emission reductions across
the full fuel cycle. The annual effect of the recommendation by 2025 results in about a 9.82
MMtCO2e emission reduction across the full fuel cycle. This is made up of reductions of 8.93
MMtCO2e from less coal-fired generation, reductions of 0.93 MMtCO2e from less natural gasfired generation associated with domestic supplies of natural gas, and an increase of 0.04
MMtCO2e from upstream emissions associated with nuclear power generation. On a cumulative
basis, the recommendation leads to emission reductions of 8.9 MMtCO2e.

Cost savings are associated with avoided capital, fuel, and O&M costs for coal and natural gas
facilities. Incremental costs are associated with the capital, transmission, variable and fixed
O&M, and fuel costs associated with the new nuclear station. The annual product of real
levelized costs and displaced generation is an estimate of the annual costs. The sum of the annual
costs and annual benefits provides an estimate of the net costs of the recommendation. For the
central estimate of cost and performance, the NPV of the costs is $1.57 billion over the 2020–
2025 period (2005$). The recommendation's cost-effectiveness is calculated as the quotient of
the NPV and cumulative GHG emission reductions. For the central estimate of cost and
performance, it is $26.7/tCO2e (2005$) (i.e., $1.57 billion divided by 58.9 MMtCO2e and
multiplied by a conversion factor of 1,000).

ES-10. Carbon Tax

Policy Description
The primary goal of this policy recommendation is to establish a mechanism that will allow
Arkansas to adapt to and be prepared for a federally implemented carbon tax and other federal
climate policies.
A carbon tax sets a fee, or tax, for the release of carbon to the atmosphere. It does not set a limit,
reduce, or otherwise control the tons of carbon released. The tax raises the cost of carbon-based
emissions and, therefore, encourages investment in low-carbon or no-carbon alternatives. It also
generates revenue for the government, which could be directed toward energy efficiency, the
development and use of renewable energy, climate change adaptation investments, and other
measures to mitigate or address the impacts of climate change. Many proposals also have options
to rebate the tax back to the ratepayer, particularly low-income ratepayers. A carbon tax could be
implemented as a tax on fossil fuels according to the amount of CO2 emitted by their
combustion. One of the benefits is that the tax can be more easily applied across all sectors. To
achieve the stated goal, the amount of the tax must be high enough to trigger financial and
behavioral decisions toward conservation or a shift to lower-emitting fuels.
Several examples exist where carbon taxes have been implemented. In 1990, Finland became the
first country to adopt a carbon tax, setting its level at about $1.45 per metric ton of CO2, which
was raised to $8.34 in 1995. Other countries, such as Denmark, Holland, and Sweden, followed
suit. In North America, several examples exist. In November 2006, Boulder, Colorado, passed
the first-ever municipal "carbon tax," a tax on electricity consumption (utility bills) that funds
programs by the City of Boulder to reduce GHG emissions. In February 2008, British Columbia
announced its intention to implement a $10/metric ton carbon tax beginning in July 2008. And in
May 2008, the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which covers nine counties in the
San Francisco Bay Area, passed a carbon tax of 4.4 cents per metric ton.
Additionally, many businesses and others have opted for what amounts to voluntary carbon taxes
through participation in voluntary offsetting programs, such as Native Energy and TerraPass. For
example, many online travel companies give customers the option of paying into these programs
to offset the carbon costs of their travel. Such a program could be designed in Arkansas with
utility bills to help implement many of the carbon capture projects discussed elsewhere in this
report.
Policy Design
!

Arkansas should only consider carbon tax programs that are national in scope, and in
conjunction with other carbon tax and “cap-and-trade” programs that are proposed. The state
should opt for national programs that use revenue sharing back to state government for
purposes of implementing state initiatives on global warming. The state should promote a
national carbon tax that does not put Arkansas at a competitive disadvantage with other
states.

H-46

!

Arkansas should make the cost of inefficient or higher CO2-emitting activities more
expensive than alternatives, thereby creating a financial incentive to discourage activities that
result in CO2 emissions. The amount of revenue that the carbon tax generates annually
should depend on the facilities subject to the tax. The amount of the tax should be high
enough to contribute to the reduction targets specified in a statute. From a competitive
perspective, one advantage of a carbon tax is that it is constant and predictable, making a
business case more stable than some alternatives.

!

A carbon tax should include options to rebate the tax back to the ratepayer, thus creating a
true cost of carbon but keeping ratepayers from paying more on their utility bills. This should
include rebates on income and payroll taxes, particularly for low-income ratepayers.

!

Voluntary carbon offset programs should be established in Arkansas through utility bills and
other mechanisms.

Goals:
! Integrate a carbon tax program in correlation with a national cap-and-trade system.
!

Work with surrounding states to establish a market-base value and standard that include
Arkansas-specific opportunities based on economic and environmental benefits.

!

Integrate a low-income credit initiative that focuses on efficiency.

!

Establish a program that will easily allow Arkansas to adapt to a federal cap-and-trade
system.

!

Establish a voluntary carbon offset program in Arkansas.

Timing: Beginning in 2009 and the system in place by late 2010, depending on the status of
efforts at the national level.
Parties Involved: All entities included in all other Arkansas climate change processes.
Other: None cited.
Implementation Mechanisms
A carbon tax is both an incentive mechanism and a revenue-raising instrument. The tax should
be structured in such a way as to shift the tax burden away from low-income households. This
can be done by recycling the revenue back into the economy through corresponding reductions in
personal income taxes or by altering the rate recovery regulations for electricity use.
Another option would be to create a voluntary check-off program on utility bills that would
account for carbon tax costs of household bills, giving customers the option of offsetting it with a
Native Energy or TerraPass type of program, only inside Arkansas. The state should work with
the APSC and public utilities, and other stakeholders, in establishing such a voluntary program.
The state of Arkansas should work with the Arkansas congressional delegation and other parties
on designing and implementing a carbon tax on a national level, working in conjunction with
other similar goals, such as a national cap-and-trade system.

Barriers to Consensus
Four of 21 GCGW members present objected to this recommendation in general, noting that this
is a national issue because imposing a carbon tax on a local market will cause Arkansas to be
uncompetitive with other states that do not choose to impose such a tax. One GCGW member
objected to the roll-back provision to adjust income and payroll taxes to offset any tax increase
associated with a carbon tax, believing this defeats the purpose of the tax, which is to provide an
incentive to decrease energy use.

ES-11. Efficiency Improvements and Repowering of Existing Plants

Policy Description
Improving efficiency at existing plants refers to increasing generation efficiency through such
improvements as more efficient boilers and turbines, improved control systems, or combinedcycle technology. This could also include switching to lower- or zero-emitting fuels at existing
plants, or new capacity additions. Policies to encourage efficiency improvements and repowering
of existing plants could include incentives and/or regulations. Although most economic
improvements have already been made, existing power plants should be encouraged to reach
specific energy efficiency goals before new plants are constructed.
Policy Design
Goals: Beginning in 2010, power plants should commence efficiency measures by improvement
in heat rates from existing levels. The policy will include a linear ramp-up schedule until a
maximum 10% efficiency obtainable is reached by 2020.
Timing: 5% improvement achieved by 2015; 10% achieved by 2020.
Parties Involved: Public/consumers, state and local governments, APSC.
Implementation Mechanisms
An estimated cost of carbon should be included to help drive further improvements in efficiency.
For utilities subject to the authority of the APSC, the APSC should review any allocations that
are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate crosssubsidization between classes of consumers. For utilities (e.g., municipal utilities) that are not
subject to the authority of the APSC, the governing body for the utility should review any
allocations that are subsidies coming from ratepayers and ensure that there is not inappropriate
cross-subsidization between classes of consumers.

Quantification Methods:
See Annex H-1 for the overall approach to the quantification of this and all other ES
recommendations.
This policy recommendation would promote the identification and pursuit of cost-effective
emission reductions from existing generating units by improving their operating efficiency and
fuel changes, or by adding carbon capture technology. It has been modeled as the repowering of
an existing pulverized coal station with NGCC technology. The TWG is making the following
key assumptions for the analysis of this recommendation:
! The start year for the policy recommendation is 2012.
!

One existing pulverized coal plant is repowered with an NGCC unit sized to provide
equivalent annual power generation

!

The coal station is be fully depreciated.

Figure H-11-1 presents the total generation associated with the repowered station.

There are incremental capital, O&M, and fuel costs from the NGCC unit and incremental fuel
and O&M savings from coal, as summarized in Figure H-11-3. The coal station was assumed to
be fully depreciated. The NPV of these annual costs is $1.6 billion over the 2012–2025 period
(2005$).

The recommendation's cost-effectiveness was calculated as the quotient of the NPV and
cumulative GHG emission reductions, or $49.3/tCO2e (2005$) (i.e., $1.6 billion divided by 31.8
MMtCO2e and multiplied by a conversion factor of 1,000).

Annex H-1
Overall Quantification Approach for Energy Supply Policy Recommendations
This Annex outlines key elements of the quantification approach the Center for Climate
Strategies (CCS) adopted for quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts and costs for those
policy recommendations that are considered amenable to quantification. The list of topics
addressed in the memo is summarized below.
A. Premises
The analysis was based on a number of key premises, as briefly outlined below.
!

CCS role: Unless a member of the Energy Supply (ES) Technical Work Group (TWG)
offered to undertake an analysis of any of the recommendations, CCS prepared the analysis
for review, comment, and revision by the TWG. Where an ES TWG member offered to
undertake the analysis of one or more recommendations, CCS would provide analytical
support (e.g., review and technical feedback) as needed.

!

Transparency: Data sources, methods, key assumptions, and key uncertainties are clearly
indicated for TWG review and comment.

!

Analytical approach: The approach adopted was of cost-effectiveness (and net present value
[NPV]) analysis, as widely applied to GHG mitigation policy recommendations. 1 Included
were direct, economic costs from the perspective of the state as whole (e.g., avoided costs of
electricity, rather than consumer electricity prices).

!

Bottom-up analysis: A bottom-up approach was adopted, which was amenable to
transparency and was capable of reflecting the costs (and cost savings) associated with
individual policy recommendations. This was chosen in contrast to macroeconomic analysis,
which aims to capture flows and interactions across all sectors of the economy. Potential
macroeconomic impacts, cost, or benefits that fall disproportionately on specific groups or
actors, as well external costs and benefits, should be noted qualitatively where studies or
other information are available.

B. Outputs
The analysis of policy recommendations was organized so as to produce the following results:
!

Net GHG reduction potential in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e)
using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 100-year global warming potential,
reported annually for the years 2015, 2020, and 2025, and cumulatively for the period 2010–
2025. Where significant additional GHG reductions or costs occur beyond the project period
as a direct result of actions taken during the project period, these were indicated as
appropriate.

1

For more discussion of various economic analysis approaches, see, e.g., Section 2.4 of: Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change. Climate Change 2007—Mitigation of Climate Change. Contribution of Working Group III to the
Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC. Available at: http://www.mnp.nl/ipcc/pages_media/AR4-chapters.html.

H-54

!

NPV cost (or cost savings) for the period 2010–2025 in 2007 constant dollars, using a 5%
real discount rate. 2 Positive numbers represent recommendations with net costs; negative
numbers represent recommendations with net cost savings.

!

Cost per metric ton of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) emissions reduced (or removed) in units of
$/tCO2e. This figure represents the NPV cost divided by the cumulative emission reductions,
both over the 2010–2025 period.

C. Methodology
As much as possible, the analysis preceded using simple spreadsheet modeling techniques in
which assumptions were transparent and readily accessible to any TWG member for review and
adjustment. To ensure consistent results across recommendations, common factors and
assumptions were used for such items as:
!

Electricity avoided costs and emissions—Common values ($/megawatt-hour [MWh] and
tCO2/MWh) were developed based on available studies. Each policy recommendation was
first analyzed individually and then addressed as part of an overall integrated analysis.

!

Fuel costs and projected escalation—Fuel cost estimates were based on common sources,
wherever possible. For example, fossil fuel price escalations were indexed to U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) projections, as indicated in DOE's most recent Annual Energy
Outlook.

!

Overlap with other TWGs—Some ES policy recommendations overlap with policy
recommendations analyzed by other Arkansas Governor's Commission on Global Warming
TWGs. The analysis for these recommendations took place in close coordination with the
assumptions and other inputs used in those TWGs.

!

Consumption-based approach—This approach aims to reflect the emissions associated with
electricity sources used to deliver electricity to consumers in Arkansas. It is distinct from a
production-basis approach, which considers the emissions from Arkansas power plants,
regardless of where the electricity is delivered.

D. Assumptions
As much as possible, the analysis sought to rely on data sources that are Arkansas-specific, and
that TWG members were in a good position to obtain and provide. The success of this approach
depended on how accessible the information was to TWG members and the timeliness in which
it was provided to the CCS analytical team.
Where Arkansas-specific information could not be readily obtained, the analysis relied on
published data from DOE, the National Laboratories, and other state climate change processes.
Specific assumptions that were needed to undertake the analysis are outlined below. Some of
these assumptions were obtained from non-Arkansas sources:
!

Avoided costs associated with the most recent electric capacity expansion plans in Arkansas;

!

New centralized renewable installation energy cost and performance assumptions;

2

Capital investments with lifetimes longer than 2025 are represented in terms of levelized or amortized costs, in
order to avoid “end effects.”
H-55

!

New centralized fossil power station cost and performance assumptions;

!

Fossil fuel price forecasts to electric generators through 2025 (i.e., distillate, residual oil,
natural gas, coal, biomass);

!

Any studies that provide spatial and temporal (as appropriate) quantitative estimates of
renewable resource potential in Arkansas (wind, solar, biomass, animal wastes);

!

Any studies that provide an indication of the technical and economic potential of combined
heat and power systems in Arkansas (both commercial and industrial applications);

!

Any studies that provide the costs associated with integrating large amounts of intermittent
renewable technologies into the system (where integration costs are expected to increase with
increasing amounts of intermittent capacity);

!

Any studies that examine alternative electric sector expansion plans in Arkansas that have
considered decoupling profits from sales, lost revenue adjustments, inverted block rates for
residential consumers, and/or use of carbon adders; and

!

Any studies that examine the installation and operating costs of integrated gasification
combined-cycle systems in Arkansas.

E. Cost Inclusion
Several types of costs were explicitly considered in the analysis, and several types were
excluded, as summarized below.
!

Sample costs included:
Capital costs levelized (amortized) where appropriate, e.g., for new energy supply
facilities and associated infrastructure;
! Operation and maintenance and other labor costs (or incremental costs relative to
standard practice);
! Fuel and material costs, e.g., for natural gas, electricity, biomass resources, water,
fertilizer, material use, electricity transmission and distribution; and
! Other direct costs (e.g., administrative) and other costs (where readily estimated), such as
the grid integration costs for renewable energy technologies.
!

!

Sample costs excluded:
External costs, such as the monetized environmental or social benefits/impacts (value of
damage by air pollutants on structures, crops, etc.), quality-of-life improvements, or
improved road safety or other health impacts and benefits;
! Energy security benefits; and
! Macroeconomic impacts related to the impact of reduced or increased consumer
spending, shifting of cost and benefits among actors in the economy.

Overlap Discussion:
The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced and the costs of a policy
recommendation within the Transportation and Land Use (TLU) sectors overlap with some of
the quantified benefits and costs of policy recommendations within other sectors. Where this
overlap has been determined to exist, the sector totals have been adjusted and each instance is
outlined below. Overlaps between recommendations within TLU have been accounted for within
the goal-setting process.
TLU-2 (Research and Development of Renewable Transportation Fuels) and TLU-3 (Advanced
Biofuels Development and Expansion) overlap with AFW-5 (Expanded Use of Liquid Biofuels).
This overlap was determined to be a partial overlap for the years 2010 to 2015 and a full overlap
for years after 2015. The policy overlap for both time periods has been accounted for by
adjusting the emission reductions and costs for AFW-5 by the proportion determined to be
included under the TLU analysis to avoid double counting.
Smart growth, transit, school siting, and school access are all closely related and interact directly
with one another. Because of this close interaction, three policy recommendations, TLU-4
(Smart Growth, Pedestrian and Bicycle Infrastructure), TLU-5 (Improve and Expand Transit
Service and Infrastructure), and TLU-6 (School and University Transportation Bundle) all
overlap to some extent with one another as each of these policy recommendations is
complimentary of one another. The complimentary nature of these policies did not, however,
impact their quantification. Each of these policies has been independently quantified for both
emissions reductions and costs.
To account for their complimentary nature, these three policy recommendations each identify
policies which would enhance their viability. TLU-4 specifically mentions the use of transit and
transit oriented development as part of the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reduction associated
with this policy recommendation, all of which is further discussed in TLU-5. TLU-5, discusses
the need to have appropriate land use policies in place for the success of transit, including
utilizing transit in higher density areas and the ability for municipalities to use eminent domain
to purchase the land necessary to develop transit and rail corridors, all of which could be
associated with the Smart Growth measures in TLU-4. TLU-6 discusses land use policies
necessary to be associated with school siting and the development of both pedestrian and
bicycling infrastructure (mentioned in TLU-4) as part of the safe routes to school program as a
method of reducing VMT. Although these three policies overlap concerning their
implementation and that each one would benefit from the implementation of the other, all of their
emissions reductions and costs were quantified separately and no overlap was identified as each
of these policies could be implemented separately.
No reductions from recent actions as identified in the policy recommendations have been made
to the TLU sector totals.

TLU-1. Study the Feasibility of Plug-In Electric Vehicles

Policy Description
Increasing the contribution of motor vehicles that are "plugged in” to the electrical grid may
reduce GHG emissions in Arkansas, depending on the degree to which power generation in the
state relies on fossil fuels and renewable fuels now and in the future. The goal of this policy
recommendation is to study a set of actions that would further evaluate the benefits and
feasibility of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), accelerate the deployment of a
commercially viable technology, remove barriers to more rapid adoption, create initial
incentives, and provide for the integration of PHEVs with other systems, including the power
supply and transportation systems.
Policy Design
Undertake a study that will review relevant completed, ongoing, and forthcoming studies,
including the 3-year national study (begun in 2007 and expected to be completed by 2010) by the
Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Ford Motor Company, and Southern California Edison
(SCE), which will develop and evaluate technical approaches for integrating PHEVs into the
nation's electric grid system. 1 Following the review of the relevant studies, assess the potential
effectiveness of implementing some or all of the items noted in the Implementation Mechanisms
section that follows.
Goals: Undertake a study that reviews relevant research, including the 3-year national study by
EPRI, Ford, and SCE. Thereafter, assess the effectiveness of the additional goals, actions, and
implementation timetables for other policy design options listed above.
Timing: As indicated above for each individual activity.
Parties Involved: Auto users, power utilities, auto dealers, others.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Assess the impacts of plug-in electric fleets on the state's power infrastructure at various
levels of market penetration, and identify technology and system requirements to maximize
use of off-peak and underutilized power resources. Engage power utilities as partners in the
study, and consider the future sources of power generation and their current and future
impacts on GHG emissions from PHEVs. Since automakers are preparing to introduce
PHEVs by 2010, and since it will be advantageous for car owners to plug in at night, utility
companies should be encouraged, and compensated for, installing "smart meters" allowing
time-of-day pricing for plug-in vehicles.

!

Provide funding for state and local government fleet conversions of standard hybrids to
PHEVs. In the future, set a goal for a certain number of conversions, and allocate funding to
reach that goal. Require that these vehicles be grid-aware, and include funding for equipment
to accomplish this task.

!

In the future, provide funding for school districts to acquire plug-in electric hybrid school
buses.

!

Commit the Arkansas state government to purchase PHEVs as they become commercially
available, allowing purchase at a price premium to reflect taking into account carbonreduction benefits and reductions in state expenditures on imported fuels.

!

Direct the state to provide rate recovery for utility research and development (R&D)
investments in pilot tests of vehicle-to-grid systems.

!

Fund the study of an assessment of electric vehicle charging needs in state parking facilities.

!

Develop and fund at least one vehicle-to-grid pilot involving a fleet of public plug-ins parked
in a state garage.

!

Fund a study by the state to identify Arkansas companies and economic sectors with potential
vehicle electrification markets, and develop a strategy to help Arkansas companies’ position
themselves for success in those markets.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
As described in the above implementation section. No other related programs identified at this
time.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Since this policy calls for a study, this policy is not quantified at this time. Following the
completion of the study, it is expected that better information will be available in order to
provide quantitative estimates of the potential impact of PHEVs on Arkansas.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
Not quantified at this time, since results will likely be available following completion of the
proposed study.
Key Uncertainties
The basic question as to whether motor vehicles powered by the electrical grid in Arkansas will
produce more or less GHG emissions on a life-cycle per-mile basis is unanswered. The study is
being recommended to provide information in an attempt to answer this question.
Additional Benefits and Costs
To be identified during the course of the study.

TLU-2. Research and Development of Renewable Transportation Fuels

Policy Description
This policy recommendation indicates support to assist in the development of low-carbon fuels
that are not yet commercially available in Arkansas, such as cellulosic ethanol. It will also
attempt to identify potential funding sources to conduct analyses to identify which renewable
fuels will provide the best options for Arkansas and its constituent regions and cities.
General support for research and development of advanced biofuels at the state's research
facilities, primarily the Arkansas State University System, is to be encouraged, and external
sources of research support should be identified.
Policy Design
Among other leading research institutions in Arkansas, the University of Arkansas’ Division of
Agriculture has expanded its involvement in research and education on biomass issues,
especially biofuels. New faculty members have been hired, and others have redirected their
efforts (e.g., plant breeding for alternative feedstock opportunities). The division dedicated the
recent higher education bond monies for capital improvements for new construction and
renovation of the Rice Research and Extension Center at Stuttgart. Two laboratories in that
facility have been designated as field biofuel laboratories. New resources are needed to expand
both the research and the agricultural extension output in these areas. Additional capacity is
needed to work on by-products and co-products (e.g., increased uses for glycerin, a by-product of
biodiesel production), new feedstocks, application of cellulosic technologies, marketing
strategies, and policy information support systems. Financial support is needed for field stations
to adapt to these changing crops in their research and education systems.
Goals: The goal of the policy should be to support R&D of renewable transportation fuels in
order to increase the capacity of the state university system to develop and produce such fuels
cost-effectively.
Timing: Legislation to be passed in the 2009 Regular Session, with funds to be available in
fiscal year (FY) 2009–2010.
Parties Involved: State of Arkansas, University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture, other state
research institutions.
Implementation Mechanisms
This policy will provide funding to promote in-state R&D related to biofuel/biodiesel
production, such as investigating the production of biofuels from Arkansas-based biomass
feedstocks (e.g., residues or by-products) from agricultural production (crop residues, chicken
fat, beef tallow), agricultural processing, forest or wood resources or production processes
(material not being utilized by pulp mill plants), or other cellulosic crops (e.g., switchgrass). It
could also include the reuse of food oils for use as biodiesel, possibly encouraging the production

I-6

of “homemade” biofuels (for example, by farmers for their farm equipment). 2 Such research
could be linked to life-cycle analyses of feedstock production and conversion.
The state should consider providing continuing annual funding for program enhancement for
biofuels and other biomass.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Arkansas State University has established a Center of Excellence on BioFuels and BioBased
Products. One research project is designed to develop an inexpensive supply of enzymes for
cellulosic biomass conversion. In addition, the environmental sustainability of various potential
energy crop systems will be evaluated based on soil quality, water quality, and water use in
addition to crop and fuel yields from the management of these energy crops. A third area will be
testing spark-ignition and compression-ignition engine categories to determine the impact on
emissions and engine performance when fueled by specific alternative fuels. We are
investigating the fuel production comparisons that suggest that algae have the potential to
produce up to 100,000 liters (L) of oil/hectare (ha), nearly 17 times the level of the highest
terrestrial crop, oil palm.3 Finally, we are investigating valuable new bio-based products from
protein and carbohydrate components present in low-value plant processing residues, such as
algae, rice bran, or other residues generated from the emerging Mid-South bioenergy industry.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Second-generation biofuels have the potential to significantly reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) and
other GHG emissions in comparison to existing petroleum-based fuels.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
Quantified as part of the analysis for TLU-3, Advanced Biofuels Development and Expansion.
Data Sources: Please see analysis for TLU-3.
Quantification Methods: Please see analysis for TLU-3.
Key Assumptions: Please see analysis for TLU-3.
Key Uncertainties
Universities are well suited for R&D activities; outcomes and timeframes can be uncertain.
Additional Benefits and Costs
R&D often has benefits that are difficult to predict before undertaking the R&D.

TLU 3. Advanced Biofuels Development and Expansion

Policy Description
Arkansas should adopt standards that require a certain amount or percentage of transportation
motor fuels, as measured by volume, to be sold in the state to be advanced biofuels. 4 The goals
for the amounts or percentages to be sold should gradually increase over time, as in-state and
out-of-state supply and production capacities increase. The state should also help facilitate the
transition to advanced biofuels by regulating quality standards for fuel blends.
According to H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, the term "advanced
biofuel" means renewable fuel, other than ethanol derived from corn starch, which has life-cycle
GHG emissions that are at least 50% less than baseline life-cycle GHG emissions. “Baseline lifecycle GHG emissions” means the average life-cycle GHG emissions for gasoline or diesel.
The types of fuels eligible for consideration as "advanced biofuels" may include any of the
following: ethanol derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignicellulose; ethanol derived from
sugar or starch (other than corn starch); ethanol derived from waste material, including crop
residue, other vegetative waste material, animal waste, and food and yard waste; biomass-based
diesel; biogas (including landfill gas and sewage waste treatment gas) produced through the
conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass; butanol or other alcohols produced
through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass; and other fuel derived from
cellulosic biomass. Advanced biofuels also include fuels derived from biomass, such as algae.
Biomass-based diesel fuel also includes bio-based lipids harvested from feedstocks, such as
algae and biogass.
Policy Design
Arkansas should encourage state and national fuel industries to reach for specific goals, as
measured by specific volume amounts or percentages of advanced biofuels, which would
produce fewer GHG emissions when considered on a per-volume and/or per-energy-unit basis.
The state should encourage industry and research universities to work together to create an
Arkansas Alternative Energy Institute.
The state does not wish to encourage the conversion of any human food sources, such as corn, to
alternative fuels, because this is likely to increase the price of food. The Governor's Commission
on Global Warming (GCGW) also does not wish to encourage the production of alternative fuels
that would lead to higher GHG emissions than are produced from petroleum-based fuels. As a
result, the state is supportive of development of advanced biofuels, as listed above under the
Policy Description.

A definition of “advanced biofuels” can be found in Section 201 of the text of federal legislation “H.R.6: Energy
Independence and Security Act of 2007.” The text of the legislation can be found online at: http://thomas.loc.gov/.

Goals:
!

Increase the use of advanced biofuels that emit less GHG emissions in automobiles and other
on-road transportation vehicles to the level of at least 3% of the total consumed by 2015.

Timing:
By 2012, an appropriate state agency will:
!

Develop incentives for industry to produce advanced biofuels that reduce GHG emissions.

!

Develop an industry/research university institute that will continually work toward
commercially available solutions for advanced biofuels.

By 2015, the state or appropriate agency will:
!

Reduce GHG vehicle emissions by converting to fuels that burn much more efficiently, with
the goal of advanced biofuels comprising 3% of the statewide use of fuels by 2015.

!

Work with the Arkansas Alternative Energy Institute to promote biofuel production to aid in
control of GHG emissions and to promote state industries that will provide “green” jobs for
Arkansas workers.

!

Establish legislation to set standards for biofuel production that meets federal and state
regulations for GHG emission levels.

Parties Involved: Arkansas Departments of Natural Resources, Highway and Transportation,
Agriculture, Economic Development, Labor, Forestry, and Energy.

Implementation Mechanisms
To aid in biofuel development, state money could be used to establish partnerships with state and
national laboratories that have already worked on some of the issues of biofuel conversion. This
would bring knowledge of established production/conversion protocols into the state and develop
processing parameters for Arkansas-specific feedstocks.

I-10

The state could incentivize the development of in-state industries and businesses that produce
and distribute alternative fuels:
!

Arkansas should provide incentives to private industries to establish alternative-fuel
infrastructure that could aid in the promotion of alternative-fuel use.

!

The expense of equipment and installation may be offset by the increasing use of these
alternative fuels.

!

The biofuel production plants should optimally be situated within a radius of their feedstocks
as feasible, with use of both rail and truck as appropriate, and with a focus on minimizing the
energy used to distribute the fuel.

!

The distributors of alternative fuels should be in convenient locations to be able to offer fuels
at competitive prices.

This analysis assumes a “fuel-neutral,” low-carbon fuels policy requiring increased use of
biofuels that could be met by a variety of scenarios. A sample scenario is assessed that would
achieve the stated goal for overall increase in advanced biofuels use to 3% of total transportation
fuel consumed in Arkansas.

Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. Clean Cities Alternative Fuel Price Report,
January 2008. Available at: http://www.eere.energy.gov/afdc/price_report.html.

Quantification Methods:
The estimate of GHG emission reductions from this policy is based upon an increase of
alternative-fuel use to 14% of all on-road fuels in the state by 2015 and 25% by 2025. A ramp-up
period is estimated so that alternative-fuel use would increase steadily on a yearly basis between
2010 and 2025.
To estimate the likely ramp-up in alternative-fuel use needed to meet the policy, a potential
scenario was developed for analysis. This scenario is intended to reflect requirements under
current federal law (per the Renewable Fuel Standard), with additional emphasis on advanced
biofuels (represented in this scenario by cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel). In the scenario, by
2025, ethanol sales in Arkansas would represent 23% of gasoline sales, with 18% of the ethanol
used in flex-fuel vehicles (E85) and the remainder used in conventional vehicles operating on
E10. For analysis purposes, ethanol was assumed to be used in the form of either E10 or E85. In
reality, flex-fuel vehicles will be able to operate on any blend of ethanol up to 85%. The analysis
assumptions are intended to reflect that range of blends. In addition, 100% of ethanol is assumed
to come from corn feedstocks in 2010. Starting in 2012, it is assumed that cellulosic ethanol
would begin to make up a significant portion of the ethanol market, ramping up to 50% of
ethanol by 2025. Biodiesel (from soy) is assumed to make up 8% of total Arkansas diesel sales
by 2025. The cumulative effect of this increase in biofuels would be that alternative fuels would
make up 14%, and advanced biofuels would make up 3% of on-road fuels used in Arkansas by
2015, while alternative fuels would make up 25% and advanced biofuels would make up 10% by
2025. Table I-3 shows the assumptions used for this scenario.

Year

Cost is calculated as the incremental cost of biofuels per gallon of gasoline equivalent (for
ethanol) or diesel equivalent (for biodiesel), multiplied by total consumption of each fuel.
Ethanol and gasoline prices in future years are drawn from the Energy Information
Administration’s (EIA's) Annual Energy Outlook 2008 (AEO2008). Based on January 2008
information from the U.S. Department Energy’s (DOE's) Clean Cities Alternative Fuels Price
Report, the difference in the average price of biodiesel compared to conventional diesel in the
Gulf Coast region is approximately $0.11/gallon (less for biodiesel). Note that the cost
calculation does not include federal subsidies in the form of tax credits for ethanol or biodiesel.
In addition, costs related to any vehicle upgrades (e.g., flex-fuel vehicles that can operate on
ethanol blends up to E85) are not included.

I-13

Key Assumptions:
!

Program starts in 2010, the first year of emission reduction.

!

Program reaches the goal of advanced biofuels as at least 3% of total fuels consumed in
Arkansas by 2015.

!

Program applies to all on-road vehicles, “replacing” or (displacing) current gasoline and
diesel fuel.

!

Baseline scenario accounts for:
!

0% ethanol existing market share and

!

0% existing biodiesel market share.

Key Uncertainties
Cellulosic ethanol is assumed to be a significant component of this policy. The timeline for
availability of cellulosic ethanol on a large scale is unknown, although production facilities are
beginning to come on line as of the date of this analysis. Another unknown is the price difference
between cellulosic and corn-based ethanol.
The price differential between biodiesel and diesel is extremely dynamic. The results of the cost
component of this analysis could vary, depending on future changes in that price differential.
Also, to achieve the goals, transportation fuel providers would need to undertake changes in their
production and distribution methods. Because the policy does not prescribe particular technology
pathways, there is uncertainty surrounding which fuels and technologies fuel providers will use
to meet the standard. The program assumes that providers will use the most cost-effective
options to meet the standard, but compliance costs are unknown at this time.
Additional Benefits and Costs
It is generally agreed that increased domestic production of advanced transportation biofuels will
reduce the need to import petroleum-based motor fuels and crude oil from other countries.

TLU-4. Smart Growth, Pedestrian and Bicycle Infrastructure

Policy Description
This policy recommendation calls for incentives and programs to encourage smart growth,
including enhancing the pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. Current land-use development
practices increase vehicle travel by dispersing destinations, which separates activities and favors
automobile travel over alternative modes. "Smart growth" planning by local, regional, and state
governments refers to development that reduces sprawl and maximizes environmental, fiscal,
and economic resources. It incorporates such planning tools as mixed use, open-space
protections, downtown revitalization, “greyfield” redevelopment, 5 infill development, transitoriented development, and pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure. It seeks to preserve open,
recreational, and agricultural spaces and to prevent sprawl, especially on the periphery of urban
areas where sprawling development may otherwise occur.
It is difficult to envision a solution to either global warming or energy security issues that does
not involve slowing the growth of transportation emissions. To date, the national discussion of
climate and energy initiatives has focused on technological solutions—namely, developing more
fuel-efficient vehicles or lower-carbon fuels. Experts recognize, however, that all such
technological solutions will be overwhelmed by the continued growth in automobile travel,
thanks to our increasingly spread-out, car-dependent development patterns. During 1982–2002,
these land-intensive development patterns caused development acreage to increase at twice the
rate of population growth. This in turn caused per-capita vehicle miles traveled (VMT) to
increase three times faster than America's population growth over that same period. It's no
accident that VMT is increasing as the country continues to build and develop more areas where
residents have no realistic choice but to drive long distances each day to meet their daily needs.
A 2002 study by Smart Growth America found that the degree of sprawl was the most significant
cause of a high VMT rate. 6
The good news is that we can make enormous progress simply by shaping future building to
create communities where people can accomplish more by driving less. Numerous studies
demonstrate that when people are given the option to live in a less automobile-dependent place,
they drive less. According to the report Growing Cooler: The Evidence on Urban Development
and Climate Change, residents of more compact neighborhoods drive 20%-40% less on average,
saving oil and reducing GHG emissions. 7 If we combine compact neighborhoods with increased
investment in public transit of all shapes and sizes (TLU-6, School and University Transportation
Bundle), the resulting synergies can reduce dangerous emissions enormously.

Greyfields are underutilized land in the form of parking lots, declining strip malls, and vacant parcels.

Policy Design
Arkansas should allow, encourage, facilitate, and undertake a set of smart growth activities
related to the following initiatives:
!

Downtown and neighborhood revitalization,

!

Greyfield redevelopment,

!

Infill development,

!

Transit-oriented development (TOD),

!

Sprawl reduction,

!

Bike and pedestrian infrastructure,

!

Incentives for urban school districts,

!

Highway access management and corridor maintenance, and

!

Smart growth planning, modeling, and tools.

Goals: Overall goals for the set of activities would be the following:
!

By 2010, 35% of new development and redevelopment will occur in higher-density tracts
(> 2,000 people per square mile), compared to only 10% under the business as usual (BAU)
scenario.

!

By 2010, begin providing economic development incentives and liberalized zoning and
permitting processes (parking requirements, density restrictions, mixed-use restrictions, etc.)
to encourage investment in central business districts.

!

By 2010, begin providing economic incentives, liberalized zoning and land-use restrictions,
and streamlined permitting processes to encourage brownfield redevelopment, infill
development, and TOD.

!

By 2010, develop and adopt a comprehensive plan to preserve open space on the edges of
urban areas where sprawling development may otherwise occur, and to encourage regional
cooperation in reducing sprawl.

!

By 2010, develop a program for information dissemination and technical assistance to
facilitate the adoption of smart growth planning processes, models, and tools by local and
regional jurisdictions.

!

By 2015, require "complete streets" policies, providing for systematic adoption of sidewalks
and bikeways.

Timing: See above, with most strategies to be implemented by 2010.

I-16

Parties Involved: State government, local government, city planners from around the state
(including, specifically, the city planners in Fayetteville), individual property owners, and
investors.
Implementation Mechanisms
Downtown and Neighborhood Revitalization
Many U.S. towns and cities are crowded during business days, but are deserted by night and on
weekends because few people live there. Some cities have begun turning this problem around by
revitalizing their downtowns and centrally located neighborhoods. Downtown revitalization can
be profitable (by reusing existing infrastructure), can provide a better quality of life (by
centralizing entertainment and retail, providing a critical mass for success), and can improve the
environment (by reducing VMT, providing sufficient density for walking, bicycling, and transit,
reducing sprawling-edge development, and preserving greenfields).
Arkansas should provide economic development incentives and liberalized zoning and
permitting processes (parking requirements, density restrictions, mixed-use restrictions, etc.) to
encourage investment in central business districts and neighborhoods. The state could provide
tax incentives for property owners to do historic preservation and restoration on buildings
located in historic downtowns. (Arkansas is one of the few states lacking a personal income tax
incentive for historic preservation.) State agencies should lead by example and locate offices and
services in downtowns and centrally located neighborhoods. Main Street Arkansas is a state
program that assists downtowns in their revitalization efforts and provides training and support
to 30 participating communities. A major principle of sustainable building practices is to
rehabilitate, refurbish, remodel, or convert existing structures.
Greyfield Redevelopment
"Infill" development of all sorts reduces sprawl and VMT. Many of Arkansas’ urban areas have a
large percentage of greyfields. Redeveloping greyfields has the additional advantage of
improving the quality of life in city centers, which increases the number of downtown residents,
workers, and visitors. Arkansas should provide economic incentives, liberalized zoning and landuse restrictions, and streamlined permitting processes to encourage greyfield redevelopment.
This can be a key factor in urban revitalization by providing new centrally located areas for
residential, commercial, or mixed-use development. It also reduces average trip distances, and
encourages walking, bicycling, and public transit.
Infill Development
Development of vacant or underused parcels of land within existing developed areas reduces
average trip distances and saves public funds by taking advantage of existing infrastructure and
public utilities. By increasing the local population density, it also encourages walking, bicycling,
and public transit. Arkansas should provide economic incentives, liberalized zoning and land-use
restrictions, and streamlined permitting processes to encourage infill development. Toward this
end, Arkansas should pass Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) enabling legislation, so that
cities can preserve high-value agricultural land and natural resources by transferring

I-17

development rights to designated infill areas and allow market forces to determine the price of
development credits (additional units per acre). 8
Additionally, enabling cities to adopt tiered impact fees, especially with regard to roads, would
help guide development to appropriate infill locations. Tiered impact fees charge less for
developments located near the core of the city and more for developments located on the urban
fringe. The lack of county zoning in most of Arkansas severely limits the ability for cities to
discourage sprawl. Development often happens just over the line, resulting in leap-frog
development patterns and an increased tax burden for providing urban services, such as fire and
police protection. A major initiative should be made to bring planning and zoning to all counties
having significant urban centers.
Transit-Oriented Development
Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) is the creation of compact, mixed-use commercial or
residential communities designed to maximize access to public transit (see TLU-6), while also
creating a community attractive to pedestrians and bicyclists. TOD thus reduces VMT and the
associated GHG emissions. Arkansas should provide economic incentives, liberalized zoning and
land-use restrictions, and streamlined permitting processes to encourage TOD. Regional Mobility
Authorities throughout Arkansas should devote at least 20% of their funds to mass transit options
to facilitate this mechanism.
Reducing Sprawl
For smart growth policies to be truly effective, the efforts must be regional or, better yet,
statewide. If all municipalities in an area are not practicing smart growth, development may
gravitate to greenfields at the edges of cities or between cities, resulting in sprawl. Arkansas
should adopt a comprehensive plan to preserve open space on the edges of urban areas where
sprawling development may otherwise occur, and to encourage regional cooperation in reducing
sprawl. One approach would be to encourage "green zones" at the edges of cities that would be
permanently zoned for agricultural use only, and off limits to developers. 9 Also, the state should
provide for TDR programs, discussed above.
Bike and Pedestrian Infrastructure
Smart growth aims to encourage alternative (non-automobile) transportation modes, especially
walking and bicycling. Arkansas towns, cities, and counties should improve and construct
sidewalks and bikeways, and the state should provide economic incentives to encourage such
infrastructure development. This is particularly true in commercial areas without adequate
8

TDR is a voluntary, market-based implementation process by which the development rights of a landowner in the
area to be protected (the “sending” zone) are transferred to an appropriate, community-designated area (the
“receiving” zone). The sending zone is placed in a permanent conservation easement, such as a land bank, and the
receiving zone is granted an increase in land-use intensity, such as density bonuses or increases in building height.
Since this process does not require local governments to purchase any lands, and since concentrated development in
the receiving zone saves money on municipal services, very little public funding is required. At least 23 states have
adopted TDR enabling legislation.

I-18

sidewalks and in residential and other areas where pedestrian and bicycle safety is a concern. The
attraction of bicycling and walking is greatly enhanced by facilities that are safe and that also
"feel" safe to bicyclers and walkers.
Bikeways can take the form of designated bike lanes on shared streets, or of trails that are
separated from roadways, except at crossings. The former are typically four or more feet wide.
Separate bike trails are usually designed as multi-use trails that also serve joggers, strollers,
skaters, etc. Bikeways are not just for recreational use; they also serve commuters, shoppers,
school children, and others. Indeed, real reductions in automobile VMT can occur by using
bikeways for transportation. For example, in Scandinavian countries, despite the cold weather,
30% of all commuters commute by bicycle. Other infrastructure improvements could include
bicycle parking and shower or locker amenities at places of employment. Cities, regional
jurisdictions, and universities can institute "free bicycles" programs, as is done in many U.S. and
European cities.
Arkansas should require "complete streets" policies, providing for systematic adoption of
sidewalks and bikeways to help achieve these goals. All state road projects should include
infrastructure to accommodate bikes and pedestrians as a complete street model. At the local
level, cities should also be encouraged to create complete streets and adopt trail and on-street
bikeway master plans. These master plans should be recognized and included in the planning of
all state and city improvement projects. Grant funding should be increased and made available to
communities for the construction of multi-use trails and on-street bike facilities. Legislation
should be created to allow road turn-back funds to be used for alternative transportation projects.
Arkansas should also encourage property owners to donate necessary portions of property for
multi-use trails through tax incentives or other benefits. New residential and commercial
developments should be required to dedicate rights of way for multi-use trails when identified on
the trail master plans. Riparian corridors should be identified for multi-use trails and protected as
an enduring green network through their communities.
Incentives for Urban School Districts
Arkansas should provide incentives for school districts to develop new facilities within existing
urban cores. Locating new school facilities on the urban fringe encourages sprawl and VMT. A
first step would be to remove the excessive acreage requirement that the state mandates for
locating new schools (80–100 acres). Rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of existing facilities
should be the first option when school expansion is necessary. The Arkansas Department of
Education needs to revisit its long-range planning and goals in order to place higher priorities on
issues related to sustainability and reasonable location requirements. The placement of school
facilities has broad and often drastic effects on how communities grow and evolve. Autodependent models of developing schools will quickly fade as the era of cheap energy comes to a
close. An emphasis on central location and the ability for alternative transportation options
should have significant weight when making policy decisions regarding school locations.
Forward-thinking, yet common-sense, approaches are necessary to implement this policy.
Highway Access Management and Corridor Maintenance
The Arkansas State Highway and Transportation Department should adopt access management
standards to apply to all Arkansas road projects. Adequate prior transportation planning reduces
I-19

the number of access/conflict points along state highways and municipal arterial roads and
ensures that future roadway capacity is not significantly diminished over time. Arkansas should
promote the development of “complete, compact, and connected” neighborhoods through the
adoption of smart growth policies. Cul-de-sac subdivisions should be discouraged because of the
increased VMT associated with them. Arkansas could significantly reduce GHGs and the
maintenance cost of mowing highways by funding a wildflower and native plant corridor
program modeled after the program that exists in Texas.
Smart Growth Planning, Modeling, and Tools
Arkansas should provide state funding, information dissemination, and technical assistance to
facilitate the adoption of smart growth planning processes, models, and tools by local and
regional jurisdictions. A smart growth toolkit should be developed and distributed to all cities
and counties.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
As described above.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Transportation sector surface transportation fuels produce CO2 (which accounts for
approximately 96% of transportation GHG emissions) and other GHG emissions (methane
[CH4], nitrous oxide [N2O], and hydrofluorocarbons).
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
This analysis considers potential GHG reductions from reductions in VMT for personal (nontruck) travel, as a result of a shift toward more compact development patterns following smart
growth principles. The analysis relies on estimates of per-capita VMT by census tract population
density range, as developed by Steve Polzin, Director of the Center for Urban Transportation
Research (CUTR) Mobility Program for the CUTR VMT forecasting model. The CUTR model
is based on analysis of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 2001 National Household Travel
Survey data. 10 The model provides estimates of per-capita VMT by state for five density ranges.
It is currently set up for years 2005, 2035, and 2055; for this analysis, results were interpolated
for Center for Climate Studies (CCS) analysis years.
The observed relationship between per-capita VMT and population density serves as a proxy for
the effects of smart growth development, as described above. Higher levels of population density
are associated with overall shorter trips, because destinations are closer together. In addition,
areas with higher population densities are more likely to have pedestrian-friendly design
(walkability, mixed use, etc.) and to support transit service. It is difficult to separate out the
individual effects of the various smart growth strategies at this aggregate level of analysis, but
the analysis provides an indicator of what can be achieved through a combined set of smart
growth policies.

Quantification Methods:
The specific method used to estimate GHG benefits of smart growth strategies is as follows:
!

Total population in 2000 was identified by five census tract density ranges, as identified in
the CUTR model (< 500, 500–1,999, 2000–3,999, 4,000–9,999, and 10,000 or more people
per square mile) for metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan areas.

!

The change in population from 1990 to 2000, and associated share of change by density
range, was identified from census data.

!

Statewide population by tract density range for 2010 (to use as the base year when policy
changes are proposed to begin) was estimated by taking state population forecasts for 2010,
and allocating 2000–2010 growth to tract density range in the same proportion as 1990–2000
growth.

!

For the baseline (BAU) scenario, new population growth between 2010 and 2025 (as
determined from state forecasts developed for the CCS baseline) was allocated to tract
density ranges based on the share of growth in the 1990–2000 time frame. Total statewide
growth is forecast at 363,000 people, or 13%. The proportion of existing housing stock
(population) that would be redeveloped over this time frame was estimated at 9%,
representing a rate of 6% per decade between 2010 and 2025. Two-thirds of this
I-21

redevelopment is assumed to occur in place, and one-third is redeveloped elsewhere, with
this redevelopment allocated to tract density ranges based on the 1990–2000 share of
population growth. (The 6% and two-thirds figures come from the 2007 Growing Cooler
report's Section 1.7.3, citing analysis of census data by Nelson [2006].)
!

For the Climate Action scenario, a significant shift in the proportion of new development and
relocated redevelopment was assumed to take place, with higher-density tracts (> 2,000
people per square mile) receiving 35% of new development under this scenario, compared to
only 10% under the BAU scenario. Total population by tract density under this scenario was
then calculated. This relatively conservative reallocation scenario reflects the largely rural
and small-city nature of population growth in Arkansas, based on analysis of census data
from 1990 and 2000 showing that most (two-thirds) of the growth occurred in nonmetropolitan areas, while most of the remainder occurred in smaller metropolitan areas. The
analysis assumes that rural growth would occur in a more clustered pattern, with shifts in
population from the lowest density range (fewer than 500 people per square mile, typical of
rural tracts) to the second lowest density range (500–1,999 people per square mile, typical of
smaller cities/towns), and that metropolitan growth would shift more toward the third and
fourth density ranges (2,000–9,999 people per square mile), representing an increase in
higher-density infill and redevelopment.

!

Total personal-travel VMT was calculated under the BAU and Climate Action scenarios,
based on VMT per capita (from the CUTR model) and total 2025 population by tract density
range, and the percentage reduction in personal-travel VMT was calculated.

!

The percentage reduction in VMT was adjusted by 90%, to estimate the percentage reduction
in GHG emissions. This factor is the same as used in the Growing Cooler report, to account
for the fact that higher-density areas may experience somewhat lower travel speeds and,
therefore, slightly reduced fuel economy. 11

!

BAU GHG emissions in 2025 for passenger travel were estimated as those from all light-duty
VMT. To estimate cumulative emission reductions over the 2010–2025 period, a linear rampup of benefits was assumed over this time frame.

Key Assumptions:
!

The fraction of new population growth and redevelopment by census tract density, under the
BAU scenario.

!

The assumed shift in the fraction of new population growth and redevelopment from lowerdensity to higher-density census tracts, under the Climate Action versus the BAU scenario.

!

The percentage of residential building stock redeveloped (off site) over the analysis time
frame.

Corroborating Methodologies:
This methodology is consistent with another methodology that was tested, based on the
parameters assumed in the Growing Cooler report estimate of CO2 reductions in 2050. The
methodology was adapted to 2025 conditions, and some adjustments were made for Arkansasspecific data where available, including population growth and proportion of VMT in urban
areas. The previous methodology used a number of factors from the Growing Cooler report. The
primary differences are that Growing Cooler assumes a 30% reduction in VMT for “compact
development” (rather than the VMT levels by census tract density range); includes a blanket
assumption of 60% of new (urban) growth reallocated to “compact development”; and does not
assign any VMT reduction to growth in rural areas. The methodology produces a result similar to
that of the original analysis, projecting a GHG reduction of 1% for passenger travel, compared to
the 2025 BAU scenario, or a savings of 0.15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MMtCO2e) in 2025, compared to 0.17 in the methodology above that was utilized.
Key Uncertainties
Smart growth depends upon the decisions of many individual property and business owners, as
well as the efficacy of incentives and other programs.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Smart growth generally has very low direct costs to implement, comprised of the governmental
costs of altering regulations and zoning and providing education and technical assistance. Tax
incentives are an income transfer that results in a public-sector cost but offsetting developer
revenue. As most smart growth policies (e.g., allowing higher density and mixed use, reducing
parking requirements) are deregulatory in nature, they are opening the development market and
have significant indirect as well as direct benefits. An exception is growth boundaries, which
restrict the land-use market and have an indirect cost.
Alternative patterns of development have a large number of additional impacts that may provide
both benefits and costs. Smart growth provides a range of co-benefits that are well documented
in other places. Prominent among these is the reduced cost of providing utilities and
infrastructure, as smart growth makes better use of existing facilities and infrastructure and, on
average, has lower demand. Improved air quality, public health (e.g., due to walking), and
quality of life are also notable co-benefits.
Feasibility Issues
Smart growth policies are being considered and implemented around the country in a wide range
of communities. Because most policies are deregulatory in nature, this significantly lowers
political barriers. Much of the timing, feasibility, effectiveness and impacts of smart growth
measures involve building development and population growth depending upon business and
economic cycles.

TLU-5. Improve and Expand Transit Service and Infrastructure

Policy Description
Improvements to existing transit service and expansion of transit routes can shift passenger
transportation from single-occupant vehicles to public transit, thereby reducing GHG emissions.
This mitigation recommendation involves a number of actions to be undertaken by state and
local governments and transit agencies.
Policy Design
Goals:
!

Reduce light-duty vehicle (LDV) total VMT in urban areas from 2008 baseline growth by
1% per year starting in 2010 until 2025.

!

Increase investment in transit service and infrastructure by 2015.

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: State and local governments and transit agencies.
Implementation Mechanisms
The state should implement transit investments that encourage greater use of public
transportation, such as the following:
!

Improve service frequency on selected existing intra- and intercity transit routes (selected
routes would emphasize those for which the measure would generate the greatest additional
ridership or cost-effectiveness).

!

Support and encourage improvements in intra- and intercity bus service.

!

Reduce travel times on selected existing transit routes (signal prioritization, exclusive lanes,
etc.).

!

Improve the quality of service on selected existing transit routes (safety, cleanliness,
improvements to shelters/stations).

!

Provide financing, regulatory relief, and the use of eminent domain to develop and expand
transit service and infrastructure (commuter rail, light rail, bus). In particular, the state should
dedicate funding for the planning and development of commuter/light rail systems, especially
in locations having higher population densities and other characteristics conducive to
successful systems. The first project of this nature could be a case study for the rest of the
state. Where such rail corridors are studied, municipalities in the affected corridor should
begin to address zoning issues around likely future transit stops in order to promote increased
residential and commercial densities. In addition, Regional Mobility Authorities throughout

I-24

Arkansas should always include mass transit options in their considerations and should
devote 5%–50% of their funding to mass transit options.
!

Offer incentives to potential passengers, and provide loans and/or subsidies to operators
(public or private) to offer improved and less expensive intercity bus service.

!

Provide financing, regulatory relief, and the use of eminent domain to develop, publicly or
privately, a high-speed intercity passenger rail system serving major urban areas. Provide
additional financial assistance to improve services already provided by Amtrak on other
routes.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Transportation sector surface transportation fuels produce CO2 (which accounts for
approximately 96% of transportation GHG emissions) and other GHG emissions (CH4, N2O, and
hydrofluorocarbons).
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
This analysis examines the reductions in GHGs possible from a shift from personal motor
vehicles to transit, which typically emit fewer GHGs per passenger mile. The calculation of
GHG reductions must account both for the reduction in the number of private vehicle miles, but
also for the partly offsetting increase in transit VMT. In addition to these direct reductions from
individuals’ shift of modes, two more long-term, indirect effects will be estimated. The shifting
of trips from personal vehicles to transit can reduce the number of vehicles on the road, and thus
the amount of congestion in urban areas. Reducing congestion improves traffic flow and
improves actual average vehicle fuel economy. Studies have also demonstrated that increased
transit service can help shape land-use patterns, enabling densities and proximity to the center of
urban areas, and resulting in reduced VMT by those living in transit corridors, even if they never
use public transit.

Direct quantification was undertaken for improvements in service frequency, travel time
reductions, and the introduction of new and expansion of existing routes and services. These
were applied to intra- and inter-city bus, vanpools, and rail services. Selected routes were
assumed to emphasize those for which the measure would generate the greatest additional
ridership or cost-effectiveness.
Travel time improvements provide a well-documented means of improving transit service and
ridership. There is a direct benefit to riders as the improved service reduces the “generalized
cost” (time cost plus financial cost) of their trip. In addition to co-benefits in improving service
frequency, there is about a –0.4 elasticity for transit travel time.
Service frequency increases ridership from existing riders and attracts new riders. As waiting
time between vehicles has been shown to be valued about two times more on average than actual
travel time, this mechanism can prove very effective. There is a reported –0.5 elasticity for
service frequency alone (time between buses), while the aggregate impacts for service
improvements in time between vehicles and travel time have shown an elasticity of between –0.6
and –1.0, incorporating the time and frequency impacts of aggregate increases in service miles
provided. An aggregate elasticity of -0.9 was applied to the total increase in vehicle revenue
service miles to capture both factors together and reflect that the focus would be on the most
effective implementation locations.
For service expansions and introduction, both the literature and a first-order statistical analysis
show a long-run elasticity for service expansion of between –0.6 and –1.0. As above, an
aggregate elasticity of -0.9 was applied to the total increase in vehicle revenue service miles to
capture both factors together and reflect that the focus would be on the most effective
implementation locations.
Estimates for the effects of new light rail and commuter rail services were based upon aggregate
information from projects in similar urban areas in other states due to the lack of historical data
in Arkansas.

Congestion reduction benefits from transit were represented by using a factor of 0.00822 private
vehicle gallons saved per passenger-mile of transit ridership based on the Texas Transportation
Institute’s 2007 Annual Urban Mobility Report. 13
Synergies with land-use development were represented as equaling a reduction in VMT equal to
one-quarter of the direct reduction from transit ridership 10 years prior, based on an adjustment
of ICF’s The Broader Connection Between Public Transportation, Energy Conservation and
Greenhouse Gas Reduction very long-term factor, reduced to represent the actual pace of
development. 14
Key Assumptions:
!

Transit services can be expanded and introduced at the same average operating cost as
current services.

!

New or improved services will attract ridership in a manner consistent with service
improvements in other similar areas of the country (i.e., the Arkansas transit market is not at
saturation). Current fuel price increases provide a strong argument for this assumption.

Key Uncertainties
As described above. The timing for availability of additional transit service depends upon the
availability of funding and program implementation.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Transit services have a large number of additional impacts, which provide additional benefits.
Transit service provides mobility, accessibility, and safety benefits that are not included in the
analysis above. Important other co-benefits include improved air quality, public health (e.g., due
to walking), and quality of life. Transit benefits in reducing congestion and facilitating land-use
patterns, such as transit-oriented development and smart growth, are very significant and, as
noted, are partly reflected in the analysis above.
Feasibility Issues
Implementation of additional transit service depends upon availability of funding. The use of
eminent domain for the use of new rail right of ways may also impact feasibility.

TLU-6. School and University Transportation Bundle

Policy Description
In 1969, approximately 50% of students walked or biked to school; by 2001 this number was less
than 16%. These numbers indicate our growing dependence on the combustion engine and
specifically on automotive travel. The reasons behind this drastic decrease in the number of
students walking or riding their bikes to school are many, but include the growing distance of
students’ homes from their schools and an unsafe travel environment, including major road
crossings and the lack of access to sidewalks or multi-use paths. The use of passenger vehicles to
transport students to and from schools, colleges, and universities burns a significant amount of
fossil fuel, which not only releases GHGs into the atmosphere, but also teaches students to travel
by car, instead of utilizing healthier alternatives, such as walking, bicycling, riding the bus, or
carpooling. Schools, colleges, and universities are well positioned to effect the changes in
transportation habits that Arkansas needs if it is to reduce automobile use.
An October 2003 study by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) examined the
relationship between school location, the built environment around schools, mode choices for
trips to school, and the impacts these choices had an air emissions. The study found that school
proximity matters to students, as students with shorter walk and bike times to and from school
were more likely to walk and bike. Additionally, students traveling through higher-quality built
environments were also more likely to bicycle and walk. And finally, because of these travel
behavior choices, centrally located schools that can be reached by walking and bicycling served
to reduce air emissions and demonstrated better air quality within the immediate vicinity
surrounding the school.15
Policy Design
This policy focuses on encouraging the reduction of transportation sector GHG emissions when
transporting students to schools, colleges, and universities.
Goals:
!

By 2010, colleges and universities will study and report on the environmental impacts, the
health and financial costs, and other costs and benefits associated with reduction of student
VMT.

!

By 2012, K-12 schools should consider establishing programs, such as ride sharing and ridesharing clearinghouses; supervised walking to school, including "walking school buses" and
safe routes to schools; and bicycling and mobility education programs that teach students
about the health and environmental benefits of using alternative transportation. Additionally,
these programs should present these alternatives in a manner that students should relate to in
an effort to make it "cool" to walk, bicycle, carpool, or ride the bus.

!

By 2012, K-12 schools should consider developing a program to teach students about the
consequences automobile overuse has on both the environment and on their own personal
health as well as other potential consequences of automobile overuse.

!

By 2012, high schools should consider establishing programs to reduce or abolish student
parking.

!

By 2012, colleges and universities should consider establishing more comprehensive
commuting programs that may include options, such as free bus programs, expanded bicycle
storage, free student bicycles, carpooling programs, and abundant multifamily housing on or
near campus, that also provide nearby access to such services as food, drugstore, etc.

!

By 2012, through a combination of all of these programs, schools, colleges, and universities
should consider reducing the total VMT transporting students by 5%

!

By 2015, through a combination of all of these programs, schools, colleges, and universities
should consider reducing the total VMT transporting students by 10%.

!

By 2025, through a combination of all of these programs, schools, colleges, and universities
should consider reducing the total VMT transporting students by 10%.

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: State of Arkansas, local school districts, parents, students.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

K-12 schools will establish alternative transportation programs by 2012, such as ride sharing
and ride-sharing clearinghouses; supervised walking to school, including "walking school
buses" and safe routes to schools; and bicycling and mobility education programs that teach
students about the health and environmental benefits of using alternative transportation.
Additionally, these programs will present these alternatives in a manner that students will
relate to in an effort to make it “cool” to walk, bicycle, or ride the bus, not only to school, but
also in their daily lives.

!

Arkansas schools will work with the federal "Safe Routes to School" program, which
provides money for local sidewalks and crosswalks to develop safe routes to school. 16

!

Schools will examine their bus routes to determine the most efficient routes to take and will
examine the potential for eliminating stops and having children walk farther to reach the bus.
Having children walk just five to ten more minutes to a bus stop could save each district
substantial sums of money while significantly reducing VMT by district buses.

!

Education programs aimed at addressing the potential risks posed by having students walking
or riding their bikes to school will be implemented for both parents and students. These

16

I-30

programs will identify how the routes to school are designed for safety, provide perspectives
on risk, identify how the routes will be made both visible and accessible, and provide
information and training on the use of safety equipment and how to appropriately dress for
walking and cycling in various weather conditions.
!

K-12 is a critical time to teach children the environmental, health, and other consequences of
automobile overuse. K-12 should make lessons about the environment—why we need it, how
to preserve it, how we affect it, etc.—a routine part of all courses in health, biology, physical
science, and environmental science curricula.

Implementation Mechanisms to Consider:
!

Suggest that all streets near any K-12 school or university have sidewalks for pedestrian use.

!

Suggest that all K-12 schools, colleges, and universities have bicycle access either via multiuse paths or through bike lanes on the surrounding street.

!

Suggest that all K-12 schools, colleges, and universities have bicycle parking conveniently
located near the entrances to buildings and in well-lit areas.

!

Raise the legal age for receiving a driver’s permit to 16, and raise the legal age for receiving
a driver’s license to 17. This would help to increase safety on the roads as well as serve to
reduce GHG emissions by having fewer drivers at the high school level.

!

Suggest that state high schools reduce the size of their parking lots to encourage carpooling
and the use of other alternative transportation, including walking, cycling, and using public
or school-provided transportation. The parking that is available should be neither free nor
subsidized; rather, it should reflect the true cost of the lot and land. Schools can restrict
student parking to seniors or outstanding students.

!

Suggest that Arkansas colleges and universities require first-year, or first- and second-year,
students to live on campus, and to store their cars in distant lots for out-of-town travel.

!

Revise Arkansas’ minimum acreage planning requirements for schools, so that they favor
small, centrally located schools that encourage the use of walking and biking, while
minimizing driving distances.

!

Suggest that the energy required for transporting students to and from a K-12 school, college,
or university is considered as a component when calculating a school building’s energy
ratings.

!

Encourage colleges and universities to establish free bus programs for students, bicycle
storage facilities, free student bicycles, and/or abundant multifamily housing on or near
campus with services (food, drugstore, etc.) nearby.

!

Encourage interviews with state officials or compare with peer states to estimate the number
of students driving to school to develop an estimate of the number of parking spaces that can
be eliminated.

I-31

!

Encourage “ride matching” by examining the U.S. Department of Transportation National
Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data to determine average vehicle occupancy for current
school trips (e.g., siblings, current ride sharing) and estimating what additional penetration
may be available for vehicles not fully occupied.

Arkansas Safe Routes to School Program. Available at:
http://www.arkansashighways.com/planning/safe%20routes/index.htm.
The Active and Safe Routes To School program in Toronto, Ontario, launched a “No Idling” at
schools campaign across Ontario. The program determined that an idling engine uses 3.5 liters of
gasoline per hour, and that 12% of urban smog is attributable to idling vehicles. This program
resulted in an estimated reduction of 247 hours per day of auto idling resulting in an estimated
210.5 few metric tons of CO2 emissions. 17
One year after being implemented at 16 participating schools, Marin Safe Routes To Schools
noted that the schools in Marin County, California, experienced a 57% increase in the number of
children walking and biking, and a 29% decrease in the number of children being driven in a
car. 18
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Reduced GHG emissions from reduction in combustion of transportation fuels, including CO2.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
Emission reductions from these programs were not quantified for Arkansas at this time due to the
lack of available data on travel patterns for students to Arkansas schools and post-secondary
institutions. While some data, such as modal splits for accessing schools, were located, important
elements, such as VMT by personal vehicles and disaggregation by school type and location for
all factors were not. The latter is critical to estimation, due to the predominantly rural and smaller
town and city population of the state. This demographic characteristic also made it impossible to
compare with most existing studies, which include the results from higher-density urban areas.
Qualitatively, emission reductions in the shorter term will come primarily from mode shifting
from passenger vehicle travel to ride sharing, walking, and cycling. The more efficient use of
district busing may also serve to both reduce GHG emissions and provide a significant cost
savings. In the longer term, school siting and sizing will allow greater baseline penetration of
each of these modes, increase the feasibility of bus use, and allow for shorter trip distances for all
transportation modes.

Quantification Methods:
The quantification for this policy recommendation was based upon Arkansas school buses and
VMT reduction goals of 5% by 2015 and 10% by 2025. Emission reductions were quantified by
estimating the reduction in VMT and multiplying that number by the amount of emissions per
mile.
Total Arkansas school bus VMT for 2015 is expected to be 61,707,568 miles. A 5% reduction in
this number would bring the total mileage down to 58,622,190. CO2 emissions would drop from
116,167 tons down to 110,359 tons, for a savings of 5,808 tons of CO2 emissions.
For 2025, total Arkansas school bus VMT is expected to increase to 69,978,688, but reaching the
10% VMT reduction goal would drop this number to 62,980,819. CO2 emissions would fall from
131,737 without VMT reductions to 118,564 upon reaching the goal of a 10% reduction in
school bus VMT.
Other programs that are suggested in this policy if implemented could lead to much more
significant reductions in CO2 emissions. However, many of them would need to be implemented

I-33

on an institution-by-institution basis, and much of the information necessary to accurately
calculate these reductions has not been developed.
Estimating that 200,000 passenger vehicle miles are driven annually to transport students to and
from schools, colleges, and universities, a reduction of 10% through this policy recommendation,
would result in a reduction of 20,000 VMT. If the state average fuel economy at the time this
program is implemented (2012) reaches the 2008 CAFE average of 22.5 miles per gallon (mpg),
that would equal a savings of 889 gallons of gasoline. EPA estimates that each gallon of gasoline
burned results in 19.4 pounds of CO2 emissions. Therefore, a savings of 889 gallons of gasoline
would results in 17,244 pounds of reduced CO2 emissions.
Percentage improvements/increases in the penetration rate for nonmotorized access will be taken
and applied from programs, such as the “walking school bus,” the national pedestrian and bicycle
clearinghouse, Safe Routes to School, and university student commute trip benefit programs.
Key Assumptions:
!

Current mode splits from NHTS will be based on a collection of peer states and assumed to
be similar for Arkansas.

!

TLU-7. Promote and Facilitate Freight Efficiency

Policy Description
Today, nearly 2 million tractor trailers are registered in the United States. Between 1990 and
2006, total U.S. truck tonnage increased by nearly 40%. By 2018, truck tonnage is estimated to
increase by almost 30%, to about 14 billion tons, up from nearly 11 billion tons in 2006. Much of
this traffic routes its way through Arkansas. The state should offer incentives to truck carriers
that invest in low-emission engines.
Typical switch locomotives idle 75% of the time, accounting for 27% of their total fuel use.
Conversion to electrification may be impeded by institutional factors and access—both perceived
and actual—to necessary infrastructure. A check of the DOE truck stop electrification site locator
shows three facilities within a 100-mile radius of Little Rock.
Technologies to reduce heavy-vehicle idling are readily available and cost-effective for longhaul trucking, and include auxiliary power units and truck stop electrification. According to
Argonne National Laboratory, long-haul trucks idle an average of 6 hours per day or 1,830 hours
per year, consuming 20 million barrels of diesel fuel. The use of existing technology can reduce
fuel use by 90%. 19
Improving freight efficiency by expanding the use of short-haul rail over trucking alternatives
will require a fundamental shift in regulatory oversight of the railroads. This will require the
adoption of federal legislation reforming the Surface Transportation Board (STB), reversing
anticompetitive practices, and creating an obligation to serve. The combination of mergers,
bottleneck rules, paper barriers, and antitrust exemption creates an environment that often
eliminates competition and alternatives for small or captive shippers. The state should take an
active role in influencing national rail policies that improve railroad infrastructure, increase rail
capacity, and improve rail yards to expand intermodal options.
Policy Design
This policy focuses on promoting and facilitating freight efficiency by:
!

Improving railroad infrastructure and rail yards;

!

Increasing rail and river shipping capacity, which may allow some freight to shift from trucks
to either rail or ships;

!

Providing economic assistance and regulatory streamlining for the improvement of
intermodal rail yards and the relief of rail freight bottlenecks;

!

Providing electrification at truck stops to reduce idling;

!

Supporting and promoting policies and legislation that improve regulatory oversight of the
railroad industry;

!

Providing plug-in power at port sites to enable vessels to turn off engines and reduce idling;
and

!

Providing incentives for more efficient trucks.

Goals:
!

Reduce diesel truck idling by Class 8 (tractor-trailer) trucks by 80% by 2010 and 100% by
2020.

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: Freight movement operators and other stakeholders.
Implementation Mechanisms
As noted above and as follows:
!

Restore antitrust laws to the railroads.

!

Reform the STB in a manner that reverses anticompetitive rulings, protects the public
interest, creates a proactive STB that will investigate unreasonable rail practices, and creates
and enforces an obligation-to-serve standard.

!

Require timely investments in rail infrastructure, including increased rail capacity and rail
yard enhancements to accelerate intermodal transportation and truck to short-haul rail.

!

Establish standards for truck stop electrification by August 2009, determining the appropriate
technology (such as Idle Aire or Shorepower systems) that will provide an alternative to
idling or auxiliary power units; and establish a reasonable conversion period for transient
vehicles and Arkansas-based organizations to retrofit and adapt their systems before
assessing the need for restrictive ordinances.

!

Complete a similar assessment of port facilities and rail-switching yards to determine the
costs and benefits by mid-2010.

!

Provide incentives to trucking companies that invest in the purchase of low-emission engines
and lightweight tractor/trailer combinations.

Related Policies/Programs in Place

Quantification Methods:
Estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions from reduced idling based on estimating the portion of
emissions and fuel consumption in the Arkansas inventory that is attributable to Class 8 diesel
trucks, estimate the portion of the total fuel consumption that would be consumed during idling,
and apply a targeted reduction of 80% to this amount starting in 2008 and a reduction of 100%
starting in 2015. The assumptions below were used for this estimation.
Key Assumptions:
!

Idle reductions are achieved only by the Class 8 diesel trucks, which idle for an average of 6
hours per day, and consume 0.8–1.2 gallons of diesel per hour during idling.

!

Class 8 diesel trucks will reduce idling by 80% by 2010 or 100% by 2020.

!

The VMT traveled by long-haul combination tractor-trailers (the vehicles that would conduct
the long idling applicable to this analysis) was estimated at 1,841,000 million miles in 2010,
increasing to 3,549,000 million miles by 2025.

!

Idling was assumed to occur for 6 hours every 500 miles (the approximate average distance a
truck would travel between required rest periods).

!

The cost analysis will assume a 5-year lifetime for idling technology equipment, applied to
80% of Class 8 vehicles starting in 2008 and 100% of Class 8 vehicles starting in 2015, at a
cost of $6,000 per vehicle and a $4.80 per gallon of diesel.

!

Program administration costs, enforcement costs, fines, and reduced vehicle maintenance
costs will not be factored into the cost analysis.

!

Rail investment is assumed to occur over a 10-year period and to be sufficient to achieve a
6% shift in modal choice. An estimate of 250 miles of track upgrade at $4.4 million per mile
was used to represent the cost of rail investment (implicitly including rail yard improvements
if needed).

I-37

!

The shift to intermodal rail was assumed to represent a 30% reduction in emissions,
accounting for greater rail circuity, switch-yard locomotives, and the necessary truck haul
to/from rail yard to final destination.

Key Uncertainties
The ability of trucking companies to invest in new equipment depends upon economic
conditions.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Fuel savings are generally recognized as having positive financial impacts upon trucking
companies and truck operators. Some of these positive savings may be passed on to consumers
of the goods that are being transported.
Feasibility Issues
Some technologies are "off the shelf," while others are not yet widely implemented in the
marketplace.

TLU-8. Procurement of Efficient Fleet Vehicles (Passenger and Freight)

Policy Description
Arkansas state and local government agencies should "lead by example" by enacting
procurement policies and or joining the EPA's SmartWay program and utilizing the SmartWay
Upgrade Kits that result in adoption of lower-emitting vehicle fleets. The three primary
components of the SmartWay program are: (1) creating partnerships between shippers, carriers,
and program sponsors; (2) reducing all unnecessary engine idling; and (3) increasing the
efficiency of LDVs, heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), rail, and intermodal operations.
This policy recommendation strengthens Arkansas' commitment to reduce GHG emissions
through fuel efficiency in vehicles owned by the state, while also encouraging private and public
agencies to develop incentive programs that might, for example, help with the initial costs of
purchasing such vehicles.
Policy Design
In leading by example, state government will ensure that its own fleet of vehicles meets or
exceeds the targets set for the state as a whole, while providing available means for all public and
private vehicles to also exceed these standards voluntarily. To the extent possible, the state
should be encouraged to purchase domestically produced vehicles when all other vehicle
characteristics are comparable.
Goals:
!

By 2010, identify barriers to purchasing hybrid vehicles, and research and develop solutions
to procure hybrid or other lower-GHG-emitting vehicles in the state.

!

By 2010, ensure that the overall state of Arkansas fleet considers the EPA fuel efficiency
rating calculated over the life cycle of the vehicles purchased for the fleet.

!

By 2015, ensure that low-carbon fuels are purchased for the state motor pool fleet, wherever
they are available and if applicable for the vehicle type.

!

By 2019, at least 70% of all HDVs and by 2014 at least 90% of all LDVs are "fuel efficient,"
meeting, on average, a higher mpg rate for the state's HDV and LDV fleets.

Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Arkansas state and local government agencies, private industries and fleets,
trucking industry.
Other: None noted.
Implementation Mechanisms
None noted.

I-39

Related Policies/Programs in Place
None noted.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
None noted.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
GHGs and fuel costs will be reduced primarily through the purchase of HDVs that are more fuel
efficient within their vehicle class, and through better “right-sizing” of the state vehicle fleet, so
that vehicles of a heavier class are not purchased and/or utilized when a lighter, more fuelefficient vehicle would suffice. Care must be taken to account for the fact that the state may
dispose of some vehicles before the end of their useful lives. This could imply the pushing of
either less or more fuel-efficient vehicles into the non-state-owned vehicle fleet in Arkansas.
Data Sources:
!

State HDV fleet composition and utilization.

!

Average annual HDV acquisitions.

!

State vehicle fleet diesel and biodiesel use.

Quantification Methods:
!

Based on the 2010 initiation and 2019 70% goal, penetration of more fuel-efficient HDVs
into the state fleet will be calculated, along with the percentage reduction in fuel use.

!

Based on the 2015 low-carbon fuel target, an estimate will be made of the potential
penetration (accounting for national fuel availability) rate and the GHG benefits (using a lifecycle analysis of fuel emissions) of using biodiesel.

Key Assumptions:
!

Fleet turnover and procurement will continue at the same rate as previously. Accelerated
procurement rates would be considered to displace less fuel-efficient vehicles into the nonstate fleet more rapidly, counteracting some benefits.

!

Biodiesel is assumed to be the only low-carbon fuel available by 2015, with the exception of
natural gas, which buses may also run on.

TLU-9. Fuel Efficiency: Clean Car Incentive

Policy Description
To reduce gasoline consumption and GHG emissions, Arkansas should adopt a "clean car
incentive" system. Unlike a tailpipe emissions mandate or mpg mandate, a market-based
incentives program would give rebates to Arkansans who purchase new vehicles that reduce oil
consumption and GHG emissions by being more fuel efficient. The program would be selffinanced by being paid for with disincentives (fees) to those who purchase new vehicles that are
less fuel-efficient. The rebates (or fees) would be subtracted from (or added to) the purchase
price of the vehicle at the point of sale. The "pivot point"—the mileage standard that divides
rebates from fees—would be calculated from recent Arkansas vehicle sales based on the
condition that the program be self-financing. To protect light truck (pickup truck) owners, light
trucks would be treated as a separate class with their own pivot point. The clean car incentive
would apply only once for each vehicle, at the point of sale of new cars, and so would not affect
the price of used cars.
This incentive plan, often called a "feebate," has been adopted in various forms by Canada,
Austria, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and France, and is being seriously considered by
California, Massachusetts, Vermont, and at least five other states. This plan was endorsed by the
U.S. National Research Council in a 2002 study. 20 The Rocky Mountain Institute, a well-known
energy analysis organization, makes this plan the centerpiece of its automobile policy
recommendations. 21
Incentive programs of this sort have two kinds of effects: They encourage consumers to purchase
more efficient vehicles, and they encourage manufacturers to produce more efficient vehicles
that can take advantage of the rebates.
Vehicle incentive programs have the potential to affect consumer behavior in terms of choices of
motor vehicles. The uncertainty of these programs is the degree to which they will result in
measureable changes in consumer choices and behavior. Most studies to date have indicated that
state and local policies in states with small populations of vehicles are likely to have little impact
upon the types of vehicles that are offered in the marketplace. 22 It is possible that state and local
policies can affect some individual choices, but studies to date (including studies by Oak Ridge

National Laboratory) 23,24,25 indicate that the overall effect of these individual choices is small,
unless the program is coordinated with other states and thereby has an effect on the range of
vehicles offered in the marketplace.
To promote energy efficiency and GHG reductions, Arkansas should study the adoption of a
"clean car incentive" system. Unlike a tailpipe emissions mandate or mpg mandate, an incentives
program would encourage Arkansans to purchase new vehicles that save social costs (global
warming costs) by being more fuel efficient.
Policy Design
Goals and Timing: Have the clean car incentive program in place by 2010. As a plausible goal,
increase the percentage of new high-efficiency vehicles (those with gasoline mileages above the
initial pivot point) and decrease the percentage of new low-efficiency vehicles by several
percentage points (perhaps 10%) by 2015. As another kind of plausible goal, might move the
pivot point toward higher gasoline mileage by a few miles per gallon by 2015.
By 2012, the state or appropriate agency will:
!

Develop a program to help reduce GHG vehicle emissions by encouraging greater use of
vehicles that produce less GHGs.

!

Develop incentives and/or disincentives for purchasing new, lower-GHG, more energyefficient vehicles.

By 2020:
!

The majority of vehicles on the road (greater than 50%) will produce less GHG emissions
than the average for the U.S. fleet, and will be in compliance with federal and state GHG
emission levels.

!

The state or appropriate agency will establish legislation to set standards for new vehicles
with mandatory manufacture labeling.

Parties Involved: Arkansas Departments of Motor Vehicles and Transportation, American and
foreign automobile industries, EPA, Arkansas Energy Office.

new vehicles that impose social costs by being less fuel efficient. The incentives (or

disincentives) would be subtracted from (or added to) the purchase price of the vehicle at the
point of sale. The "pivot point"—the mileage standard that divides incentives from
disincentives—would be calculated from recent Arkansas vehicle sales based on the condition
that the program be self-financing. To protect pickup truck owners, light trucks would be treated
as a separate class, with their own pivot point between those vehicles that receive rebates and
those that pay fees.
Incentives and disincentives should be zero at the pivot point and should rise in proportion to
each vehicle's gasoline savings or consumption relative to the pivot point. Studies suggest that
this rise should be around $1,000 per 0.01 gallons per mile (gpm); that is, for each 0.01 gpm that
a particular vehicle type saves (relative to the pivot point), the owner receives a rebate of $1,000,
and similarly for each 0.01 gpm that a particular vehicle consumes (above the pivot point). For
example, if the pivot point for all passenger cars is, say, 23 mpg (or 0.043 gpm), then a car
getting 18 mpg (0.056 gpm) is 0.013 gpm worse than the pivot point, and so incurs a $1,300 fee.
Another car getting 36 mpg (0.028 gpm) is 0.015 gpm better than the pivot point, so it earns a
$1,500 rebate. With a $1,000 per 0.01 gpm rise, the maximum incentives and disincentives
would run around $2,500.
Because vehicles will (it is hoped) become more efficient, the pivot point will need to be readjusted every year to reflect the most recent year's gasoline mileage data. The clean car
incentive would apply only once for each vehicle, at the point of sale of new cars, and so would
not affect the price of used cars.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act requires automakers to increase the average
fuel economy of LDVs offered in the marketplace to an equivalent of 35 mpg by 2020.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
This policy recommendation will assess the potential for GHG reductions from state policies.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
GHG reductions and costs or cost savings are not estimated, as the results of the study will
provide further information about the potential for state action in this area to significantly reduce
GHG emissions.
Key Uncertainties
Consumer response to incentive programs varies from region to region.
Additional Benefits and Costs

TLU-10. Public Education

Policy Description
This policy focuses on better informing the public of the measures individuals can take to reduce
their transportation-related GHG emissions. Drivers will voluntarily reduce fuel use and GHG
emissions from their activities when they have the information necessary to make proper
decisions.
The recommendation would involve development and implementation of a curriculum that
addresses limiting GHGs in transportation through:
!

Education about transportation choices and consequences: low-GHG-emitting vehicles,
carpooling, use of alternative fuels, walking, biking, telecommuting, mass transit, safety
issues, ride sharing in schools, etc.

!

Improved vehicle operation and maintenance: regular vehicle tune-ups, fuel-efficient tires,
coolest temperature fueling, tire pressures, engine lubricants, slower acceleration, shifting at
lower revolutions per minute, cruise control, turning off vehicles when parked, eliminating
"jack-rabbit" starts.

!

Education about city planning choices.

The curriculum would be a requirement for all driver training programs and would be distributed
through other possible venues as deemed appropriate by the agency(ies) developing the program.
This program should include questions pertinent to training included on the written/driving
portion of private and commercial driver licensing tests. (Driver training programs in Utah and
Arizona currently incorporate this type of curriculum in classroom settings.) In addition,
programs that include this curriculum are to be mandated for both state and municipal fleet
operators. All GHG-saving application methods included in the curriculum would be enforced at
state and municipality fleet levels.
In the interest of time and expense, it is recommended that existing curricula from such entities
as DOE or the National Energy Foundation be examined for application and modified as needed.
Policy Design
Goals:
!

Reduce transportation GHG emissions through education to promote intelligent
transportation purchasing choices and vehicle operation. [Unable to quantify effects of
educational programs at this time.]

!

Begin the consumer information program in 2008, and extend it as resources become
available.

I-46

Timing:
!

By 2010, the state or appropriate agency would develop a marketing program for fuelefficient replacement tires and energy-efficient driving practices and devices.

!

By 2010, the state or appropriate agency would ensure that training be delivered for all state
and municipal fleet operators.

!

By 2010, private and commercial driver licensing tests would be modified to incorporate
information about fuel-saving driving practices.

Parties Involved: Driver training programs; Arkansas Department of Motor Vehicles; state,
commercial, and municipal fleets.

Overlap Discussion:
The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced or sequestered and the costs of a policy
recommendation within the Agriculture, Forestry and Waste Management (AFW) sectors
overlap with some of the quantified benefits and costs of policy recommendations within other
sectors. Where this overlap has been determined to exist, the sector totals have been adjusted,
and each instance is outlined below. Overlaps between recommendations within AFW have been
accounted for within the goal-setting process.
AFW-4 outlines how biomass may be utilized for energy production. The Energy Supply (ES)
Technical Working Group (TWG) also quantified the use of biomass for energy production (e.g.,
ES-3 [Renewable Portfolio Standard]). The analysis assumes complete overlap between the ES
and AFW biomass-to-energy recommendations.
AFW-7 (Urban Forestry) addresses planting trees in urban settings. The Residential,
Commercial, and Industrial (RCI) sector TWG does not specifically include tree planting to
reduce energy use in buildings as part of demand-side management and other energy efficiency
programs. As such, no adjustments were made to the sector total.
AFW-5 focuses on biofuels. Similar to biomass utilization for energy production, the utilization
of biomass for the production of cellulosic biofuels was greater under the Transportation and
Land Use (TLU) policies than AFW for all years after 2015, although the AFW policy was
slightly larger from 2010 to 2015. To adjust for the overlap between these two sectors, the AFW
sector total GHG emission reductions and costs were reduced by the proportion determined to be
included under the TLU analysis. Full overlap was assumed for years after 2015, and the GHG
reductions and costs have been removed from the AFW sector totals accordingly.
No reductions from recent actions have been made to the AFW sector totals.

AFW-1. Manure Management

Policy Description
Potential manure management practices that reduce GHG emissions associated with manure
handling and storage include manure composting to reduce methane (CH4) emissions, movement
of manure from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deficient areas, and improved methods for application to
fields (for reduced nitrous oxide [N2O] emissions). Application improvements include
incorporating manure into soil instead of surface spraying or spreading. Also, implementing
digester and energy recovery projects at confined animal operations reduces methane emissions
and uses the energy to displace fossil fuels. To date, most of these projects have been
implemented at dairies and swine operations.
Policy Design
Goals: Reduce CH4 and N2O emissions from dairy, hog, and poultry operations by 40% by 2025,
through improved manure handling and storage practices, compared to business as usual (BAU).
Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of
Agriculture, Arkansas Natural Resources Commission, research institutions, and farmers.
Other: Previous studies have determined that deep stacking litter produces significant N2O
emissions (deep stacking litter is very similar to composting). While composting may lower CH4
emissions, it will probably raise N2O emissions. This process also generates and wastes ammonia
emissions.
Velthof et al. (2003) 2 found that more N2O was emitted when manure was incorporated into soil
compared to when applied to the surface. They looked at applying manure at different depths,
but found surface application was the best. It is suspected that incorporating manure into soil
increases the potential for denitrification. Nevertheless, incorporating manure into soil may still
be considered good practice, as it reduces nutrient runoff and ammonia emissions and improves
nitrogen uptake.
Implementation Mechanisms
A variety of management practices could lead to reductions in GHG emissions, including dry
management systems, wet management systems (e.g., anaerobic lagoons, pit storage, and
liquid/slurry), daily spread, composting, covering, and modifying animal feed. The key
uncertainties section includes a discussion on each of these.

Poultry Litter
Act 1061 (HB 1654)—The act declares various areas of Arkansas to be nutrient surplus areas for
phosphorus and nitrogen, authorizes the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission to make rules
concerning management of nutrients in nutrient surplus areas, and creates penalties for violations
of the act.
Poultry Feeding—Management Plans
Act 2294 (SB 1160)—This act requires that, after January 1, 2007, poultry litter be applied to
soils or associated crops within a nutrient surplus area in accordance with a nutrient management
plan or poultry litter management plan.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CH4: Manure management captures and utilizes or prevents the creation of CH4.
N2O: Reductions occur when nitrogen runoff and leaching are reduced. (Runoff and leaching
lead to the formation and emission of N2O.)

Quantification Methods: Not applicable.
Key Assumptions: Not applicable.
Key Uncertainties
A variety of sources have been considered in attempting to quantify the best manure
management practices to reduce GHG emissions. While it is very likely that manure
management can reduce emissions, the achievable level of emission reductions is uncertain. It is
unclear if the goal of reducing emissions by 40% is overly ambitious.
In general, difficulties in quantifying this level of reductions come from the tradeoff between
N2O emissions and CH4 emissions. Dry management systems typically keep CH4 emissions low,
but can lead to higher N2O emissions. Wet management systems, such as anaerobic lagoons, pit
storage, and liquid/slurry, help reduce N2O emissions, but often increase CH4 emissions. For
areas with temperatures similar to those of Arkansas, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) recommends daily spread as the best practice for reducing CH4 emissions,
although N2O emissions from this approach are not quantified by the IPCC, and instead are
considered as part of soil emissions. 3 Composting manures can suppress CH4 emissions, but can

also increase formation of N2O. 4 Covering manure can reduce N2O emissions, but has an
uncertain impact on CH4 formation. 5 Manure management can be achieved by modifying animal
feed or by composting manure, but further study of the impacts of these practices is necessary to
determine their true efficacy. 6
In addition, the Arkansas Natural Resources Commission recommended that Dr. Philip Moore at
the University of Arkansas could provide assistance in quantifying this recommendation. Dr.
Moore did not have any specific recommendations for how to reduce emissions, but he did
outline several methods that increase N2O emissions, such as deep stacking manure, directly
injecting manure into the soil, and composting poultry litter. 7 Other studies have found that
composting manure increases GHG emissions,8 and N2O emissions increase by applying manure
just below the surface. 9
A recent article pertaining to GHG emissions from swine found that an “on-farm wastewater
treatment system consisting of liquid–solid separation, treatment of the separated liquid using
aerobic biological N [nitrogen] removal, chemical disinfection and soluble P [phosphorus]
removal using lime” could reduce GHG emissions by 97%. 10 Swine emissions in Arkansas are
9% of total manure management emissions. Because this particular practice is not applicable to
poultry litter or cow manure, it most likely would not produce significant benefits for Arkansas.
However, this does show a significant decrease is possible through a new manure management
approach.
Additional research is required on the best management practices for reducing GHG emissions.
Because swine emissions are responsible for the majority of manure emissions in the country, the
majority of research has focused on the best management practices for swine farms. Poultry litter

AFW-2. Promotion of Farming Practices That Achieve GHG Benefits

Policy Description
The state could provide incentives to farmers for using production processes that achieve net
GHG benefits. For example, some organic farming practices could reduce GHG emissions
compared to conventional farming, depending on the specific practices implemented (e.g., use of
no-till cultivation and fewer chemicals).
Policy Design
Goals:
! By 2025, implement cultivation practices to enhance soil carbon levels on 40% of the
acreage that is not already using these practices.
!

By 2025, implement cultivation practices to increase nutrient efficiency by 20%, compared to
BAU.

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of
Agriculture, Arkansas Natural Resources Commission, research institutions, and farmers.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Provide education outreach—information about the most up-to-date research.

!

Document the environmental co-benefits of carbon sequestration practices.

!

Encourage farmers to adopt voluntary best management practices.

!

Encourage research and development of farming practices and cropping systems that increase
carbon input (e.g., reversion to native vegetation, setting aside agricultural land as grassland,
improved crop rotations, yield enhancement measures, organic amendments, cover crops,
improved irrigation practices) or decrease carbon output (e.g., proper tillage methods), while
maintaining crop yield, so that GHG emissions are reduced.

!

Evaluate and implement economical mechanisms that may affect crop choice (e.g., support
payments, crop insurance, disaster relief) and farmland preservation (e.g., conservation
easement, use-value taxation, agricultural zoning) as incentives to increase the carbon stock
of agricultural soil.

!

Continue to research, implement, and evaluate genetically modified (GM) crops for their
significant contributions to reducing GHG emissions through reduced fuel consumption and
additional soil sequestration associated with reduced- or no-tillage cultivation. Further

Co-existence of genetically modified (GM) and non-GM, including organic, crops has been occurring not only in
Arkansas, but in all of North America. While the first generation of GM crops has concentrated mostly on herbicide
tolerance and resistance to insect pests, consideration of climate stresses on crop yields is expected to influence
further consideration of drought- and salt-tolerant crops that require less fertilizer. Biotech crops have been shown to
save farmers 441 million gallons of fuel through reduced fuel operations, which eliminated nearly 10.2 million
pounds of CO2 emissions from 1996 to 2005. See: Graham Brookes and Peter Barfoot. "Global Impact of Biotech

strip-till), and other conservation farming practices that provide enhanced ground cover, or other
crop management practices that achieve similar soil carbon benefits. Conservation tillage is
defined as any system that leaves 50% or more of the soil covered with residue. 15
Based on the policy design parameters, the schedule for acres to be put into conservation
tillage/no-till cultivation is displayed in Table J-2-1. This table represents the percentage of
cropland required by the policy. The estimate for crops currently in no-till comes from the
Conservation Technology Information Center’s National Crop Residue Management Surveys,
which found that 12% of Arkansas currently employs no-till practices.16
For the policy period, it is assumed that the sequestration rate provided by the Chicago Climate
Exchange for the carbon credit program (0.4 metric tons of carbon dioxide per acre per year
[tCO2/ac/yr], as Arkansas is considered to be 50% in “Zone A” [0.6 tCO2/ac/yr] and 50% in
“Zone D” [0.2 tCO2/ac/yr]) is indicative of the sequestration that would occur as a result of
improved tillage practices. 17 As such, 0.4 tCO2/ac/yr was used to estimate the amount of carbon
to be sequestered.
Additional GHG savings from reduced fossil fuel consumption are estimated by multiplying the
fossil diesel emission factor and diesel fuel reduction per acre estimate. The reduction in fossil
diesel fuel use from the adoption of conservation tillage methods is 3.5 gallons (gal)/ac. 18 The
life-cycle fossil diesel GHG emission factor of 12.31 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(tCO2e)/1,000 gal was used. 19 Results are shown in Table J-2-1, along with a total estimated
benefit from both carbon sequestration and fossil fuel reductions.
It is assumed that there is no reduction in crop yield as a result of implementing conservation
tillage practices.

15

The definitions of tillage practices from the Conservation Technology Information Center are used under this
policy. However, only no-till/strip-till and ridge-till are considered “conservation tillage” practices. No-till means
leaving the residue from last year’s crop undisturbed until planting. Strip-till means no more than one-third of the
row width is disturbed with a coulter, residue manager, or specialized shank that creates a strip. If shanks are used,
nutrients may be injected at the same time. Ridge-till means that 4–6-inch-high ridges are formed at cultivation.
Planters using specialized attachments scrape off the top 2 inches of the ridge before placing the seed in the ground.

The costs of adopting soil management practices (e.g., conservation tillage/no-till practices) are
based on cost estimates from the Minnesota Agriculture Best Management Practices (AgBMP)
program. 20 This program provides farmers a low-interest loan as an incentive to initiate or
improve their current tillage practices. The equipment funded is generally specialized tillage or
planting implements that leave crop residues covering at least 15%–30% of the ground after
planting. The average total cost for this equipment is $23,000, though the average loan for tillage
equipment is $16,000. The average-size farm using an AgBMP loan to purchase conservation
tillage equipment is 984 acres. The average loan size was determined based on the average size
of a farm in Arkansas (308 acres) 21 and the amount of a loan per acre as estimated in the
Minnesota AgBMP program ($16.26/acre). 22 This put the average loan size at $5,008 to finance

no-till/conservation tillage practices. This loan payment was applied to each new acre entering
the program to determine an approximate cost of encouraging the use of soil management
practices. It was further assumed that carbon credits would be available through future programs
similar to the National Farmers Union Carbon Credit Program 23 or the Iowa Farm Bureau’s
AgraGate Climate Credits Corporation. In addition, the diesel fuel savings were considered as a
reduced cost of the program. The resulting cost-effectiveness of soil carbon management is a
cost savings of about $6/tCO2e. See Table J-2-2 for more details.

Nutrient Efficiency
The GHG benefits of this recommendation are quantified by calculating the CO2e emissions per
kilogram (kg) of nitrogen (N) applied in Arkansas. This uses a figure of the nitrogen emissions
from fertilizer (4.70 kgCO2e/kgN applied), calculated from the Arkansas Inventory and Forecast
(AR I&F). 24 This is then combined with a figure for the life-cycle emissions of nitrogen fertilizer

(0.857 kgCO2e/kgN). 25 Thus, the total CO2e emissions in Arkansas are 5.55 kgCO2e/kgN
applied. The BAU estimate of nitrogen fertilizer use in the Arkansas Inventory and Forecast
(I&F) assumes constant rates of nitrogen application from 2005. To increase nutrient efficiency
by 20%, nitrogen fertilizer use is then reduced from the BAU estimate. This reduction of
nitrogen application is then multiplied by the nitrogen emissions factor to determine the GHG
benefits of this proposed nutrient efficiency policy (see Table J-2-3).

The costs of the nutrient efficiency policy were estimated based on the implementation of a soiltesting policy to optimize fertilizer application. This policy assumes a $20 cost to test a 75-acre
field, with the field tested every 5 years, across all of Arkansas. There are also staffing costs for
the testing and information program ($500,000/year) and the costs of preparing a guidance
document ($75,000). Subtracted from these costs are the savings from reduced fertilizer use,
which results in a net savings over the policy period. See Table J-2-4 for more details.

Key Assumptions: The conservation tillage policy assumes that 0.4 tCO2/ac/yr is a good
estimate for the sequestration that comes from no-till. If this is not an accurate estimate of the
benefits of conservation tillage on Arkansas soils, then this number will need to be changed. Soil
carbon management includes all conservation farming practices that reduce GHG emissions and
increase soil carbon sequestration. Conservation tillage has been used as an example for
quantification purposes, and other options, such as cover crops, different rotations, and perennial
crops, are of equal interest.
It is assumed that there is no reduction in crop yield as a result of implementing conservation
tillage practices. While the impact of conservation tillage on yield is uncertain and dependent on
site-specific conditions, this assumption is based on a study from the University of Arkansas

J-14

Rice Research and Extension Center (RREC). 26 This study indicated that “rice grain yields from
no-till plots were equal-to or greater than those from conventional-till plots in 4 of 6 years.” In
all years grain yields were higher than the state average. In a recent analysis of the economic
returns from this study it was found that "both the tenant and the landlord can benefit monetarily
from no-till management.”
Several other key assumptions include: the carbon sequestration potential is representative of all
the crop systems to which the policy is applied, a 20-year period is used for accumulating the soil
carbon, any potential increase in N2O emissions is not large enough to significantly affect the
estimated CO2 benefits, and cost savings used are representative of average savings to be
achieved across all crop systems.
The nutrient efficiency policy assumes that fertilizer use can be reduced without a decrease in
yield. If yield decreases with reduced fertilizer application, determining both the costs and the
GHG reductions of this policy will be more difficult. BAU fertilizer rates are assumed under
historic fertilizer costs. The current explosion in energy and fertilizer costs may substantially
alter BAU rates.
Key Uncertainties
The rate of no-till practices used is based on the national average, which may not reflect
Arkansas conditions. The costs/acre for no-till management come from the Minnesota AgBMP
program, which may not reflect Arkansas costs/acre.
There are key uncertainties surrounding the potential GHG benefits associated with no-till and
conservation-till practices compared to conventional tillage practices. The soil sequestration rates
associated with land management practices, including conservation tillage, remain extremely
uncertain, and studies (including those by Manley et al.) highlight this uncertainty. Manley et al.
suggest that determining the level of carbon being sequestered is difficult, and further research is
required to clarify this issue. 27
In relation to nitrogen fertilizer use efficiency, it should also be noted that there may be
competing forces between the nitrogen efficiency goal and the tillage goal. For example, if there
is a major shift to no-till, farmers may need to increase nitrogen rates because of reduced
mineralization rates (less aeration and physical disturbance), cooler surface temperatures, and
increased losses from volatilized unincorporated urea. Reduced-tillage systems will also make
capturing nitrogen from manure more difficult.
The impact of conservation tillage on yield is uncertain and dependent on site-specific
conditions. This analysis assumes that the conservation tillage practices result in no reduced
yield. This is based on the above-cited study from the University of Arkansas RREC, which

indicated that rice grain yields from no-till plots were equal to or greater than those from
conventional-till plots.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Soil carbon management (e.g., no-tillage) systems provide a number of important ecological
services, including erosion control and water quality benefits.
Feasibility Issues
!

If changes in management result in decreased crop yields, the net carbon flux can be greater
under the new system, assuming that crop demand remains the same and additional lands are
brought into production. Conversely, if increasing crop yields lead to less land under
cultivation, the overall carbon savings from changes in management will be greater than
when soil carbon sequestration alone is considered.

!

Options to increase carbon can be implemented in the short term, but the amount of carbon
sequestered typically is low initially, then rising for a number of years before tapering off
again as the total potential is achieved. There is also a significant risk that the carbon
sequestered may be released again by natural phenomena or human activities.

!

Practices for conserving carbon affect emissions of other GHGs. Of particular importance is
the interaction of carbon sequestration with N2O emissions, because N2O is such a potent
GHG. In some environs, carbon-sequestration practices, such as reduced tillage, can
stimulate N2O emissions, thereby offsetting part of the benefit. Elsewhere, carbon-conserving
practices may suppress N2O emissions, amplifying the net benefit. Similarly, carbonsequestration practices might affect CH4 emissions if the practice, such as increased use of
forages in rotations, leads to higher livestock numbers. Policies designed to suppress
emission of one GHG need to also consider complex interactions to ensure that net emissions
of total GHGs are reduced.

!

International and domestic interactions of the marketplace have not been considered in the
foregoing cost/benefit analysis. Current escalating energy costs may lead to sharp changes in
crop production practices, while international commodity prices may lead to more intense
crop inputs.

AFW-3. Improved Water Management and Use

Policy Description
Using surface water versus groundwater and decreasing water consumption reduce pumping and
energy consumption, in addition to other ancillary benefits. Implementing best management
practices improves the efficiency of water use. Additionally, excess surface water can lead to
runoff of nitrogen, with subsequent emission of N2O to the atmosphere. Managing and
improving water consumption and nutrients spread on crops will result in a minimal loss of
carbon from the soil. Reusing water can create nutrient management problems, and must be
considered when implemented. Water purification is an energy-intensive process that is an issue
for farmers and land users in addition to other sectors, such as the residential, commercial, and
industrial (RCI) sector (this is related to recommendations under the RCI Technical Work Group
[TWG]). As such, water use in rural, suburban, and urban areas should be included under this
policy recommendation. The impact of catfish farms on GHG emissions could also be
investigated under this recommendation.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Increase the use of surface water for irrigation by 10% by 2025, compared to BAU, offsetting
the need for energy-intensive groundwater (reducing energy consumption associated with
groundwater pumping).
!

Decrease energy use for water purification by 20% in 2025, compared to BAU (includes
efficiency gains from reducing water and energy consumption).

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality, Arkansas Department of
Agriculture, Arkansas Natural Resources Commission, research institutions, and land owners.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Enhance current capabilities/capacities of storing surface water, such that it is available at
appropriate times and in the necessary quantities.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Through Act 341 of 1995, Arkansas has invested significant funding and technical support (in
addition to local and federal funding) toward using surface water as opposed to groundwater.
Three projects currently under way are:
!
!
!

Bayou Metro Water Management District,
Boeuff Tensas Water Management District, and
White River Irrigation District.
J-17

Each of the above projects is in various stages of development toward realizing its goals to use
surface water instead of groundwater for irrigation.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Less energy used to pump water results in reduced CO2 emissions.
N2O: Reductions occur when nitrogen runoff and leaching are reduced. (Runoff and leaching
lead to the formation and emission of N2O.)
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2015, 2025 (MMtCO2e):
! Increased Surface Water: 0.005 and 0.01, respectively.
!

Improved Purification: 0.001 and 0.001, respectively.

Net Cost per tCO2e:
! Increased Surface Water: $835.

Quantification Methods:
Surface Water—This analysis used an Arkansas Natural Resources Commission and U.S.
Geological Survey estimate of the amount of groundwater (6.9 billion gal/day) and surface water
(1.3 billion gal/day) used for irrigation in Arkansas. 28 Thus, by 2025, surface water use will
increase by (10%*1.3 billion gal/day) in this policy. Groundwater and surface water use carry
with them different electricity requirements (1.7 kilowatt-hours [kWh]/1,000 gal for groundwater
and 1.3 kWh/1,000 gal for surface water). Thus, every thousand gallons of water that comes
from surface water saves 0.4 kWh of electricity.29,30 This electricity savings figure is then
multiplied by the emissions factor for electricity (.592 tCO2e/megawatt-hour [MWh]) to get the
metric tons of CO2e saved. Costs were estimated based on Iowa average estimates of
groundwater and surface water costs per 1,000 gal, which came from a publication by the Iowa
Association of Municipal Utilities.31 The costs for the largest groundwater suppliers averaged
$0.56/1,000 gal, while the costs for the largest surface water suppliers averaged $0.72/1,000 gal.
This cost difference ($0.15/1,000 gal) in 2000 was then discounted forward to 2005 dollars, and
multiplied by the number of gallons switched in a given year. See Table J-3-1 for details.
Water Purification—The amount of energy going toward water purification in Arkansas could
not be determined. National electricity consumption for water purification (1.1 million MWh)32
was used as a proxy, and then applied to Arkansas based on the Arkansas percentage of the total

(0.4 kWh/1,000 gal) found in these studies is assumed to reflect Arkansas conditions. Costs from
increased use of surface water come from an Iowa source.39 It is assumed that these costs are
comparable to those in Arkansas.
The water purification recommendation assumes that water purification energy use in Arkansas
occurs at the same rate as the national average. If this is not the case, the costs and benefits will
need to be adjusted. Likewise the 0.8% increase in water purification energy use from the EIA 40
may not reflect Arkansas conditions. The costs of efficiency improvements in water purification
come from a case study in Texas,41 and are assumed to reflect Arkansas efficiency
improvements.
Key Uncertainties
It may not be possible or practical to increase the amount of surface water being used in
Arkansas to the extent that is recommended by this policy recommendation's goal.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Decreasing the rate of groundwater pumping will have benefits in terms of maintaining
underground water reservoirs. Because these reservoirs replenish themselves over a very long
time period, decreasing the consumption of this water could have significant benefits in the
future.
The interrelationships between ecology and hydrology present both challenges and opportunities
to establish more effective management, with input of various stakeholder groups with different
and sometimes conflicting interests: for recreation, wildlife habitat, drainage, water supply, and
residential, industrial, and agricultural uses. Managers not only realize that protection of natural
ecological processes helps protect some of the utilitarian values, but that temporal environmental
variability and disturbance continually shapes and regulates aquatic community structure and
function. Climate change and the integration of the human component into natural ecosystem
management continues to establish new fields of endeavor in applied surface water management.
Feasibility Issues
None identified.

AFW-4. Expanded Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for
Electricity, Heat, or Steam Production

Policy Description
Increasing the amount of biomass available from forests or agriculture for generating electricity
can displace the use of fossil energy sources. This strategy also encourages the capture of waste
heat at facilities using biomass (or fossil fuels), wherever possible. The waste heat could be used
for cogeneration to displace heating costs and fossil fuel use. Local electricity or steam
production yields the greatest net energy payoff.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Agricultural Residues—Increase the use of agricultural residues for electricity, steam, and
heat generation to utilize 5% of available in-state agricultural residue biomass by 2015 and
10% of available biomass by 2025.
!

Forest Residues—Increase the use of forest residues for electricity, steam, and heat
generation to utilize 5% of available biomass by 2015, and 10% of available in-state forest
residue by 2025.

!

Energy Crops—Increase the production of energy crops to produce biomass feedstock for
electricity, steam, and heat generation.

!

Energy From Livestock Manure and Poultry Litter—By 2025, utilize 10% of available
energy from livestock manure and poultry litter for renewable electricity, heat, and steam
generation. [Note potential overlap with AFW-1.]

!

Capture of Waste Heat—By 2025, ensure that facilities using biomass for electricity, heat,
and steam production are capturing and utilizing 10% of waste heat.

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: Agriculture landowners, forest owners and managers, utilities, and energyusing industries.
Other: One land type potentially suitable for energy crop production is marginal agricultural
land. The Arkansas Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provided an estimate of
marginal agricultural land in Arkansas, using a combination of the State Soil Geographic
Databases (STASGO) and Gap Analysis Program (GAP)/Land Use Land Cover (LULC) data.
Soils of capability Classes42 III, IV, and V from STASGO were used as the primary criteria for
42

Soil capability classification shows, in a general way, the suitability of soils for most kinds of field crops. Crops
that require special management are excluded. The soils are grouped according to their limitations for field crops,
the risk of damage if they are used for crops, and how they respond to management. The criteria used in grouping
the soils do not include major and generally expensive land forming that would change slope, depth, or other
characteristics of the soils, nor do they include possible, but unlikely, major reclamation projects. Capability classes
are designated by the numbers I through VIII. The numbers indicate progressively greater limitations and narrower
J-24

marginal lands. Soil capability Classes VI, VII, and VII are economically prohibitive, due to
steepness of slope, depth to bedrock, or other limitation, so were excluded. The data set was
overlaid and clipped using GAP/LULC data to produce marginal lands currently in forest,
pasture, and crop. Acreage data for land use were generated through the 1997 National
Resources Inventory (NRI). This acreage does not include federal agency managed lands or
lands enrolled in federal conservation programs. The results of the above analysis indicate the
following acres of marginal land by land use type:
!

Agriculture: Crops—1,505,300 acres

!

Herbaceous/Pasture/Forage—2,871,700 acres

!

Forestland—7,233,000 acres

Other sources of energy are also potentially available, such as using ammonia from waste water
as a potential source of hydrogen. 43
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Add incentives to encourage energy from biomass. Establish incentives for utilizing
renewable heating fuels (such as tax credits).

!

Plant energy crops so the feedstock is available. Pilot projects may be needed in the near
term to assess the economics of broader-scale commercialization in the long term.

!

Provide outreach and education.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Electric Public Utility Renewable Energy Resources
Act 755 (HB 2812)—The Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC) is authorized to
consider, propose, develop, solicit, approve, implement, and monitor measures by electric public
utilities subject to its jurisdiction that cause customers to incur costs of service and investments
that utilize, generate, or involve clean energy resources or renewable energy resources, or both.
The APSC may encourage or require electric public utilities subject to its jurisdiction to consider
clean energy or renewable energy resources, or both, as part of any resource plan. After proper
notice and hearings, the APSC may approve any clean energy resource or renewable energy
resource that it determines to be in the public interest. If the APSC determines that the cost of a
clean energy resource or renewable energy resource is in the public interest, the APSC may
allow the affected electric public utility to implement a temporary surcharge to recover a portion
of the costs of such a resource until the implementation of new rate schedules in connection with

choices for practical use. Capability classification is not a substitute for interpretations that show suitability and
limitations of groups of soils for rangeland, for woodland, and for engineering purposes.

to replace coal in the RCI and electricity sectors (where coal represents about 49% of electricity
generated in Arkansas). 45
The GHG benefits were calculated by the difference in emissions associated with each of the
input fuels (0.0959 tCO2e/million British thermal units [MMBtu]) for sub-bituminous coal,
0.0539 tCO2e/MMBtu for natural gas, and 0.0019 tCO2e/MMBtu for biomass, including nonCH4 and non-N2O emissions). 46
The amount of biomass utilized by each of the three components (agriculture, forestry, and
energy crops) is illustrated in Tables J-4-1, J-4-2, and J-4-3. The biomass available for energy
crop utilization was assumed to be 437,700 acres. Energy crop production on agricultural land is
assumed to be 5 t/ac/yr based on Graham (1994). 47

Energy From Biomass Costs
The cost calculation has two main components: fuel costs and capital costs. The fuel component is
based on the difference in costs between supply of biomass fuel and the assumed fossil fuel that it
is replacing (i.e., coal). The assumed costs used in the analysis are identified in Table J-4-4.
The costs are calculated by assuming the replacement of coal with biomass. The difference in
costs ($/MMBtu) is multiplied by the amount of coal energy (MMBtu) being replaced by
biomass (see Table J-4-5). The assumed incremental capital costs and operation and maintenance
(O&M) costs are based on the capital costs associated with establishing a biomass plant
compared to a coal plant (as indicated in Table J-4-6). Capital costs and O&M costs were taken
from Table 38 of EIA's 2008 Electricity Market Module. 48 The assumed costs for biomass
included in the module are based on the cost and performance characteristics of new generating
technologies, which in the case of biomass is assumed to be integrated gasification combinedcycle (IGCC) technology. While use of biomass may be pursued through a variety of technology
types (e.g., gasification, cofiring, direct firing) or end uses (e.g., heat, steam), this methodology

The capital costs associated with using biomass as an alternative to fossil-based generation are dependent on many
factors, including the end use (i.e., electricity, heat, or steam), the design and size of the system, the technology
employed, and the configuration specifications of the system. Each system implemented under this policy would
require a detailed analysis (incorporating specific engineering design and cost aspects) to provide a more accurate
cost estimate of the system.

Agricultural Economics (April 2008). Available at: http://ideas.repec.org/p/pae/wpaper/08-03.html. Cost
components include seed, fertilizer, and herbicide application, mowing/shredding, raking, baling, storage, handling,
and transportation in the 30-mile range. The cost estimates also include nutrient replacement for corn stover. The
heat content of selected fuels comes from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Table A.2: Approximate Heat Content of

MMBtu = million British thermal units; MW = megawatt.

The capital infrastructure life span is assumed to be 30 years, and the interest rate is assumed to
be 5%, giving a capital recovery factor of 0.065 (i.e., a $1 million plant is assumed to cost
approximately $65,000/year over the life of the project).
Energy From Livestock Manure and Poultry Litter GHG Benefits
Methane emissions (in MMtCO2e) data from the Arkansas I&F were used as the starting point to
estimate the GHG benefits of capturing and controlling the volumes of methane targeted by the
policy and to include the additional benefit of electricity generation using this captured methane
(through offsetting fossil-based generation). The first portion of GHG benefit is obtained through
reduced methane emissions through the capture of emissions from manure and poultry litter. An
assumed collection efficiency of 75% 58 was applied to methane emissions from manure and
poultry litter, which was then multiplied by the assumed policy target, ramping up to achieve
10% collection by 2025.
58

The collection efficiency is an assumed value based on engineering judgment. No applicable studies were
identified that provided information on methane collection efficiencies achieved using manure digesters (as it relates
to collection of entire farm-level emissions).

J-33

The second portion of the GHG benefit is obtained through the offsetting of fossil-based
electricity generation. This was estimated by converting the methane captured in each year to its
heat content (in Btus), and then multiplying by an energy recovery factor of 17,100 Btu/kWh to
estimate the electricity produced (assumes a 25% efficiency for conversion to electricity in an
engine and generator set). The CO2e associated with this amount of electricity in each year was
estimated by converting the kWh to MWh, and then multiplying this value by the Arkansasspecific emissions. The emissions factor for grid electricity was derived from the Arkansas I&F
by dividing total electricity consumption emissions in 2005 by electricity sales in 2005. This
provided an electricity emissions factor of 0.592 tCO2e/MWh.
The total GHG benefit was estimated as the sum of both portions of the benefits described above
and indicated in Table J-4-8.

Energy From Livestock Manure and Poultry Litter Costs
The costs for the dairy and swine components were estimated using the NRCS analysis An
Analysis of Energy Production Costs From Anaerobic Digestion Systems on U.S. Livestock

J-34

Production Facilities. 59 The production costs were assumed to be $0.11/kWh for swine
anaerobic digesters and $0.05/kWh for dairy anaerobic digesters.60 These costs are in 2006
dollars and assume a 30% thermal efficiency. They include annualized capital costs for the
digester, generator, and O&M. 61 The assumed costs for the poultry component were taken from
Flora and Riahi-Nezhad’s Availability of Poultry Manure as a Potential Bio-Fuel Feedstock for
Energy Production ($0.103/kWh in 2005 dollars using anaerobic digestion). 62 The value of
electricity produced was taken from the all-sector average projected electricity price for the
Southeastern Electric Reliability Council from EIA’s AEO2008. 63 This price represents the
value to the farmer for the electricity produced (to offset on-farm use) and is netted out from the
production costs to estimate net costs. Total production costs are presented in Table J-4-9.

It was assumed that the technology employed for both swine and dairy anaerobic digesters was covered anaerobic
lagoon. Costs were obtained from Table 1 of the NRCS economic analysis cited above.
61

The economic analysis conducted by Beddoes et al. does not include feedstock and digester effluent transportation
costs. It also does not address the economics of centralized digesters where biomass is collected from several farms
and then processed in a single unit.

Capture of Waste Heat GHG Benefits
The amount of biomass being used for electricity production was determined using eGRID (257
MW). 64 This was then converted into MWh and then into MMBtu, based on the amount of
biomass feedstock necessary to produce 1 MWh of energy. 65 The amount of usable (waste) heat
available from a biomass plant is estimated to be 60% of biomass inputs, so this total MMBtu
figure is multiplied by 60% to get the amount of energy that is lost as waste heat.66 This heat is
then captured at an increasing rate across the program, with 10% captured in 2025, as per the
policy goal. This heat is assumed to go toward commercial heating, with 92% efficiency in
transportation. 67 Assuming that natural gas boilers are 85% efficient,68 we can determine the

Capture of Waste Heat Costs
To determine the costs of installing cogeneration in Arkansas, we first determine the amount of
capacity that will need to be modified with CHP. This is then multiplied by the capital costs of
installing these modifications ($1,148/kW). 70 O&M costs of $1.10/MWh are then multiplied by
the total CHP production for the given year, which is then combined with capital costs to get

total costs. 71 Cost savings come from the revenue of steam sold to the plant making an
investment in CHP. Due to the difficulty of determining a market price for steam heat, this is
assumed to be equal to the cost of the natural gas it is replacing. 72 This was determined by
multiplying the amount of natural gas avoided by the cost of 1 MMBtu of natural gas. See Table

Key Assumptions:
It is uncertain how willing and able farmers will be to develop on-site projects (i.e., the technical
expertise of farmers in energy utilization or electricity production). It is anticipated that it would
be difficult to convince poultry farmers to adopt energy generation on site. Off-site cooperative
and regional energy-generating facilities may be more viable.

In “Poultry Litter to Energy: Technical and Economic Feasibility,”73 Bock notes that poultry
litter is a more challenging fuel than wood for several reasons, including “that the nitrogen
content is about 10 times higher in poultry litter than wood. This increases the potential for fuel
nitrogen oxide emissions and requires special measures to reduce these emissions. The sulfur
content of poultry litter is more than 10 times higher than that of wood. High chloride levels, in
conjunction to [sic] high alkali levels, increase the potential for particulate emissions, corrosion
problems, and acid gas emissions, and require special measures. Ash levels are much higher in
poultry litter than in wood, requiring higher-volume ash-handling equipment and more attention
to particulate removal, slagging, and fouling.” These factors indicate that emission control
measures may be more elaborate and more expensive on systems utilizing poultry litter
compared to other feedstocks.
It is assumed that the biomass plants installing CHP have a market for steam readily available. If
steam must be transported long distances, that will reduce both the cost-effectiveness and the
environmental benefits of CHP. In addition, many of the costs of CHP installation are from sites
dedicated to CHP, rather than sites where generation is already in place and capture of waste heat
is being installed.
The costs of CHP mostly come from installing CHP in new biomass power plants, rather than
retrofitting currently existing biomass plants to include a CHP component. This could make a
significant difference in the cost-effectiveness of CHP.
Key Uncertainties
The capital costs associated with using biomass as an alternative to fossil-based generation are
dependent on many factors, including the end use (i.e., electricity, heat, or steam), the design and
size of the system, the technology employed, and the configuration specifications of the system.
Each system implemented under this policy would require a detailed analysis (incorporating
specific engineering design and costs aspects) to provide a more accurate cost estimate of the
system. Similar issues also surround the production of energy from livestock manure and poultry
litter.
The fuel mix being replaced by biomass is assumed to be 100% coal. Biomass is assumed to
have a reduction of 0.0940 tCO2e/MMBtu when replacing coal combustion. Methane utilization
is assumed to replace electricity.
The price of biomass as an energy feedstock is relatively uncertain, particularly as the prices for
alternative uses change (e.g., food or feed). It is likely that forest products will be cheaper than
agricultural residue or energy crops. For all biomass feedstock sources, collection and
transportation will represent a significant component of delivered feedstock price.
The analysis assumes that biomass replaces coal. While the generation characteristics of biomass
may lend themselves to the replacement of coal, the feedstock price suggests that biomass
generation is more likely to be dispatched at the margin, where it is likely to be displacing
higher-cost/lower-emission sources, such as natural gas. Displacement of natural gas (rather than

coal) will most likely reduce both emission savings and the total cost of implementing the
recommendation.
The future price of electricity will affect the analysis.
Additional Benefits and Costs
The expansion of crops as an energy feedstock needs to ensure that the energy crops are grown
on appropriate land and in ways that do not damage terrestrial or aquatic resources or displace
food and fiber production.
The use of mixed grasslands native to Arkansas as an alternative to switchgrass monocultures
can provide additional benefits, such as improved or increased wildlife habitat, and may allow
for ecosystems to better adapt to any future impacts of climate change. Additionally, the
conversion of wetlands could reduce or remove the contribution that wetlands make to flood
control, groundwater replenishment, storm protection, sediment and nutrient retention and
export, and wildlife habitat.
Feasibility Issues
Many existing power plants, including biomass plants, are located some distance from
population centers so as to avoid concerns of local air pollution. This makes establishing CHP
more difficult, because the heat will need to be transported a greater distance.
The feasibility of installing digesters on a small-scale farm is uncertain, and the costs may make
this unattractive. Digester facilities tend to require a critical number of animals before the
projects are feasible. As such, implementation at the community or cooperative scale may be
more feasible and realistic.

AFW-5. Expanded Production and Use of Advanced Biofuels

Policy Description
This strategy increases production of advanced biofuels from agriculture and/or forestry
feedstocks (raw materials) to displace the use of conventional petroleum-based fuels. It promotes
the development of emerging biofuel technologies (such as cellulosic ethanol technologies) and
biofuel production systems that use renewable fuels to improve the embedded energy content of
biofuel. Increased in-state production and consumption result in the highest benefits.
Policy Design
Goals: Increase the production of liquid advanced biofuels in Arkansas, such that by 2025 the
state utilizes approximately 10% of available biomass supply per year to produce advanced
biofuels with significantly lower embedded GHG emissions compared to conventional fuel
products (from a life-cycle perspective).
Timing: The above goal identifies a time frame to achieve the final utilization goal. However,
the Governor’s Commission on Global Warming (GCGW) has suggested that the Agriculture,
Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW) TWG investigate the level of development of relevant
biofuel technologies. Using this information, the AFW TWG should determine an appropriate
commercialization pathway for Arkansas, including identifying when the technology will most
likely become commercially available.
Parties Involved: Agriculture land owners, forest owners and managers, biofuel producers and
large fuel distributors, retailers, and users.
Other: The intent of this recommendation is to focus on non-food biomass resources.
According to the U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, advanced biofuel “means
renewable fuel, other than ethanol derived from corn starch, that has lifecycle greenhouse gas
emissions, as determined by the Administrator, after notice and opportunity for comment, that
are at least 50 percent less than baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.” 74 The bill
stipulates that “the types of fuels eligible for consideration as `advanced biofuel’ may include
any of the following:
“(I) Ethanol derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin.
“(II) Ethanol derived from sugar or starch (other than corn starch).
“(III) Ethanol derived from waste material, including crop residue, other vegetative waste
material, animal waste, and food waste and yard waste.
“(IV) Biomass-based diesel.
74

See Section 201—Definitions. The text of the bill is available from the Library of Congress—Thomas, at
http://thomas.loc.gov/home/c110query.html, by searching for “Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007.”

“(V) Biogas (including landfill gas and sewage waste treatment gas) produced through the
conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass.
“(VI) Butanol or other alcohols produced through the conversion of organic matter from
renewable biomass.
“(VII) Other fuel derived from cellulosic biomass.”75
Implementation Mechanisms
!

Incorporate a low-carbon index for biofuels production, along with feedstock sustainability
standards.

!

Create efficiency incentives for ethanol facilities to upgrade their equipment to consume less
heat and power

!

Implement a life-cycle certification/labeling process for low-carbon fuels.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Alternative Fuels Development Program
Act 873 (HB 1379): The act creates the Arkansas Alternative Fuels Development Program, to be
administered by the Arkansas Agriculture Department, with the purpose of providing grant
incentives for alternative fuel producers and distributors, and feedstock processors. The act also
creates the Arkansas Alternative Fuels Development Fund, and repeals obsolete sections of the
Arkansas Code related to alternative fuels.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Life-cycle emissions are reduced to the extent that biofuels are produced with lower
embedded fossil-based carbon than conventional (fossil) fuel. Feedstocks used for producing
biofuels can be made from crops or other biomass that contain carbon sequestered during
photosynthesis (e.g., biogenic or short-term carbon).
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2015, 2025 (MMtCO2e): 1.4 and 2.2, respectively.
Net Cost per tCO2e: $6.

Quantification Methods:
Biofuel GHG Reductions
For this policy recommendation, several different technologies can be used to meet the policy
goal, including cellulosic ethanol, pyrolysis, Fischer-Tropsch esterification, and others. The
GHG reduction as well as the cost will depend on the feedstock and conversion technology used.
For the purpose of quantification, it is assumed that cellulosic ethanol production via
fermentation will be used to meet the policy goal. An example of an additional feedstock type
that could be used to meet the goal is producing biodiesel from algae.
For cellulosic ethanol, the benefits for this recommendation are dependent on developing in-state
production capacity that achieves benefits beyond petroleum fuels.
The incremental benefit of cellulosic production targeted by this policy over gasoline is 9.79
tCO2e reduced/1,000 gal. The emission factor value is based on the difference between the lifecycle CO2e emission factor of gasoline (10.30 t/1,000 gal) 77 and the life-cycle CO2e emission
factor of cellulosic ethanol (1.38 t/1,000 gal). 78 Emission factors for gasoline and cellulosic
ethanol are based on the Argonne National Laboratory GREET model. 79 The cellulosic benefit
value will be used along with the production in each year to estimate GHG reductions.
Table J-5-1 shows the number of cellulosic plants that will need to go on line in Arkansas to
achieve the goal of using 10% of biomass available in Arkansas (2.19 million short tons)
annually by 2025, according to the Arkansas Biomass Resource Assessment. 80 Annual cellulose
production is multiplied by the estimated ethanol yield per ton of biomass, based on the
projection that ethanol yield will increase from 70 gal/ton biomass to 90 gal/ton biomass by 2012
and to 100 gal/ton biomass by 2020, as shown in Table J-5-1. 81 This analysis is primarily based
on a report from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) regarding the capital costs
of building a 69.3-million gal/year cellulosic ethanol plant that uses corn stover as the
feedstock. 82 The emission reductions from this plant are calculated by multiplying the number of
gallons produced in a given year by the emission reductions per gallon (9.79 tCO2e/1,000 gal).

Biofuel Costs
The costs of this recommendation are estimated based on the capital and operating costs of
cellulosic ethanol production plants. An NREL study estimated total capital costs for a 70million gal/year cellulosic ethanol plant would be $200 million.83 An EIA study cited a major
biofuels manufacturer who estimated the costs of a first-of-its-kind 50-million gal/year cellulosic
ethanol plant to be $375 million.84 An average of these costs was used in our estimate of capital
costs. A new plant will need to be built for every 70 million gallons of annual ethanol production
needed. It was assumed that the capital costs will be paid according to a cost recovery factor over
the 20-year lifetime of the plant. O&M costs were also taken from the NREL study. The cost of
biomass feedstocks made up a significant portion (~60%) of variable costs. Therefore, we
replaced the NREL estimate of feedstock costs ($30/ton) with a more current estimate of the cost
of delivered biomass ($74/ton). 85 The plant proposed by the NREL study produces some excess

electricity that is sold back to the grid by the plant. Another revenue source for the ethanol plant
is the value of the ethanol produced. The wholesale price of ethanol was taken from AEO2008,
and is multiplied by the number of gallons produced annually. 86 Table J-5-2 outlines the
estimated cost and revenue streams for the policy. The analysis shows a profit being made in the
production of ethanol for several years in the policy period. This is primarily due to the
increasing price of ethanol predicted. The total cost of the policy for 2008–2025 is estimated to
be $114 million.

Key Assumptions: Advanced biofuel production is assumed to ramp up linearly from zero
production in 2008, to full implementation of the policy goal by 2025.
For the purpose of initial quantification, it is assumed that cellulosic ethanol production via
fermentation will be used to meet the policy goal. This quantification may be updated, however,
as other technologies are considered.

Key Uncertainties
The cost competitiveness of biofuels will depend on the cost of oil.
Algae may be able to serve as a sustainable feedstock; it is unknown how much of this feedstock
will be cultivated in Arkansas.
Carbon Emissions From Land-Use Change: Recent publications, such as Searchinger et al.
2008, 87 have attempted to estimate the carbon emissions that result from land use being
converted to cropland to grow crops for fuel. This is based on the argument that the conversion
of current cropland from food/feed/fiber production in one part of the world will drop the
food/feed/fiber supply on the market and drive grassland or forest conversion to cropland in
other parts of the world. There is still significant uncertainty regarding the value of carbon
emissions due to land-use change. Additionally, conversion of cropland to fuel production may
have impacts on food prices and supply.
Cost of Cellulosic Ethanol Production: EIA has stated: “Capital costs for a first-of-a-kind
cellulosic ethanol plant with a capacity of 50 million gallons per year are estimated by one
leading producer to be $375 million (2005 dollars), as compared with $67 million for a cornbased plant of similar size, and investment risk is high for a large-scale cellulosic ethanol
production facility. Other studies have provided lower cost estimates. A detailed study by the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2002 estimated total capital costs for a cellulosic
ethanol plant with a capacity of 69.3 million gallons per year at $200 million.”88
In June 2006, the U.S. Senate was told that the current cost of producing cellulosic ethanol is
U.S. $2.25/U.S. gal. This is primarily due to the current poor conversion efficiency. At that price,
it would cost about $120 to substitute a barrel of oil (42 gal), taking into account the lower
energy content of ethanol. However, DOE is optimistic and has requested a doubling of research
funding. The same Senate hearing was told that the research target was to reduce the cost of
production to U.S. $1.07/U.S. gal by 2012.
Additional Benefits and Costs
There is potential for the cultivation of biomass resources to compete with the production of
food. For example, land that could be cultivated for food crops might be converted to energy
crop production. Additionally, some feedstocks, such as oilseeds, could be diverted from food to
fuel production. The intent of this policy is to focus on nonfood feedstocks. Analysis provided by
DOE Secretary Bodman and USDA Secretary Schafer suggests that the impact of biofuels on
food prices and demand is minimal. 89 They state that:

“In 2007, the expansion in ethanol and biodiesel consumption is estimated to have increased the Consumer
Price Index (CPI) for all food by 0.10–0.15 percentage point. In other words, ethanol and biodiesel
consumption accounted for approximately 3–4 percent of the overall rise in retail food prices.
“Increased demand for biofuel feedstocks has benefited com and soybean producers. Higher prices have
encouraged production increases and some switching of acreage from soybeans to com. More dried distiller
grains are available for feed, but higher grain prices are also prompting adjustments by livestock producers.
In future years, production adjustments by livestock and dairy producers in response to higher feed costs
resulting from the expansion in ethanol and biodiesel consumption could add a total of 0.6–0.7 percentage
point to the CPI for all food.
“Commodities prices, both agricultural and nonagricultural, have risen sharply in recent years for a number
of reasons unrelated to biofuels development. For agricultural commodities, higher incomes, population
growth, and depreciation of the dollar are increasing the demand for food; drought and dry weather have
lowered production and reduced stocks; and some countries have imposed export restrictions. All these
factors contribute to higher commodity prices. In addition, record prices for gasoline and diesel fuel are
increasing the costs of producing, transporting, and processing food products.”90

Other Benefits and Costs: Cellulosic ethanol could have less of an impact than corn ethanol on
water quality and could actually reduce nutrient loads in some circumstances; could provide
permanent new sources of income for farmers and foresters; could use current waste streams to
replace U.S. fuel consumption; could result in environmental benefits or costs; could provide
recycling money in local economies; could stimulate potential markets for other biomass
feedstocks (forest treatment biomass, municipal solid waste fiber); could increase transportation
energy security with shorter transport distances and on-farm use of fuel produced; and could
reduce reliance on imported petroleum.
Feasibility Issues
Implementation of this recommendation requires additional research and development in
cellulosic ethanol production methods, development of feedstock collection and delivery
infrastructure, and successful negotiations with cellulosic technology leaders to establish pilotand commercial-scale plants in the state. Sourcing of feedstocks and the size and location of
facilities (both crushing and biodiesel production) must be addressed for optimization and
planning. Trade-offs between food and fuel crops will be an important issue.
There may be an overlap among agricultural recommendations that seek to increase/maintain
crop acreage in no-till production or in conservation management programs. This could be in
conflict with the higher levels of crop production proposed in this recommendation.

AFW-6. Expanded Use of Locally Produced Farm and Forest Products

Policy Description
The production and consumption of locally produced agricultural goods displace the
consumption of goods transported from other states or countries, and thus reduce transportationrelated GHG emissions. Increasing the amount of renewable wood products used for residential
and commercial buildings can increase carbon sequestration in wood products and displace GHG
emissions associated with processing high-energy input materials, such as steel, plastic, and
concrete. Also, using locally grown wood can lower transportation-associated GHG emissions.
Policy Design
This policy recommendation places responsibility on local governments to be part of the solution
by ensuring that zoning does not preclude intelligent, sustainable uses that support this objective,
such as constraining local value-added mills or limiting the location of or participation in local
markets.
Goals:
! Local Produce—By 2025, of the food Arkansans consume, 30% will consist of locally91
grown produce and fish, meats, and poultry.
!

Locally Grown and Processed Wood Products—
Increase the use of wood as a building product to displace products with higher embodied
energy, such as concrete and steel.
! Displace the amount of imported wood products with locally grown and processed

!

Timing: As described above.
Parties Involved: University of Arkansas System, Extension, USDA.
Other: A “wood product” includes composite lumber and products with recycled content.
Implementation Mechanisms
To achieve the local produce goal, a number of actions could and should be taken within
Arkansas, including the continued promotion of farmers’ markets in the state, an enhanced
information and research program, and a re-evaluation of the most appropriate land use
within Arkansas. Each of these is outlined below:
!

Farmers’ Markets—Increase the number of local farmers’ markets in Arkansas from 54 to 65
(or 20% increase) by 2025, thereby increasing market access to locally and regionally grown
fresh produce and fish, meats, and poultry products.

91

There is currently no universally accepted definition of “locally grown.” For the purposes of the local produce
goal, a distance of less than 100–150 miles is considered to be local.

J-48

!

Information—By 2010, the state, in coordination with the University of Arkansas System,
Extension, USDA, and others, will collect and analyze data on the number of acres in
Arkansas converted to local food production systems, and, to the extent practical, evaluate
the positive economic and environmental impacts on Arkansas farmers, communities, and the
state as a whole.

!

Land Use—By 2025, convert 10% of existing Arkansas agricultural land to locally based
food systems, and convert another 5% of rural and urban nonagricultural land to gardens,
saving emissions from reduced petroleum-based transportation, packaging, refrigeration,
marketing, and production costs.

In additional there is the potential for the extension of programs, such as farmers’ markets, farm
to school, community-supported agriculture share programs, 4-H Youth Development,
community gardens, extension programs, and home gardening. Incentives could also be provided
for buying products made from recycled materials.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Energy and Natural Resource Conservation Act—The act encourages the use of wood in green
buildings and requires certain state buildings to meet specified environmental construction
standards (AR Code 22-3-1801). The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green
Building Rating System™ (LEED) was reformed in Arkansas to explicitly encourage the use of
wood products in green buildings. (Previously it was eligible, but not encouraged.) Initiated by
the Arkansas legislature and subsequently adopted by a number of other states, this reform
specifically includes the use of products that promote the sequestration of carbon.
Increasing the number of farmers’ markets in the state, as well as encouraging existing ones to
grow, are major goals for the Arkansas Agriculture Department. The Agriculture Department has
an ongoing program financed by block grants from USDA. Participants in the program total 54
markets, some of which are relatively small. The Agriculture Department has organized an
Arkansas Farmers' Market Association, which has 32 members, mostly representing the larger
markets. Encouraging multi-county regional markets in some locations, such as Hot Springs,
provides a greater opportunity for a larger variety of home-grown products over a longer period
of time.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Extends carbon sequestration in durable wood products and wood construction. Maintains
carbon sequestration in healthy forests. Avoids emissions through reduced transportation miles,
refrigeration, and use of high-energy-input construction materials.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2015, 2025 (MMtCO2e): 0.03 and 0.06, respectively.
Net Cost per tCO2e: $4.

Data Sources: Estimates of harvested acres were taken from the National Agricultural Statistics
Service agricultural census publication for Arkansas. 92 Crop yields were provided by Craig R.
Andersen, Extension Horticulture Specialist–Vegetables, Department of Horticulture, University
of Arkansas U.S. per capita consumption rates were obtained from the USDA Economic
Research Service Food Consumption (Per Capita) Data System. 93 Arkansas population data were
obtained from the Center for Climate Strategies AR I&F.
Quantification Methods:
Local Produce
The amount of each crop produced in Arkansas was estimated using harvested acres and
estimates of crop yields per acre. The amount of each crop consumed in Arkansas was estimated
using U.S. per capita consumption rates and the Arkansas population.
The amount consumed for each crop was then subtracted from the amount produced to determine
how much of the crop was imported. For each imported crop, a likely state of origin was
assumed. The estimated amount of imports for each crop and the estimated round-trip mileage
were used to estimate ton-miles transported and CO2 emissions.
Transportation emissions were estimated by assuming 23 tons of payload per truck, 6 truck-miles
per gallon of diesel fuel, and 22.4 pounds (lb) of CO2 per gallon of diesel fuel. To estimate miles
traveled, food from California was assumed to travel from Fresno, California, to Little Rock
(~1,700 miles). These mileage estimates were then doubled, since it was assumed that each truck
would return to its point of origin empty. The amount of food produced and exported is assumed
to remain constant, while consumption is assumed to grow with population. The GHG benefits
were estimated by reducing the imported food and increasing consumption of locally produced
food by the proportion described by the policy goal, ramping up to achieve 30% local
consumption by 2025.
Costs were based on the estimated need for one additional full-time-equivalent (FTE) employee
employed by the state (e.g., Arkansas Agriculture Department) to implement the elements of this
policy. The total cost for this additional FTE is $75,000, escalated using a salary escalation rate
of 4% per year. Some of the elements of this policy could be incorporated into existing
programs, but it is assumed that program costs of $100,000 (at an escalation rate of 4%) are
required to implement a buy-local program. 94 These funds could be used to stimulate local
programs, such as the establishment of an Arkansas buy-local brand, education programs for
growers in food safety and agriculture handling, the promotion of farmers markets, or additional
labor to produce local products.

Locally Grown and Processed Wood Products
The science is very clear and compelling that wood products contain much less embodied energy
than other building materials and, unlike other building materials, function as long-term
sequesters of carbon. Additionally, wood products sourced locally have additional energy and
carbon advantages compared to products transported from distant sources.
For example, a lumber framed wall or floor system requires just 40% of the fossil fuel energy
needed to manufacture a concrete wall or floor system and only 20% of the fossil fuel energy
need to manufacture a steel wall or floor (Boyer et al., 2008). Table J-6-2 displays the fossil fuel
consumption needed to manufacture wall assemblies of wood and steel in a typical cold-climate
setting. Selecting the lumber wall instead of the steel wall achieves a 24% reduction in fossil fuel
consumption per square foot. Table J-6-3 displays a similar comparison between wood and
concrete in a typical warm-climate setting. If the lumber wall design is selected instead of the
concrete wall, fossil fuel consumption is reduced by 60%. Table J-6-4 shows that selecting a
dimension wood joist floor instead of a concrete slab or steel joist floor system results in
respective reductions in fossil fuel consumption of 60% and 79%.

Manufacturing a ton of concrete and a ton of steel produces net carbon emissions of 265 kgC/t
and 220 kgC/t, respectively, compared to just 33 kgC/t for framing lumber (Table J-6-5).
However, wood is 50% carbon by content, so the net carbon emissions for manufacturing a ton

The data also indicate that actively managed forests sequester more carbon and thus play an
important role in offsetting GHG emissions. Because wood products store carbon, and because
actively managed forest stands with periodic harvests sequester carbon at an increased rate
relative to unmanaged stands, more carbon is sequestered over time when periodic harvests occur
and wood products are produced and utilized (Perez-Garcia et al. 106 ).

AFW-7 includes an analysis that incorporates the sequestration benefits from actively managed
forests, including the benefits associated with harvested wood products.
Key Assumptions:
! The amount of each crop consumed in Arkansas was estimated using U.S. per capita
consumption rates and the Arkansas population.
!

Transportation emissions were estimated by assuming 23 tons of payload per truck, 6 truckmiles/gal of diesel fuel, and 22.4 lb of CO2/gal of diesel fuel.

Key Uncertainties
One uncertainty is the amount of food products leaving the state. State export/import data were
not available. As such, the above analysis does not include state-to-state exports.
Also, this analysis does not take into account the portion of some crops that may be shipped out
of Arkansas when they are in season, and imported into the state when they are not in season.
The benefits were quantified at the state level. As such, they do not capture additional GHG
benefits where local (e.g., community-level) production and consumption take place (resulting in
addition ton-mile reductions). The quantified benefits could also be conservatively low, since the
assumptions for out-of-state-produce were based on California as the likely producer state. Many
commodities come from farther away (including foreign countries) and can travel by more
energy-intensive methods (e.g., air transport). Further, the assumed transport routes are a single
trip from the city of origin to Little Rock. Many commodities will make several trips prior to
reaching their final point of consumption (for packaging, storage, processing, etc.).
This analysis only incorporates emission reductions due to reduced transportation. Other
environmental and economic benefits associated with localizing packaging, refrigeration,
storage, and processing are not included. The overall impact of all of the assumptions is that the
benefits are likely to be underestimated.
It is assumed that the fuel savings accrued through reduced ton-miles offset the likely increase in
production costs associated with more localized food production. While the exact interaction of
these competing economic factors is uncertain, locally produced and consumed food products
will become more cost-effective as fuel costs increase.

AFW-7. Forest Management and Establishment for Carbon Sequestration

Policy Description
Arkansas is blessed with abundant and expanding forests—approximately 18.52 million acres,
mostly in private ownership, covering 54% of the state. Arkansas’ forests and forest management
have a significant role to play in the state’s strategies to reduce or offset GHGs and adapt to
future climate effects. Nationally, managed forests and forest products store enough carbon each
year to offset approximately 10% of U.S. CO2 emissions.
Arkansas’ forests naturally sequester GHGs (producing 1.07 metric tons of oxygen for every
1.47 metric tons of CO2 absorbed through the power of photosynthesis) and produce biomass for
alternative fuels, wood-building products, and paper containing sequestered carbon. Beyond
atmospheric and economic benefits, a healthy forest also provides wildlife habitat, enhanced
water quality, recreation, and an aesthetically pleasing backdrop for the Natural State tourism
promotion. On the other hand, conversion of forests to other land uses, poor forest health, natural
decay, and wildfires reduce the sequestration and carbon storage values of the forests, as well as
the potential economic values of forest products and carbon sequestration in regulated CO2 offset
markets.
This policy recommendation establishes or re-establishes forests on land not currently forested,
such as fallow or marginal agricultural land (“afforestation”); promotes retaining forest cover
and associated carbon stocks by regenerating forests (“reforestation” or “restoration”); helps
maintain and improve the health and longevity of trees in urban and residential areas (urban
forestry); and implements, in a carbon-sensitive manner, such practices as site preparation,
erosion control, and stand stocking to ensure conditions that support forest growth. Forest
management activities promote forest productivity and increase the rate of CO2 sequestration in
forest biomass and soils and in harvested wood products. Also, specific trees could be selected
that sequester other non-GHG chemicals in addition to sequestering CO2. Practices may include
planting open land, replanting harvested land, increased stocking of poorly stocked lands,
extending the age of managed stands, thinning, fertilizing, recycling waste, expanding the short
rotation of woody crops (for fiber and energy), expanding the use of genetically preferred
species, modifying biomass removal practices, managing and reducing the risk of, pests and
disease and managing and reducing the risk of intense wildfire through the appropriate use of
controlled burning.
Policy Design
Goals:
! Implement urban tree-planting and -retention programs in Arkansas urban areas. Plant
100,000 additional trees each year between 2009 and 2025, resulting in 1.7 million new trees
in urban areas statewide (or a 4% increase in the number of urban trees).
!

Implement sustainable forest management practices to achieve carbon benefits on 25% of
privately owned land by 2025.

J-55

!

Implement sustainable forest management practices to achieve carbon benefits on 17% of
publicly owned resource lands by 2025.

!

Maintain existing forest cover by replanting harvested acres; restoring timbered acres lost to
insects, wildfire, or natural causes; and establishing a net 500,000 new acres of forest by
2025.

The above goals were based on land area information from the NRCS National Resources
Inventory and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis
National Program. This information is displayed in Tables J-7-1 and J-7-2. Table J-7-3 indicates

Other:
Sustainable Forestry Definition—To meet the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their own needs by practicing a land stewardship ethic that
integrates reforestation and the managing, growing, nurturing, and harvesting of trees for useful
products with the conservation of soil, air and water quality, biological diversity, wildlife and
aquatic habitat, recreation, and aesthetics.
While wildfire can have negative consequences on ecosystems and GHG emissions, prescribed
burning can have both ecosystem and GHG benefits through reduced wildfire intensity. The
GCGW supports the appropriate use of prescribed burning.
Implementation Mechanisms
Arkansas should redouble its efforts to promote reforestation, forest restoration, and new
afforestation on lands in public as well as private ownership. It can do so by:
!

Ensuring that forest landowners are eligible for CO2 offset credits and incentives in any state,
regional, or national market-based initiatives.

!

Providing financial and legislative incentives to landowners (in addition to offset market
revenue) to increase carbon sequestration and storage.

!

Supporting the development of market demand for forest biomass for energy (electricity and
fuels) in lieu of fossil fuel energy.

!

Taking a leadership role in regional and national policy development and efforts to
encourage the participation of all forest landowners in ways that provide increased climate
benefits.

Education and outreach, especially for citizens and land managers, will also be an important part
of this goal, both to underscore the importance of forests and to teach forest management
practices that promote carbon sequestration.
Minimum standards or best practice standards with certification could be used to promote
sustainable forest management practices, which include the promotion of carbon benefits.
The implementation of this recommendation should consider non-GHG benefits, such as the
provision of wildlife habitat, biodiversity, stream buffers, and water quality.

Quantification Methods:
Urban Forestry GHG Benefit
Carbon Sequestration in Urban Trees

Approximately 43,412,000 urban trees currently grow in Arkansas, resulting in an average of
25% canopy cover in urban areas statewide. 107 Planting 100,000 additional trees each year
between 2009 and 2025 would add 1.7 million trees in urban areas statewide, for a 3.9% increase
in the number of trees, and boost the canopy cover in urban areas to about 26%.
The average annual per-tree gross carbon sequestration value for urban trees was found by dividing
the total estimated annual carbon sequestration in Arkansas urban trees (258,000 metric tons of
carbon/year, equating to 946,000 tCO2e/yr) by the total number of urban trees. Annual gross carbon
sequestration per urban tree was thus calculated as 0.006 metric tons of carbon (0.022 tCO2e) per
tree per year. Gross sequestration as calculated above does not account for the emissions resulting
from tree mortality, disposal, and decomposition. To account for these emissions, the estimated
gross carbon sequestration per tree was multiplied by 0.72, which is the ratio of gross to net
sequestration for urban trees reported by Nowak and Crane (2002) 108 and used in EPA’s Inventory
of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. 109 Annual net carbon sequestration per urban tree in
Arkansas is 0.004 metric tons of carbon (0.015 tCO2e) per tree per year.
Since trees planted in one year continue to accumulate carbon in subsequent years, annual carbon
sequestration in any given year was calculated as the sum of carbon stored in trees planted in that
year, plus sequestration by trees that were planted in prior years. It was assumed that new trees
planted in urban areas in Arkansas would sequester carbon at a rate consistent with sequestration
by the average urban tree statewide.

Avoided Fossil Fuel Emissions

GHG reductions from avoided fossil fuel use for heating and cooling can occur as a result of
planting trees that provide additional shade and wind protection to buildings, though these
benefits are not likely to be achieved the first year after planting. Normally, trees are quite small
when they are planted, so some time is required before the full effect of the avoided emissions
can be realized. To account for this, a sliding scale was employed, such that trees planted in 2009
would achieve the full avoided GHG emissions benefit in 2025, and a linear phase-in of avoided
GHG benefits would occur each year. Avoided GHG benefits for trees planted in each year from
2009 to 2025 were thus calculated proportionally to their expected size in 2025, as shown in
Table J-7-4. Using this approach, it was assumed that the trees planted in 2009 would achieve
their full shade and wind protection potential (shown in Tables J-7-5a and J-7-5b) in 2025. It was
further assumed that any trees planted in 2010 or later would reach their full avoided GHG
emissions potential sometime after the conclusion of the policy implementation period.
The total avoided GHG benefits are a function of three different types of impacts: reduced
cooling demand, reduced demand for heating due to wind reduction, and increased demand for
heating due to wintertime shading. An average potential GHG reduction factor of 0.075
tCO2e/tree/year for trees in the Southeast region was calculated from data in McPherson and
Simpson. 110 The estimate assumed that the trees planted are split among residential settings with
pre-1950, 1950–1980, and post-1980 homes using McPherson's and Simpson's respective default
distributions for the Southeast of 28%, 54%, and 18%. This estimate further assumes a default
distribution of trees planted around buildings, based on measured data from existing urban
canopy in the region.

To calculate potential avoided GHG emissions due to increased shading, it was assumed that all
of the new trees are planted where they can have shading effects. Because these data were used
as potential maxima, large trees (half evergreen, half deciduous) planted and average tree
distribution around buildings were also assumed. Note that these fossil fuel reduction factors are
average for existing buildings, and do not necessarily assume that trees are optimally placed
around buildings to maximize energy efficiency. These factors are also dependent on the
electricity fuel mix (coal, hydroelectric, nuclear, etc.) in the regions of interest, and may thus
change if the mix changes. The average urban tree planted in Arkansas was assumed to result in
avoided emissions of 0.075 tCO2e/yr (Tables J-7-5a and J-7-5b).

The annual avoided GHG benefit of trees in each year of the policy implementation period was
calculated proportionally to the expected size of the trees in each age cohort in each year (Table
J-7-6). For each year between 2009 and 2025, this was calculated by multiplying the number of
trees planted in each preceding year by the maximum potential avoided GHG effect. This was
then multiplied by the scaling factor (Table J-7-4) that represents the proportion of the maximum
benefit achieved in a given year by trees planted in a prior year. For each year of policy
implementation, the shade- and wind-protection effects of trees planted in that year and each
prior year were summed to find the total avoided GHG impact of urban tree planting in that year
(Table J-7-6).

Urban Forestry Costs
The costs and cost savings of urban tree planting are calculated separately for the one-time cost
of tree purchase and planting; cost of annual maintenance (including pruning, removal and
disposal, pest and disease treatment, infrastructure repair, cleanup, liability and legal coverage);
and cost savings from avoided energy use. Data are available on the estimated economic benefits
of such services as provision of clean air, hydrologic benefits (e.g., stormwater control), and
aesthetic enhancement, but these indirect co-benefits are not included in this analysis.
State-specific data for Arkansas were not available for cost estimates, so data from the Piedmont
region, which includes states immediately to the south and east of Arkansas, were used. The
Piedmont Community Tree Guide reports that on average it costs $100 to purchase and plant an

J-64

urban tree. 111 The report also provides average annual maintenance costs and cost savings per
tree for four tree types; an average across these tree types was calculated and used for this cost
analysis (Table J-7-8) (see Appendices A1-A4 in the guide for the original data).

Costs and Cost Savings
Cost savings ($saved/year/tree):

Total Average Cost Savings
Maintenance costs
($spent/year/tree)

The number of trees planted each year was multiplied by a cost of $100/tree/yr to estimate initial
tree purchase and planting costs (Table J-7-9). Then, the total number of additional trees planted
to date (cumulative since the year planted) on existing urban areas was multiplied by
$5.26/tree/yr to estimate annual maintenance costs (Table J-7-9). The cost savings of
–$15.51/tree/yr was multiplied by the number of trees planted for energy efficiency to date
(cumulative since the year planted); this cost savings value was not adjusted for tree size.
Cumulative values are used for the latter two estimates because the maintenance costs and cost
savings occur in the year the tree is planted and each year thereafter.
Annual net costs are the sum of costs and cost savings. Annual net costs are discounted using a
5% discount rate. Net present value (NPV) is the sum of the annual net discounted costs and is
estimated to be $17 million. Cost-effectiveness is calculated by dividing the NPV by cumulative
GHG reductions for 2009–2025. Cost-effectiveness is estimated to be $41.49/tCO2e reduced.
Sustainable Management in Public and Private Lands: GHG Benefits
The above Policy Design section articulates a goal of 17% of publicly owned and 25% of
privately owned forests under sustainable management regimes by 2025. Assuming that federal
forestland is not under state jurisdiction, this suggests that a total of 3.69 million acres of private
forestland and 87,806 acres of state-owned resource lands would be managed in this way (Table
J-7-2). To achieve these cumulative levels, approximately 216,973 additional acres of privately
owned land and 5,165 additional acres of publicly owned land would be managed in this way
each year between 2009 and 2025.

1. Impacts of Improved Management on Carbon Sequestration

Net changes in carbon stocks in forest biomass and soil are influenced by growth, mortality, and
decay processes, and the amount of carbon removed during harvest, all of which are influenced
by forest management to some degree. A range of forest management activities can promote
productivity and increase the rate of carbon sequestration in Arkansas (see the Policy Description
section, above, for details). Increasing productivity involves increasing the rate at which forests
accumulate biomass—i.e., a high-productivity stand accumulates more carbon in biomass over
the same amount of time as an otherwise equivalent low-productivity stand. This leads to a
relatively higher growing-stock volume (i.e., the volume of living trees above the ground), some
portion of which is harvested at periodic intervals (providing for potentially greater harvest
volumes).
Data are available to estimate the carbon stock and growing-stock volume changes associated
with increasing productivity of loblolly-shortleaf pine stands in Arkansas. Loblolly-shortleaf
pine forests are the second most abundant type of forest in Arkansas, making up 29% of all
classes of forest (oak-hickory is the most abundant forest type, making up 39% of forest area). 112

Because the loblolly-pine forests are the most heavily managed forest type in Arkansas, an
analysis of this forest group alone is believed to be a good approximation of the overall potential
GHG benefits of forest management on privately owned forests in Arkansas. Publicly owned
state resource lands are more likely to be in hardwood or mixed forest types. However, since data
are not readily available to quantify the impact of a shift from low- to high-productivity stands in
these forest types, this analysis assumes that the effect of enhanced forest management on
publicly owned resource lands is consistent with the effect of enhanced management on privately
owned lands. Thus, the analysis below is indexed to shifting productivity levels from average or
below-average levels to high levels in loblolly-shortleaf stands, which results in roughly a
doubling of carbon sequestration in all forest types over a standard rotation.
The index was developed by comparing carbon and growing-stock volume yield tables for
average- and high-productivity loblolly-shortleaf pine stands in the South Central region
published by U.S. Forest Service (USFS). 113 This type of comparison assumes that the newly
treated stands will realize gains as if they were growing according to the yield table of a highproducing forest from their beginning. In reality, total gains will be influenced by the age of the
stand when treatment is initiated.
The net impact of a shift from low- to high-productivity forests involves both forest carbon and
harvested wood product (HWP) pools. From a carbon accounting perspective, harvested carbon
represents a carbon stock loss to the forest and a carbon stock gain into the HWP pool, with only
a portion of the carbon that is shifted into the HWP pool at harvest remaining stored for long
periods of time. The changes in carbon stocks in both forest and HWP pools are quantified
below.
2. Estimated Increases in Carbon Sequestration Rates and Growing-Stock Volumes

USFS publishes carbon stock tables for forest types by region for the entire country. In some
regions, for some forest types, USFS provides tables for both average- and high-productivity
stands. Such tables are available for loblolly-shortleaf pine in the South Central region. Carbon
stock and growing-stock volume data in the USFS tables (see Tables J-7-10 and J-7-11) were
used to calculate an annual carbon sequestration rate for average- and high-productivity loblollyshortleaf pine forests in Arkansas (carbon stocks in 30-year-old stands were subtracted from
carbon stocks in new stands and divided by 30). An average over 30 years is assumed to
encompass the range of age classes for this forest type, though in reality, sequestration rates vary
by stand age. Note that soil carbon stocks are constant over time and between productivity
classes, so carbon stock gains occur only in biomass pools. Comparing Tables J-7-10 and J-7-11
shows that high-productivity stands sequester approximately 0.79 metric tons more carbon per
acre per year. Therefore, regardless of the initial carbon stock levels, a forest stand that moves to
higher productivity status will gain roughly 0.79 more metric tons of carbon per acre per year
than it would if left as is.

In addition, the growing-stock volume is greater in all age classes of high-productivity stands.
Assuming that, on average, stands are harvested at 30 years, USFS HWP accounting methods
were used to convert the 3,409-cubic-feet-per-acre (cf/ac) incremental increase in growing-stock
volume into the equivalent carbon volume of 35.6 tC/ac. Note that this is the carbon stored in the
incremental increase in growing stock, only a portion of which is removed during harvest (this
analysis assumes 35% is removed, see below).
3. Calculation of Net Carbon Stock Change in Forests and HWP

The calculation of net forest carbon stock change takes into account each year gains in biomass
carbon stocks from higher accumulation rates are offset by the removal of larger volumes of
carbon during harvest (Table J-7-12). The incremental increase in biomass carbon stocks is
calculated by multiplying the cumulative number of acres treated by 0.79 tC/ac/yr (Table J-7-12,
Column A). Cumulative acres are used because once an area is treated, it continues to sequester
carbon at a higher rate in subsequent years.
The incremental increase in carbon removed during harvest is calculated by multiplying the
number of acres harvested each year by 35% of the carbon increase in growing-stock volume
(i.e., 35% of 35.6 tC/ac = 12.5 tC/ac) (Table J-7-12, Column B). This assumes that 35% of the
growing-stock volume is removed during a harvest (based on a study of carbon removals at
different harvest levels, 35% is roughly the proportion removed from moderate harvest

J-68

levels). 114 The number of acres harvested is calculated by assuming 4% of the acres treated each
year are harvested the following year. 115
Carbon removed during harvest is subtracted from the carbon gains in biomass due to
sequestration to yield a net change in forest carbon stocks each year (Table J-7-12, Column C). If
the calculation stopped here, this would imply that all carbon removed is essentially emitted to
the atmosphere. Therefore, a subsequent step is taken to account for the portion of carbon that
remains stored in HWP for a total carbon stock balance.
Standard USFS HWP accounting methods were used to estimate the incremental increase in
harvested carbon that remains stored in HWP indefinitely. The amount of carbon stored in HWP
carbon stocks is time-dependent relative to the year of harvest (carbon stocks are high initially
and decrease over time as a result of disposal and decay), making carbon stock accounting for
HWP complex. Therefore, an approach has been developed to standardize and simplify HWP
carbon accounting, which applies the amount of carbon still stored in HWP 100 years after
harvest as the estimated net increase in HWP carbon stocks; this gain is attributed to the year of
harvest.
The USFS methods from Smith et al. were applied to coefficients for loblolly-shortleaf pine
stands in the South Central region to estimate that approximately 22% of harvested carbon
remains stored in HWP 100 years after harvest.116 Therefore, the long-term storage of carbon in
HWP increases by approximately 2.7 tC/ac when stands go from average- to high-productivity
forests (i.e., an additional 12.45 tC/ac are harvested, of which 22% remains stored indefinitely).
The net carbon stock increase in HWP attributable to increased productivity was calculated by
multiplying the number of acres harvested by 2.7 tC/ac (Table J-7-12, Column D). For
standardization across all policy recommendations, units are converted to MMtCO2e in Table
J-7-13.

Restore/Establish Forest Cover: GHG Benefits
Due to intense competition for land among various uses, it is likely that afforestation and
reforestation will be most successful on lands where crop production is likely to fail. Land in the
Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley that is subject to spring and early summer backwater
flooding is ideal for forest establishment. It has been suggested that roughly 500,000 acres of this
land could be available for planting. 117 To achieve the goal of 500,000 acres by 2025, a linear
ramp to the goal level was assumed, such that 29,412 acres would be planted each year between
2009 and 2025.
Forests grown or planted on land not currently in forest cover will most likely accumulate carbon
at a rate consistent with the accumulation rates of average forests in the region. Therefore,
carbon sequestered by afforestation activities can be assumed to occur at the same rate as carbon
sequestration in average Arkansas forests. For this analysis, the forest type distribution used for
the Arkansas I&F was used: roughly 39% oak-hickory, 29% loblolly-shortleaf pine, 17% oakpine, and 15% oak-gym-cypress.
Average carbon storage was found using methods described in Smith et al., assuming that
afforestation activity would occur on forests that were consistent with the existing forest type

calculated by subtracting carbon stocks in new stands (0 years) from carbon stocks in 35-yearold stands and dividing by 35 years. A weighted statewide average carbon sequestration rate for
afforestation activity was calculated, taking into account the variation in carbon sequestration
across forest types (Table J-7-16). The 35-year period was chosen to reflect the average length of
an afforestation project period. In this afforestation calculation, soil carbon was assumed to
accumulate at a rate consistent with soil carbon accumulation in afforested stands in Smith et al.
The average rate of carbon accumulation on afforested land in Arkansas is roughly 3.6
tCO2e/ac/yr (Table J-7-16). This calculation of carbon sequestration under afforestation accounts
for carbon accumulation in below-ground and soil carbon pools.

Forests planted in one year will continue to store carbon in subsequent years. Therefore, the
GHG benefit of afforestation in one year is the cumulative impact of forests planted in prior
years. The overall GHG benefit of afforestation activity in Arkansas is described in Table J-7-17.

Restore/Establish Forest Cover: Economic Costs
Analyses of vegetation planting costs typically employ four categories: opportunity cost (of
planting forest rather than another, potentially more lucrative land use), conversion cost,
maintenance cost, and measuring/monitoring costs. 119 The opportunity cost for afforestation
activity was assumed to be $51.82/ac/yr, which was the annual average rental payment to
farmers in Arkansas with land enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program as of 2007. 120 Onetime costs of vegetation establishment include site preparation and vegetation planting, and vary
with planting method (hand planting or machine planting) and forest type (hardwood or
softwood). 121 For afforestation in Arkansas, the average cost of planting softwoods is $141/acre

and the average planting cost for hardwoods is $183/acre (Table J-7-18). Since planting will
occur on both hardwood and softwood forest types, a weighted average for planting was
computed for afforestation at $170.82/acre. Maintenance and monitoring costs on afforested land
were assumed to be negligible between 2009 and 2025.

Discounted costs to 2025 were calculated using a 5% discount rate. Results, including annual
costs, are summarized in Table J-7-19. The NPV of this recommendation, expressed in 2009
dollars, is roughly $201 million, and the overall cost of implementing this recommendation was
calculated to be $12.44/tCO2e stored.
Key Assumptions:
The Smith et al. NE-GTR-343 methodologies for carbon sequestration were adopted for
afforestation. 122 These methodologies account for below-ground carbon storage (i.e., in all dead
organic matter pools, including forest floor and soil organic matter). However, the reforestation
methodologies assume that there is no change in soil carbon pools.

Key Uncertainties
The quantification assumes that there is no enhanced soil carbon storage under improved forest
management practices. However, soil carbon storage may be increased with improved forest
management practices.
While ongoing forestry management costs, such as planting costs, may increase over time, costs
are assumed to remain constant in real terms across the period.

Appropriate species selection and placement of trees can provide additional benefits through
continuity of wildlife habitat, wetland buffer and protection, and adaptation to climate change.

AFW-8. Advanced Recovery and Recycling

Policy Description
Increasing waste recovery and recycling and reducing waste generation limit GHG emissions
associated with landfill methane generation and with the production of raw materials. Additional
actions include increasing existing recycling programs, creating new recycling programs,
providing incentives for recycling construction materials, developing markets for recycled
materials, and increasing average participation/recovery rates for all existing recycling programs.
Policy Design
Goals: Increase the recycling rate for “GHG significant solid waste streams” by 2% every
5 years where geographically cost-effective.
Timing: Continuing on from the statutory recycling goal of 45% by 2010:
! The 2015 goal would be a 2% improvement on the 2010 actual recycling rate;
!

The 2020 goal would be a 2% improvement on the 2015 actual recycling rate; and

!

The 2025 goal would be a 2% improvement on the 2020 actual recycling rate.

Parties Involved: Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ), Regional Solid
Waste Management District, waste collection providers, and recycling industry.
Other: To measure the GHG impacts of municipal solid waste (MSW), the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) first decided which wastes to analyze. The universe of materials and
products found in MSW was surveyed, and those that are most likely to have the greatest impact
on GHGs were identified. These determinations were based on (1) the quantity generated, (2) the
differences in energy use for manufacturing a product from virgin versus recycled inputs, and (3)
the potential contribution of materials to CH4 generation in landfills. By this process, EPA
limited the analysis to the following 21 single-material items:
!

Three categories of metal: aluminum cans, steel cans, and copper wire;

!

Glass;

!

Three types of plastic: HDPE (high-density polyethylene); LDPE (low-density polyethylene);
and PET (polyethylene terephthalate);

!

Six categories of paper products: corrugated cardboard, magazines/third-class mail,
newspaper, office paper, phonebooks, and textbooks;

!

Two types of wood products: dimensional lumber and medium-density fiberboard;

!

Food discards;

!

Yard trimmings;

!

Clay bricks;

J-78

!

Concrete;

!

Fly ash; and

!

Tires.

EPA’s researchers also included two products that are composites of several materials: carpet
and personal computers.
The goals in this policy represent a linear extrapolation of Arkansas’ state recycling goals set
forth by Act 94 (HB 1055). Data for 2006 document an overall solid waste recycling rate of
42%. (See Table J-8-1 for waste steams and tons recycled.) It is not known how many tons of
these waste streams were disposed in Arkansas landfills, as there is no reporting requirement for
these data.
To increase the diversion of recycled materials from the solid waste disposal stream for those
waste identified as having the biggest global warming impacts, several factors need to be
considered:
!

Economics—Arkansas disposal rates at MSW landfills are some of the lowest in the nation.
Communities, businesses, and industries have no incentives to collect and divert recyclable
materials from waste streams directed to landfills.

!

Curbside Programs Enhanced—Currently 97 communities have curbside recycling
programs. Some 190 communities offer recycling opportunities at drop-off centers. Programs
need to be encouraged to expand the number of items collected and to offer residents
incentives to reduce waste destined for the landfills. Pay-As-You-Throw rewards residents
for reuse and recycling by charging lower solid waste disposal rates.

!

Pre-Consumer Recycling—Arkansas industries should be offered more incentives to reduce
waste destined to MSW landfills.

!

Commercial Recycling—Less than 10% of Arkansas municipalities offer local businesses the
opportunity to reduce the amount of waste deposited in landfills. Incentives need to be
developed at the local level to encourage participation in recycling programs.

!

End User—The development of state or regional end users should be encouraged. Long-haul
transportation costs to end users affect profit margins, and profits are how recycling
programs exist. Arkansas offers the 30% State Income Tax Credit for collection and use of
recyclable materials in the manufacturing process.

Implementation Mechanisms
Examples of potential implementation mechanisms that could help achieve the policy goals
through encouraging advanced recycling and recovery include:
!

Strengthening existing recycling legislation or providing incentives/subsidies to the
municipalities to have more aggressive recycling efforts (currently it is more expensive to
recycle than to landfill).

!

Encouraging reuse and recycling through best management practices for corporations,
businesses, and government organizations.

!

Introducing container deposit legislation (bottle bill) that requires that a deposit on beverage
packaging material (glass, plastic, and/or aluminum containers124 ) be collected when the item
is sold. The deposit is then refunded to the consumer when the container is returned to an
authorized redemption center.

!

Encouraging centralized recycling locations, perhaps through corporation-based locations—
e.g., supermarket chains could have recycling centers.

!

Encouraging the procurement of products produced from recycled material.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Recycling Goals
Act 94 (HB 1055)—The act adds a new goal to the year 2000 recycling goals for Arkansas, which
is to recycle 40% of the MSW by the end of 2005 and 45% of the MSW by the end of 2010. The
act also defines MSW.
Solid Waste Management and Recycling Fund
Act 1325 (SB 575)—This act permits grants from the Solid Waste Management and Recycling
Fund to be used for the cost of “recycling programs.” Previous law permitted grants to be used
for “recycling programs and market development.”
Opportunity to Recycle
Arkansas Code Annotated 8-6-720(a)(1)—Beginning July 1, 1992, each regional solid waste
management board must ensure that its residents have an "opportunity to recycle," which means
the availability of curbside pickup or collection centers for recyclable materials at sites that are
convenient for people to use.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Reductions in Upstream Energy Use—The energy and GHG intensity of manufacturing a
product are generally less when using recycled, rather than virgin, feedstocks.
CH4: Diverting biodegradable wastes from landfills decreases methane gas releases from
landfills.

Quantification Methods:
GHG Benefits
The GHG benefits resulting from increased waste diversion in Arkansas are quantified by:
!

Establishing BAU projections for landfill disposal, incineration, recycling, and composting.
(As recycling and composting are fundamentally two different processes, they will be
considered separately, with the sum of the two being equal to total waste “diversion.)

!

Using the goals set forth by the TWG to project the policy scenario for waste management.

!

Using recycling data from the ADEQ State of Recycling in Arkansas reports and nationallevel generation and disposal data from the EPA 2006 Municipal Solid Waste
Characterization Data Tables, and disaggregating the Arkansas recycling, composting, and
disposal data.

!

Inserting the resulting waste characterization for the baseline and policy scenarios into
WARM to determine the incremental GHG benefit resulting from the goals set forth in this
policy. WARM provides a life-cycle estimate of the GHG benefits from additional recycling
and composting. These benefits include the energy required to produce materials from virgin
inputs and to recycle materials, and the change in landfill gas emissions.

The baseline recycling and composting rates for MSW in Arkansas are 40.3% and 1.8%,
respectively. Based on the change in MSW generation over the last 5 years, it is assumed that the
BAU average annual increase in MSW generation is 4.7%. Population projections are consistent

J-82

with those used in the development of the Arkansas I&F. 125 These assumptions are used to
develop the BAU waste management scenario presented in Table J-8-2.

the disaggregated recycling information provided in the 2002–2006 State of Recycling in
Arkansas annual reports and the inputs available for the WARM. Table J-8-5 shows the waste
generation characteristics of broad waste categories, and Table J-8-6 shows the mix of generation
by specific waste type within some of these categories. Again, these tables present an estimated
waste characterization for Arkansas, based on national generation and diversion rates that are
assumed to adequately represent the Arkansas waste stream. Due to cases where a larger quantity
of a given material was recycled than projected to be generated under the BAU scenario,
adjustments to the raw national data were made to fit the Arkansas waste profile.
The mix of waste generation shown in Tables J-8-5 and J-8-6 is applied to the total waste
generation in Arkansas. Next, the shares of waste recycled and composted (Table J-8-7) within
each of these categories are multiplied by the total amount of waste recycled (or composted for
food waste, yard trimmings, and mixed organics), to yield the amount of waste recycled or
composted by waste type.
Once the tonnages of waste generated, recycled, and composted are established, the recycled and
composted wastes are subtracted from the amount generated, leaving the amount of waste that
has not been diverted. This amount is the assumed quantity of waste landfilled by waste type.
The results of this process are entered into WARM. Tables J-8-8 and J-8-9 display WARM
inputs for 2025.

Due to insufficient data on the characterization of waste landfilled in Arkansas, CCS was required to project the
BAU and policy scenarios using a default national waste characterization from EPA. The adjustments and
aggregation of material types required to fit the data to the WARM reduce the certainty of the GHG benefit
estimates. As a consequence, the results in Table J-8-9 do not directly correlate with ADEQ data in Table J-8-1.

J-88

WARM = [EPA’s] WAste Reduction Model; HDPE = high-density polyethylene; LDPE = low-density polyethylene;
PET = polyethylene terephthalate; MSW = municipal solid waste.

The WARM analysis predicts a GHG benefit of 1.5 MMtCO2e in 2015 and 4.4 MMtCO2e in
2025. Assuming the program implementation begins in 2010 and a linear increase in emission
reductions between target years, the cumulative GHG benefit is estimated to be 36 MMtCO2e
through 2025 (Table J-8-10).

Cost-Effectiveness
Recycling—The net cost of increased recycling rates in Arkansas was estimated by adding the
increased costs of collection for two-stream recycling, revenue obtained for the value of recycled
materials, and avoided landfill tipping fees. The additional cost for separate curbside collection
of recyclables is $2.50/household/month, or $30/household/year. 128 Dividing this number by the
incremental recycling per capita in 2025, 129 and multiplying that number by the average

128

T. Brownell, Eureka Recycling, personal communication with S. Roe (Center for Climate Strategies), December
17, 2007. This value compares favorably with data provided to the AFW TWG (T. Troolin, St. Louis County) on
recycling costs incurred by Minnesota counties.

household size of 2.49, 130 yields the maximum collection cost of $6.73/ton. The capital cost of
additional recycling facilities in Arkansas is $134 million.131 Annualized over the 15-year policy
period at 5% interest, the capital cost is $8.7 million/year. The avoided cost for landfill tipping is
$28/ton. 132 The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) also factored in the commodity value of
recycled materials with a value of $38/ton. 133 Table J-8-11 provides the results of the cost
analysis. The analysis assumes that costs begin to be incurred in 2010. The estimated cost
savings result in an NPV of –$295 million. Cumulative reductions are 17.0 MMtCO2e, and the
estimated cost-effectiveness is –$17/tCO2e.

Composting—Composting is included in the total recycling volume in the State of Recycling in
Arkansas reports. However, as WARM considers the sole form of diversion for yard trimmings
and food waste to be composting, the tons of these items that are “recycled” are assumed to be
composted. The net costs for increased composting in Arkansas were estimated by adding the
additional costs for collection (same calculation as recycling) and the net cost for composting
operations. The net cost for composting operations is the sum of the annualized capital and
operating costs of composting, increased collection fees, revenue generated through the sale of
compost, and the avoided tipping fees for landfilling. Information on the capital and operating
costs of composting facilities was received from Cassella Waste Management during the analysis
of a similar policy in Vermont. 134 These data are summarized in Table J-8-12.

134

P. Calabrese (Cassella Waste Management), personal communication with S. Roe (Center for Climate Strategies)
on June 5, 2007. Because the cost was not originally specified in terms of 2007$, the TWG assumed the cost to be
valid for 2005.

CCS assumed that the composting facilities to be built within the policy period would tend to be
from the largest category (achieving the most efficient operating costs) shown in Table J-8-12.
The composting volumes in 2015 and 2025 shown in Table J-8-13 suggest the need for one
additional large composting operation to meet the incremental increase in composting through
2025. To annualize the capital costs of these facilities, CCS assumed a 15-year operating life and
a 5% interest rate. Other cost assumptions include an assumed landfill tipping fee of $28/ton,135
an additional source-separated organics collection fee of $2.50/household (or $51/ton, as used
above in the recycling element), a compost facility tipping fee of $30/ton, 136 and a compost value
of $25/ton. 137
Table J-8-13 presents the results of the cost analysis for composting. GHG reductions were
assumed not to begin until 2010, and the cumulative reductions estimated were 0.06 MMtCO2e.
An NPV of $12 million was estimated, along with a cost-effectiveness of $182/tCO2e.

Key Assumptions: For the MSW management input data to WARM, the key assumption is that
none of the goals would be achieved via existing programs in place. To the extent that those
programs will fully or partly achieve the goals of this policy, the GHG reductions estimated
would be lower (no additional penetration from the current Arkansas recycling and composting
campaigns has been incorporated into the BAU assumptions for this analysis). Therefore, the
most important assumption relates to the assumed BAU projection for solid waste management.
This BAU forecast is based on current practices, and does not factor in the effects of further
gains in recycling or composting rates during the policy period. The BAU assumptions are
needed to tie into the assumptions used to develop the GHG forecast for the waste management
sector, which does not factor in these changes in waste management practices during the policy
period (2010–2025). To the extent that these gains in recycling and composting would occur
without this policy, the benefits and costs are overstated.

J-94

The other key assumptions relate to the use of WARM in estimating life-cycle GHG benefits and
the use of the stated assumptions regarding costs for increased source reduction, recycling, and
organics recovery (composting in this example) programs.
Another important assumption is that under BAU, the waste directed to landfilling would include
methane recovery (75% collection efficiency) and utilization. The need for this assumption is
partly based on limitations of WARM (which doesn’t allow for management of landfilled waste
into both controlled and uncontrolled landfills), but is also based on the overall direction of the
policy recommendations of AFW-8.
Additionally, transportation emissions for WARM are taken as default. This analysis has not
considered the impacts of reduced exports as a result of the goals in this recommendation’s
Policy Design section.
This analysis assumes that no additional uncontrolled landfill sites trigger EPA control
requirements during the policy period.
Key Uncertainties
One factor of uncertainty with the analysis, as performed above, is the interest rate used for
capital expenditures. Table J-8-15 displays the effect on the results of this policy
recommendation that 8% and 10% interest rates would have on the results, which are based on a
5% interest rate.

Currently, the amount of clay bricks, concrete, fly ash, or carpet disposed in Arkansas is not
tracked by ADEQ. Bricks and concrete go to class four landfills in a mixture of materials. At this
time, fly ash and carpet can be very costly to transport to disposal sites, and the markets for these
materials are not very strong. Although these materials are a discernable part of the waste stream
in Arkansas, resources could be concentrated on them in the future in order to better understand
both current and potential disposal strategies.
It is possible that the impacts of this goal will cross state lines. Recycled materials in Arkansas
may be reprocessed into finished products in other states. Also, the recycled materials may be
replacing virgin inputs that are mined, processed, and manufactured into finished goods outside
of Arkansas’ boarders. Thus, the practice of increased recycling in Arkansas may create benefits
outside of the state’s boundary.

J-95

Due to insufficient data on the characterization of waste landfilled in Arkansas, CCS was
required to project the BAU and policy scenarios using a default national waste characterization
from EPA. The adjustments and aggregation of material types required to fit the data to the
WARM model reduce the certainty of the GHG benefit estimates.

AFW-9. End-of-Use Waste Management Practices

Policy Description
These programs use the renewable energy created at landfills by anaerobic digesters (methane) to
make electric power, space heat, or liquefied natural gas. New processes for converting waste
energy include biomass gasification and pyrolysis. A range of renewable products can be
developed from these processes, including gaseous and liquid fuels, biochar, and chemical
products. Existing processes include waste combustion and energy recovery (as electricity,
steam, or both).
Policy Design
Goals: By 2025, 25% of all landfills develop landfill gas-to-energy (LFGTE) and anaerobic
digester projects.
Timing: As indicated above.
Parties Involved: Landfill owners, ADEQ, and energy industries.
Other: There are currently 24 municipal solid waste landfills operating in Arkansas. Of those, 6
have an active gas collection system, 4 of the 6 are or will be flaring landfill gases, and 2 are
collecting and using these gases for energy.
Based on the baseline data from the Arkansas I&F, the 2005 GHG emissions averted through
flaring or LFGTE projects is 12% of the total CH4 emissions from MSW generation.
Implementation Mechanisms
All landfills could be required to examine the current costs and value of collecting and/or
utilizing landfill gas, to ensure that owners and operators are aware of current costs (which are
decreasing, possibly making collecting and/or utilizing landfill gas more feasible or economical
than some are aware).
Incentives in the form of payments to utilities, industries, individuals, or other entities that utilize
energy from landfill sites could be provided to encourage recipients to locate their operations
close enough to existing landfill sites so that they can use the methane and/or electricity
generated from those facilities.
Cost incentives, such as carbon credits, could make methane capture and/or utilization more
attractive. State tax incentives/tax credits may encourage utilization of landfill gas

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Reduction of fossil fuels and associated GHGs through the generation of electricity from
landfill methane or heat/steam or electricity at waste-to-energy facilities.
CH4: Diverting biodegradable wastes from landfills will decrease methane gas releases from
landfills.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2015, 2025 (MMtCO2e): 0.02, 0.02, respectively.

Quantification Methods:
GHG Benefits
The goal of this policy recommendation requires 25% of all landfills in Arkansas to utilize
LFGTE technology by 2025. According to ADEQ, there are currently 24 landfills in Arkansas.
Thus, LFGTE technology will have to be installed at six landfills in order to meet the goal.
Currently, two landfills already utilize LFGTE technology, and four others have installed active
gas collection systems, flaring the collected gas. 138 It was assumed that these four landfills that
already have an active gas collection system will be the most cost-efficient landfills to target for
LFGTE.

and those with currently installed gas collection systems. Sent by K. Bassett (ADEQ) to B. Strode (Center for
Climate Strategies) on July 9, 2008.

J-98

The potential GHG benefit from the installation of LFGTE technologies at landfills comes from
two sources: the conversion of the methane in landfill gas to CO2 (a gas with a lower global
warming potential) and the indirect benefit from the offset electricity or natural gas use. Since
CCS assumed that the four additional landfills installing LFGTE needed to meet the goal will be
those that already have active gas collection systems, only the indirect benefit of offset fossil
energy use will be considered incremental to the BAU scenario.
CCS used the EPA LFGcost model to estimate the amount of electricity that could be generated
in each year by the four additional landfills installing LFGTE. 139 Based on 2007 waste
generation rates, 140 the LFGcost model predicted that 46,160 MWh could be generated at the
landfills with new LFGTE equipment. Using the same emission factor for offset electricity as the
ES TWG used in its analysis of recommendation ES-3a (Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard),
it was estimated that the fulfillment of the goal for AFW-9 would produce a GHG benefit of 0.02
MMtCO2e in 2025, with a cumulative benefit of 0.4 MMtCO2e for the policy period 2010–2025.
Cost-Effectiveness
The cost-effectiveness of this recommendation was determined using the LFGcost model. 141 The
current model inputs assume an 8% interest rate over 15 years for capital and an electricity price
of $0.045/kWh. The LFGcost model predicts the total capital expense and average annual O&M
costs. 142 The sum of the annualized capital and O&M costs, less revenue generated from the sale
of electricity, yields the net cost of this policy recommendation. The NPV of this
recommendation was estimated to be –$1.1 million, with a cost-effectiveness of –$3/tCO2e (see
Table J-9-1).
Key Assumptions:
The modeling that produced the above results was based on the assumption that the landfills that
would implement LFGTE were those that already utilize active gas collection. However, as this
analysis was not intended to be prescriptive, it should be noted that the AFW TWG did not
specify which landfills should implement LFGTE to meet the goals of this recommendation.

It is assumed that the most likely candidates to use LFGTE are the sites that are currently
required by regulation to have an active gas collection system. Environmental regulation could

J-100

push other sites into required active collection in the future, either by air rules or solid waste
rules. EPA has four federally recognized modeling protocols for predicting air emissions that, in
turn, determine who has to have active control and by what year. Those models could change and
cause more facilities to become affected. Another possibility also exists that any of the 24
landfills currently in operation could end up “hot” with gas, to the point where solid waste rules
could push them into active collection. There is no way to predict this, because the geology and
historic construction of each site are unique. If a site were required to control gas through
collection within the site’s regular business activities, then it is likely that the site owners would
at least consider the possibility of utilizing that gas through either selling the gas or generating
energy as a way to offset costs.
LFG collection can be expensive. Methane utilization can also be expensive and can take the site
to a new level of complexities. For example, electricity generation is a different industry and
requires a different from that required by waste management industry different from the waste
management industry. Also, the quantification of this recommendation does not account for the
costs that may arise from the added complexity of LFG collection and utilization.
It is possible that landfill sites not considered in the quantification of this recommendation may
trigger EPA requirements during the policy period. However, for the purposes of the
quantification of AFW-9, this is assumed not to occur.
Additional Benefits and Costs
None identified.
Feasibility Issues
The collection of methane at landfill gas sites can be expensive. Additionally, the utilization of
methane can increase both expenses and the level of complexity—electricity generation is a
different industry and requires a different from the waste management industry different from
that required by the waste management industry. The expenses associated with installing capture
and utilization technology may affect the feasibility of implementing this recommendation in the
absence of alternative financial mechanisms (e.g., carbon credits).
The opportunities to utilize the methane and/or electricity at the waste generation site could be
limited. The relocation of industries to utilize the energy from landfill sites or the transportation
of energy from the landfill site to industry could present additional barriers to implementation.

Appendix L
Public Comments
This appendix is a compilation of the comments that members of the public provided during the
public comment period at each of the meetings of the Governor’s Commission on Global
Warming (GCGW). The GCGW started its deliberative process for developing its policy
recommendations for mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at its third meeting. The
commenters appear in the order in which they spoke at the meetings.
GCGW Meeting #3, February 7, 2008
Dr. Joe Bates (Deputy Director of Health of the Arkansas Department of Health), spoke as an
individual, not representing the collective views of the Department of Health. He expressed his
concerns about emissions from coal-fired electricity generation plants in the state. Death rates
from lung cancer, stroke, and heart disease are higher in areas where these plants are located, and
mercury disseminated into the atmosphere, to the ground, to the water, and to the fish we eat can
lead to brain damage. Young children cannot achieve their full intellectual capacity, because
their mothers’ breast milk is contaminated. Although Arkansas is a small player in the global
scheme, it can do much more to improve its environment and the health of its citizens.
GCGW Meeting #4, February 28, 2008
There were no comments from members of the public.
GCGW Meeting #5, April 9, 2008
Jim Shirrell, (FTN Associates, Ltd.), was pleased to note that the Agriculture, Forestry, and
Waste Management (AFW) Technical Work Group (TWG) is considering including the
beneficial use of landfill methane gas in its policy options. He suggested that the Residential,
Commercial, and Industrial (RCI) TWG also consider adding landfill methane gas to its RCI-1
renewable energy option.
GCGW Meeting #6, May 19, 2008
Venita McClellan-Allen (President and Chief Executive Officer of Southwestern Electric Power
Company [SWEPCO]), presented a case for supporting the new Hempstead coal plant recently
approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC). Recognizing the need to balance
the goals of environmental protection and affordable electricity, she contended that rejecting the
state's abundant coal resources would significantly raise the cost of electricity to consumers and
would be harmful to the state's economy. She proposed that Arkansas adopt a portfolio of
options that includes advanced coal technology, renewable energy, demand-side management,
new nuclear plants, and new transmission and distribution (T&D) infrastructure. The Hempstead
plant will contain the most energy-efficient technology available, including ultra-supercritical
technology.
Leah Arnold (American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity) commented that coal is a major
factor in keeping the price of electricity affordable. Farmers making less than $50,000 spend
22% of their after-tax income on electricity, and people making less than $10,000 a year spend
L-1

50% of their after-tax income on electricity. She contended that an advanced ultra-supercritical
coal-fired power plant will be an important factor in achieving the goal of emission-free
electricity generation.
Kenny Henderson (Assistant General Counsel, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.) said using natural gas
for electricity generation is a cost-effective approach to reducing GHG emissions. He contended
that increasing the use of natural gas for space and water heating can offset the need for new
power plants. A Black & Vetch study has found that emissions from natural gas-fueled space and
water heaters produce 40% less carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than do space and water heaters
powered by electricity generated from fossil fuels, when considering emissions from the power
plant. The industry believes that establishing a goal for direct use of natural gas will provide
benefits to all consumers.
Glen Schwarz (Little Rock Environmental Action) believes a carbon tax on gasoline is a simple
solution to global warming. The United States has the lowest gasoline tax of all oil-importing
nations. The highest GHG-producing fuels—fossil fuels, such as diesel and coal—could be taxed
the highest; followed by a mid-level tax on less polluting fuels, such as natural gas; and perhaps
no tax on very low-GHG-emitting fuels. The United States must prepare for a world without oil.
The tax money could be used toward smart growth, mass transit, and other GHG-reducing
initiatives.
Glen Hooks (Sierra Club) commended the GCGW on its work. He noted the Sierra Club's
concern about coal-fired power plants and its support for carbon sequestration recommended
under policy option ES-7, citing the technology's potential to trap pollutants and prevent them
from entering the air and water.
Van Warren (WOV, formerly of the National Aeronautic and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory) believes the state's "addiction to dirty coal" is not serving Arkansans
well. He supports the GCGW's recommendations for wind, photovoltaic, and solar cell
technologies. He added that natural gas could be used as a transition fuel, solar concentrators are
being overlooked, and the potential for biodiesel fuel technologies is untapped. He pointed to the
need to educate Arkansas students on climate forces and issues, and suggested that the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock's Energy Institute could provide support toward this effort.
Eddy Moore (Arkansas Public Policy Panel) also commended the GCGW on its work,
particularly regarding the feed-in tariff recommended under policy option RCI-2, which places
Arkansas in a leadership position by taking this initiative. However, he noted that energy
efficiency experts recommend a 6% per year reduction in natural gas use, rather than the 1%
target under RCI-2. Also, he believes the target addresses only a small part of the problem, and
recommended broadening its focus to include reductions in total sales.
William Ball (Arkansas Renewable Energy Office) recommended that Arkansas adopt a feed-in
tariff for electricity use. As opposed to net metering, a feed-in tariff would enable the state to pay
farmers above-market rates. The more electricity consumed, the more it would cost. The revenue
generated could help the state finance its energy efficiency targets.

L-2

Doug Barton (Arkansas Coalition for Peace and Justice) expressed the urgency of the need to
address global warming, and recommended that Arkansas aggressively increase its energy
efficiency through improvements in building design and increased use of renewable energy
technologies. He noted that while a healthy economy is dependent on a healthy environment, the
reverse doesn't apply. He concluded that if the world continues to burn fossil fuels at the current
rates, we won't have a world to worry about the economy.
GCGW Meeting #7, June 17, 2008
Sammie Cox (Manager, Governmental Affairs, American Electric Power–Southwestern Electric
Power Company [SWEPCO]) is opposed to placing a "moratorium on SWEPCO building the
Turk plant until carbon capture and storage technology is available." He believes, that if
implemented, such a policy will "harm Arkansas' ratepayers and economy, and ignores the
eventuality of a national cap-and-trade program, which will enable our [SWEPCO's] companies
to reduce CO2 [carbon dioxide] emissions in the most cost-effective manner." He recommended
that the GCGW focus instead on promoting incentives for development of renewable energy
technologies, encouraging energy efficiency and demand-side management (DSM), and
providing tax incentives for developing clean-coal technologies.
Mr. Cox also is opposed to taxing utilities based on the carbon content of their fuels and
restricting their ability to recover these costs. He noted that a carbon tax at the state level will
place additional burdens on ratepayers, "harm economic development, and place Arkansas at a
competitive disadvantage when recruiting new business and industry."
Ron Bank (retired building contractor) expressed his doubt about the predicted environmental
catastrophes resulting from climate change. He then said that the LEED certification requirement
has overstated benefits and understated costs and restricts trade. He added that 90% of a
building's costs are related to design, and 90% of Arkansas building contractors don't have LEED
certification. He asked why LEED needs to be mandated if it makes economic sense, adding that
overregulation may produce unintended consequences. He concluded that if LEED truly
produces cost savings, contractors will become certified voluntarily.
Matthew Petty (Co-Chair, Carbon Caps Task Force) noted the GCGW is tasked with
recommending policies for reducing total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. He urged the
commissioners look to science as a guide to their work; to "require all energy production
proposals to include a reasonably up-to-date and comprehensive economic and environmental
analysis of alternatives to new plant construction, such as infrastructure development or
expansion of efficiency programs"; and to "prevent those results from being redacted from
rulings by" the Arkansas Public Service Commission (APSC). Finally, he requested that the
GCGW make strong recommendations to the Governor "to ensure the APSC acts in Arkansas'
best interests and only endorses the best solutions," and to place a "permanent moratorium on
[building new] unsequestered coal" plants.
Mike Callen (President, Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Corporation) observed that using natural gas
for electricity generation is cost-effective and can reduce peak requirements. Using natural gas
for energy results in 90% efficiency, compared to 27% efficiency from using other fossil fuels.
The gas utilities don't agree with the statement in the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial
RCI-2 (Utility and Non-Utility DSM for Electricity and Natural Gas) policy description that says
L-3

that because of the decline in sales to consumers that natural gas utilities have experienced over
the last 10 years, it is not necessary to impose a state goal for utilizing DSM programs to reduce
consumption of natural gas. He added that RCI-5 (Education for Consumers, Industry Trades,
and Professions) should include education for consumers on the benefits of natural gas.
William Ball (Chairman of the Arkansas Renewable Energy Association and President of Natural
Environments, Inc.) made the following observations: "(1) there are too many options and there
is overlap between policies of the different TWGs, (2) just one or two good policies that will
make it through the legislature and survive the interpretation of the APSC will be better than a
slue of weaker ideas, and (3) mandates may produce less desirable results than incentives and
goals with "teeth"…. [W]hat started as a 1.3 billion-dollar budget to build a coal-fired power
plant would cover the cost of installing enough PV [photovoltaic energy] in Arkansas, and do so
at a time of day and year that is semi-coincident with peak demand." He added that improving
building shells and mechanical equipment can require less than half the energy the average
building requires.
Michelle Kitchens (Associate Director, National Affairs, Arkansas Farm Bureau) expressed the
Farm Bureau's strong support of the renewable fuels industry. She pointed out that renewable
fuels have a small effect on the rising price of food, and that the bigger challenge food markets
face is the grain losses in the Midwest as a result of the recent widespread floods. She observed
that the increasing use of cellulosic ethanol could be limiting gas prices. Without expansion of
renewable fuels, world food prices would be even higher than today. More research and
development needs to be devoted to developing alternative sources of energy. Arkansas has
tremendous potential for developing biodiesel and cellulosic ethanol fuels, and should also
increase carbon sequestration and conservation easements.
Ken Smith (State Director, Audobon Arkansas) stated that we know for a fact that GHGs are
rising. Worldwide temperature increases are having profound effects on species, particularly
birds. History has proven that environmental restrictions, such as those imposed by the Clean Air
and Clean Water Acts and the Superfund program, have not harmed the economy. Audobon
Arkansas supports recommendations for national and regional cap-and-trade programs, a carbon
tax, and energy efficiency programs.
GCGW Meeting #8, June 31, 2008
Ludwik J. Kozlowski, Jr. (Arkansas Community Action Agencies Association) pointed to the
need to expand the federal Weatherization Assistance Program to provide funding for no-cost
green loans to low-income households to heat their homes.
Ken Smith (Audobon Arkansas) commented that each of the four planned power plants will cost
$1.5–$2 billion, and together they will contribute 32% of the carbon emitted in the state. He
recommended investing in energy conservation, energy efficiency, and renewable energy as
aggressively as possible before constructing the new plants. He also commended the seven
utilities that are participating in APSC's energy efficiency programs, and recommended that they
be rewarded with perhaps performance-based incentives. He concluded, however, that these
energy efficiency initiatives may not be sufficient to meet the state's future energy demand, and
suggested that the GCGW consider providing a source of revenue to fund a reinvigorated
Arkansas Energy Office to make the necessary energy efficiency improvements.
L-4

Bill Lord (Program Director, Northwest Arkansas Regional Solid Waste Management District,
and President, Arkansas Association of Regional Solid Waste Management Districts) suggested
that the GCGW look into providing carbon credits to assist landfills with collecting methane. He
also recommended providing incentives to companies to convert high energy-consuming diesel
solid waste collection vehicles to energy-efficient vehicles that run on biofuels. He believes that
Arkansas can substantially improve its recycling rates, noting that more than 60% of all solid
waste generated can be recycled or composted. He recommended the state pass container deposit
legislation, noting that some states with "bottle bills" are recycling 70%–95% of all plastic, glass,
and aluminum containers. Increased recycling of containers would create many green jobs in
Arkansas, save landfill space, provide a giant step toward recycling goals, and significantly
reduce GHG emissions and use of electricity, oil, and gasoline.
Reagan Sutterfield (business consultant and farmer) suggested that the GCGW look at the
positive and negative economic development impacts and macroeconomic effects of the four
planned coal plants. He pointed to the state's brain drain of younger people who are leaving the
state for technology centers, and suspects the plants won't cause them to stay in or return to
Arkansas.
Danny Traylor informed the GCGW that 100 stakeholders in the Anthracite Coal Company are
developing the Scranton Coal Company close to Morrison Bluff and Scranton. He said that semianthracite coal is a good candidate for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
technology. The economics appear promising for dusting off the old River Mountain
hydroelectric project and developing an underground gasification facility. The critical enabling
technology is CO2 storage. Arkansas is blessed with good opportunities for enhanced natural gas
recovery, sitting at the top of natural gas-producing reservoirs and coal seams (enhanced coalbed
methane). Deep-well injection has the potential to sequester 3–6 million tCO2/year. He suggested
that the GCGW look at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology study The Future of Coal
(http://web.mit.edu/coal/The_Future_of_Coal.pdf). The stakeholders are going to try to develop
a 21st-century project on a scale that hasn't been achieved. All the infrastructure is in place in the
Arkansas River Valley.
Andrew Endicott (Social Sustenance Organization) supports four items for addressing global
warming that could create thousands of green jobs and reduce GHG emissions: (1) demand-side
management can align the interests of utilities and the environment with energy-efficient devices
and appliances; (2) stricter building codes for new construction can reduce the energy use of and
CO2 emissions from future buildings; (3) implementation of commercial-scale renewable energy
feed-in tariffs can reduce risk and increase returns on investment in renewable energy; and (4) a
carbon capture and storage requirement in the state can preclude future investment in dirty coal
toward renewable energy and environmentally friendly energy options. He concluded that
avoiding the catastrophic impacts of climate change will require tremendous investment and
work.

Randy Eminger (American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity)
In 2001, average Arkansans spent 11% of their income on energy costs; in 2008, that figure rose
to 19%. About 123,000 families in Arkansas are living below the poverty level, and spend 34%
of their income on energy costs. While there may be a global warming trend, that trend is not
evident in Arkansas.
J.D. Harper (Arkansas Manufactured Housing Association)
The GCGW should amend RCI-1 to acknowledge ongoing efforts by the manufactured housing
industry to enhance the energy efficiency of manufactured homes.
Tommy Foltz (Arkansas Biofuels Alliance)
The GCGW should support the production of cellulosic biofuels. AFW-5 precludes firstgeneration biofuel technology. Arkansas should simultaneously be using the technology that's
available today while working toward advanced biofuels. Foltz offered to share with the GCGW
the language that he is recommending be added to AFW-5.
Nathan Pittman (Arkansas Soy Energy Group)
The GCGW should expand the program for strengthening the Arkansas biodiesel industry
because biodiesel burns clean and significantly reduces GHG emissions, local biodiesel
feedstocks are abundant, biodiesel is cost competitive compared to fossil fuels, and the state has
several existing biodiesel producers. Non-food feedstock should be evaluated as they become
available.
Eddy Moore (Arkansas Public Policy Panel)
Under the Energy Supply policy options, the GCGW should account for some range of carbon
pricing. Power companies have considered carbon pricing in modeling future opportunities, and
private-sector markets and public service commissions take it into account as well.
J.P. Bell (Physician, Fort Smith, Arkansas)
Arkansas' air is becoming dirtier primarily due to emissions from coal-fired power plants. The
GCGW should recommend that the state put a moratorium on building new capacity for coalgenerated power plants, whose emissions are impairing the health of Arkansans.
Gladys Tiffany (Omni Center for Peace, Justice & Ecology and Clean Air Arkansas Coalition)
The GCGW should limit coal-fired electricity generation as much as possible.
Shelly Buonaeuto (Omni Center for Peace, Justice & Ecology and Clean Air Arkansas Coalition)
Arkansans should limit the energy they use. The GCGW should recommend that the state
provide tax credits to citizens who install solar, wind, and other renewable energy technology.

L-6

Michael Buonaeuto (Omni Center for Peace, Justice & Ecology and Clean Air Arkansas
Coalition)
The GCGW should limit coal-fired electricity generation as much as possible.
Joe Bender (Clean Air Arkansas Coalition)
A 600-MW coal plant will result in significant emissions of CO2, SO2, particulate matter, and
mercury, threatening health and ecosystems. Arkansans need to use energy more efficiently, and
the electrical grid needs to be decentralized. RCI-7 is a significant step toward reducing the
state's emissions and boosting its economy.
Amos (Little Rock)
Northeastern and northwestern Arkansas have good wind resources. Potential producers of wind
energy in the state are poised to start production as soon as Arkansas enacts legislation that offers
producers of renewable energy financial incentives similar to those that other states offer.
Robert Huston (Clean Air Arkansas Coalition)
Building a coal-fired plant will have significant negative impacts on Arkansas' environment and
economy.
Jack Sundale (Citizen)
There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal already accounts for a major share of Arkansas' GHG
emissions. The state should place a higher tax on coal-fired electricity to discourage its use, and
should encourage energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy.
Joe Sundale (Citizen)
The GCGW should recommend that the state make coal-fired electricity production the most
expensive form of electricity to purchase, while maximizing economic incentives to citizens who
install solar power and to local governments that provide the best available public transportation.
GCGW Meeting #10, September 25, 2008
Sammie Cox (AEP–Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO))
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should be built. The Arkansas Public Service Commission
has approved the ultra-supercritical plant, which will be one of the most efficient coal plants in
North America and will be retrofitted for carbon capture and storage technology when it
becomes available.
David "Bubba" Powers (Arkansas House of Representatives)
The majority of citizens of Hempstead County support construction of the Turk plant and are
confident that SWEPCO will be a good steward of the environment.
Jim Kirchhoff (Hope Water and Light Corp.)
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should be built. SWEPCO has been a long-time provider of
low-cost power and energy for Arkansans. Replacing coal with natural gas-fired electrical
generation will significantly increase the cost of electricity.

L-7

Wes Woodward (Hempstead County Economic Development Corporation)
Portions of southwestern Arkansas have experienced surges in energy costs caused by
replacement of coal with natural gas-fired electrical generation, which have significantly hurt
businesses in the area. Arkansas' demand for electricity will continue to grow. Arkansas needs to
rely on a broad range of reliable, cost-efficient energy resources to maintain and grow its
economy.
Matthew Petty (Omni Center for Peace, Justice & Ecology /Social Sustenance Organization)
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should not be built. With the implementation of a tax on
carbon, energy efficiency measures will be far more cost effective than electricity production
from fossil fuels, will create permanent jobs in the state, and will reduce GHG emissions.
Kelly Mulhollan (Citizen)
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should not be built. It's folly to be working to reduce global
warming and at the same time allow more coal plants to be built.
Larry Brown (Citizen)
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should not be built. Geothermal energy should be
considered as an alternative source of energy. Arkansas has some hot areas that show promise.
Smaller units could be built close to substations.
Malcolm Cleaveland (Professor Emeritus, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville)
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should not be built. There's substantial evidence that global
warming is occurring, and catastrophic changes are inevitable. (See written comments below.)
James Burke (Ecological Conservation Organization)
Mr. Burke read a quote from Al Gore stating why the Turk (Hempstead County) plant should not
be built.
Joanna Pollock (Omni Center for Peace, Justice & Ecology)
Building the Turk (Hempstead County) plant will harm Arkansas' ecology, and the costs will far
exceed the benefits. The state should invest in renewable energy, which will protect the
environment and create lasting employment for Arkansans.
Barbara Horn (Arkansas State Senate)
Southwestern Arkansas residents support building the Turk (Hempstead County) plant.
Eddy Moore (Arkansas Public Policy Panel)
The Turk (Hempstead County) plant should not be built. The Arkansas Public Policy Panel hired
an independent expert who found that the cheapest source of energy in the state will be natural
gas-fired generation and energy efficiency measures.
Steve Copley (The Interfaith Alliance of Arkansas)
In its recommendations to the Governor, the GCGW should keep in mind the value of creation
and the need and responsibility to protect the planet.

To the Governor's Commission:
I wish to discuss some reasonably complex concepts and apologize for expression of my
frustration when limited to two minutes in the public comment session. I will try to to be succinct
here.
I would like to inject some urgency into what some seem to see as just an attempt to put a useless
restraint on industry. Unfortunately, the issues are much more serious than that. Today the
scientific evidence is clear, despite a well-funded disinformation program that would do credit to
the CIA. Global warming is occurring, and humans are responsible.
But some will say, "We have hundreds of years to solve this problem and why should we make
any effort now, when there is still at least some scientific uncertainty about our vulnerability and
we are still developing key technologies to mitigate the problem?"
Wrong! We may not have much time and we could see catastrophic changes in the lifetimes of
many people on the Commission. The paleo-climatic record shows that step changes in climate
may occur in decades, perhaps even years in some cases.
How could this happen? Changes are often:
1. Nonlinear-some are exponential functions, like rabbit populations when there are no predators.
2. The result of positive feedbacks in the climate system. What is a positive feedback? Think of
an explosion that starts with a spark but quickly escalates. An example of a positive feedback is
warming of the Arctic tundra, which releases large quantities of frozen methane. Methane itself
is a potent greenhouse gas, and as methane concentrations increase, temperature will increase,
releasing more methane in a vicious cycle.
3. Threshold effects or tipping points. Past a certain points, positive feedbacks take over and
catastrophic change becomes inevitable. We could be very close to a threshold for revolutionary
climate changes.
What are possible consequences? How severe could they be? An example is the deglaciation of
the polar regions. Deglaciation is proceeding at a phenomenal rate and it appears to be
accelerating. The Greenland ice cap is shrinking; if it were to go completely, sea level would rise
at least 20 feet, submerging trillions of dollars of infrastructure and displacing hundreds of
millions of people. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is also losing mass and could easily
L-9

become destabilized. That would raise sea levels 10 to 20 feet. In addition to the huge human
costs, critical coastal ecosystems would be destroyed.
Other impacts of global warming are already being felt widely. For example, the ongoing loss of
mountain glaciers and snowpacks that provide water supplies and hydroelectric power to over a
billion people and the extension of fire seasons, resulting in catastrophic fires.
Are we sure that bad things will happen if we continue business as usual? Bad things are already
happening, but we cannot say with complete certainty that catastrophic changes will follow, and
will follow quickly. Do we want to gamble with huge chunks of our civilization? If change will
be catastrophic, prudent people make those preparations necessary to avoid that outcome.
Ask the Chinese - they gambled that a big earthquake would not occur during school, so they did
not quakeproof their schools in a known high risk seismic zone. The results? More than 10,000
children dead and many more injured and psychologically traumatized.
We are in a known climate change hazard zone. In the face of uncertainty, but with horrific
consequences for inaction, prudent people act. Reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is critical.
We should at least take "no regrets" actions toward that goal, such as increasing economic
efficiency. It is my understanding that new coal fired power is much more expensive than
conservation efforts to reduce demand. And improvement of the national transmission grid
would move existing excess power where it is needed.
In a way it is unfair that Arkansas should have to undertake to limit GHGs without leadership
from the Federal level. Unfortunately, there has been no semblance of guidance from the feds, so
the states have been taking the lead. It is time that Arkansas joined them and showed a little
leadership of our own.
