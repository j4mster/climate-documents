Executive Summary
This Scoping Plan Update establishes a proposed framework of action for California to
meet the most aggressive climate target in North America: a 40 percent reduction in
greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. This goal builds on California’s
success in establishing effective policies that are reducing emissions of greenhouse
gases while delivering substantial economic and environmental benefits. Further, the
goal aligns California with the rest of the world in the global effort to fight climate
change. The Proposed Plan is designed to continue to shift the California economy
away from dependence on fossil fuels to a thriving sustainable future that delivers
continued economic growth, job generation, and a wide range of environmental benefits
to all California communities through the coming decade and beyond.

At the signing ceremony for
SB 32 Governor Edmund G.
Brown noted that the 2030
target will “keep California on
the move to clean up the
environment, to encourage
vast innovation and to make
sure we have the
environmental resilience that
... Californians really want
and expect.”

This document marks the second chapter to
California’s groundbreaking efforts to fight climate
change. The first Scoping Plan was required by
Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), The Global Warming
Solutions Act, and adopted in 2008. Under that plan,
California set in place a range of effective programs to
slash greenhouse gases from cars, trucks, fuels,
industry and electrical generation, and the State is well
on its way to achieving the goal of AB 32 – to reach
1990 levels of greenhouse gases by 2020.
The Proposed Plan builds on those programs, and
takes aim at the 2030 target established by Senate Bill
32 (SB 32) (Pavley). That bill, and related laws, is
designed specifically to continue California’s leadership
in the fight against climate change and guide the State
toward an equitable clean energy economy and

prosperous future.
To reach that future, this Proposed Plan draws on the successes and the lessons
learned from the first chapter of California’s efforts to fight climate change under AB 32.
It proposes continuing the major programs that have been a hallmark of our success,
and the approach that has served as a model for other states and jurisdictions around
the nation and world. The key programs that the Proposed Plan builds on include the
Cap-and-Trade Regulation, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and much cleaner cars,
trucks and freight movement, powering our State off of cleaner renewable energy, and
strategies to reduce methane emissions from agricultural and other wastes by using it to
meet our energy needs. It also comprehensively addresses for the first time the
greenhouse gas emissions from natural and working lands of California – including the
agriculture and forestry sectors.
The Proposed Plan was developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB or
Board) staff working alongside multiple agencies and departments within the
ES1

Administration. This effort was guided by, and fully addresses, direction provided by the
Legislature and includes public comment from 15 Scoping Plan workshops statewide,
and the input of the Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (EJAC) and many
stakeholders.
By combating climate change at the level outlined in this plan, California joins the global
effort to address the one overarching issue of our time that ties together all the strands
of our energy and environmental policies – the escalating crisis of global climate
change. The evidence for climate change is irrefutable and the scientific record today is
even more definitive than when AB 32 was passed. The buildup of greenhouse gases
released over many decades by the combustion of fossil fuels in our power plants and
factories, and to move our people and goods, combined with the loss of carbon that was
once stored in forests and natural lands, is creating an irreversible change in the earth’s
atmosphere, leading to an all-too familiar array of problems including from forest fires,
coastal erosion, disruption of water supply, spread of insect-borne diseases and
intractable urban air pollution.
And while climate change is without doubt a global phenomenon, its effects are felt
close to home, and California is already experiencing its impact. A recent State report
noted the following observed changes in California, harbingers of further shifts that, if
left unchecked, will disrupt the economy and impact public health and air quality.






Annual average temperatures in the State are on the rise, including increases in
daily minimum and maximum temperatures.
Extreme events, including wildfire and heat waves, are more frequent.
Spring runoff volumes are declining as a result of a diminished snowpack.
The number of “winter chill hours” – crucial for the production of high-value fruit
and nut crops – are declining.
Species are on the move, showing up at different times and locations than
previously recorded, including both flora and fauna at higher elevations.

Those findings make an even more persuasive case for California’s vulnerability to
climate change and the need to us to take action – as well as partner with others at an
even faster rate – to stave off the most severe impacts of climate change. This was the
reason why SB 32, the new law extends the State’s climate actions beyond 2020, was
passed and signed.
SB 32 fully recognizes those impacts and drew on global scientific research and
consensus among experts that a 40 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 is
necessary to put California on the path to contain the rise in global temperatures to
below 2 degrees Celsius, to prevent the worst-case scenarios of rising temperatures.
The approaches to reach the goal outlined in this document require choices that can
forestall those impacts, while also making our communities and economy more resilient
– and more equitable at the same time.

ES2

It achieves that goal by ensuring, as did AB 32, that environmental justice and equity is
an integral and irreducible priority of the plan overall, and is considered and addressed
in each of its component programs.
To ensure the Proposed Plan acknowledges and addressed the issue of equity, CARB
worked extensively with the EJAC during the development of the Proposed Plan. This
work included extending the Scoping Plan development timeline to hold a series of
meetings in environmental justice communities throughout the State with presentations
and participation from both State agency representatives and members of the EJAC.
Members of the EJAC also presented at workshops they held with support from CARB
throughout the development of the proposed Scoping Plan.
The EJAC presented a series of recommendations based on these meetings and in
response to public materials provided by the State. As a result CARB added, for
example, a scenario with a so-called cap-and-tax program, in addition to the other
alternative scenarios: no cap-and-trade but rather relying exclusively of prescriptive
regulations; a carbon tax; and ‘all’ cap-and-trade. In response to AB 197 and
environmental justice community concerns, the Proposed Plan includes a measure for
prescriptive regulations for refineries that would reduce greenhouse gases potentially
along with harmful criteria and toxic air pollutants.
Achieving the 2030 target under the Proposed Plan will also spur the transformation of
the California economy and fix its course securely on achieving an 80 percent reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, consistent with the global consensus of the scale
of reductions needed to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations at
450 parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent, and reduce the likelihood of
catastrophic climate change. Currently, global levels are at just above 400 parts per
million.
This approach is consistent with additional efforts by California to move in concert with
the global community. As one example, the creation of the Under 2 Memorandum of
Understanding brought together states, provinces, and nations around the world
committed to limiting their greenhouse gas emissions to less than 2 metric tons per
capita by 2050. To date, 165 jurisdictions representing over 1 billion people and 35
percent of the global economy have signed on, providing a powerful signal of the
world’s intent to address climate change.
But, reducing greenhouse gases is only one part of the equation for California. As we
build our clean energy future, we must also ensure that our efforts to fight climate
change continue to meet clean air standards and benefit community and ecosystem
resilience. Achieving these intertwined goals requires a multi-pronged strategy that also
delivers reductions in criteria and toxic pollution especially in disadvantaged
communities that are disproportionately burdened by the impacts of pollution. In
addition to regulatory measures, investment in communities through the Affordable
Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, the Transformational Climate
Communities Program, Low Carbon Transportation Program and the Transit and
ES3

Intercity Rail Capital Program, result in reduced pollution, increased jobs and improved
conditions in communities throughout California that are the most impacted.
Investments in forests and farms and in the waste sector help sequester carbon on the
State’s valuable landscapes.
An additional challenge in a successful climate program is to control greenhouse gas
emissions while also supporting economic growth. To date, California has reduced
greenhouse gas emissions by about 10 percent from our historic highs in the early
2000s, and the State’s economy has demonstrated continued growth at a rate above
the national average. And, year over year, the amount of carbon ‘embedded’ in the
Gross State Product (GSP), expressed in the number of tons of carbon dioxide per
million dollars of GSP, has dropped. This means the economy is experiencing greater
fiscal growth for each unit of energy expended; in short – more economic growth with
less carbon.
The State’s experience to date strongly suggests that continuing with the successful
programs currently in place – strengthening the programs with additional elements – is
the right course to take to continue on the road of growth and declining carbon intensity
of the economy.
With this in mind, and drawing on the input of stakeholders and the EJAC while
following the direction of the Legislature, the major elements of the framework proposed
in this document are as follows:
1. SB 350
 Achieve 50 percent Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) by 2030.
 Doubling of energy efficiency savings by 2030.
2. Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)
 Increased stringency (reducing carbon intensity 18 percent by 2030, up from
10 percent in 2020).
3. Mobile Source Strategy (Cleaner Technology and Fuels Scenario)
 Maintaining existing GHG standards for light- and heavy-duty vehicles.
 Put 4.2 million zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) on the roads.
 Increase ZEV buses, delivery and other trucks.
4. Sustainable Freight Action Plan
 Improve freight system efficiency.
 Maximize use of near-zero emission vehicles and equipment powered by
renewable energy.
 Deploy over 100,000 zero-emission trucks and equipment by 2030.
5. Short-Lived Climate Pollutant (SLCP) Reduction Strategy
 Reduce emissions of methane and hydrofluorocarbons 40 percent below
2013 levels by 2030.
 Reduce emissions of black carbon 50 percent below 2013 levels by 2030.
6. SB 375 Sustainable Communities Strategies
 Increased stringency of 2035 targets.
ES4

7. Post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program
 Declining caps, continued linkage with Québec, and linkage to Ontario,
Canada.
 CARB will look for opportunities to strengthen the program to support more air
quality co-benefits, including specific program design elements. In Fall 2016,
ARB staff described potential future amendments including reducing the
offset usage limit, redesigning the allocation strategy to reduce free allocation
to support increased technology and energy investment at covered entities
and reducing allocation if the covered entity increases criteria or toxics
emissions over some baseline.
8. 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the refinery sector.
9. By 2018, develop Integrated Natural and Working Lands Action Plan to secure
California’s land base as a net carbon sink.
This proposed approach is structured to address policy requirements and criteria while
providing the widest range of environmental and economic benefits.
On the economic front, the Proposed Plan presents significant opportunities for
employment and growth for California investors, business, and households. As we
have seen in the past decade, an increase in clean technology employment, and growth
in service industries and sectors providing health care and education, will replace
sectors heavily dependent on fossil fuels. In 2030, Californians will spend less money
on cars and utility bills and increase spending on cleaner fuels, recreation, and public
transportation. Overall, under the Proposed Plan the California economy is anticipated
to grow to $3.4 trillion, roughly one-half percent less growth by that date when
compared to a scenario where we did nothing at all.
In return, the State will continue to grow in the direction of a more balanced clean
energy economy. The investments made in implementing the Proposed Plan will
present significant opportunities for California investors and businesses; upfront capital
investments will result in long-term fuel and energy efficiency savings, the benefits of
which will continue far into the future.
We are already seeing these benefits. In 2015 California received 68% ($9.8 billion) of
total US clean tech company investment ($14.5 billion), continuing California’s first
place finish over the past decade. These investments translate directly into jobs with
321,000 workers in energy efficiency jobs statewide, including 72,000 within Los
Angeles County. Seventy percent of energy efficiency establishments in the State are
small businesses.
The success stories are notable. As a whole, advanced energy enterprises employ
over half a million workers in California – three times the combined total of motion
pictures, television, and radio – bigger than agriculture, forestry, and fishing. And, the
pace is quickening. In 2015, the advanced energy sector generated jobs at six times
the rate of the State’s economy overall.

ES5

The evidence of the transformation of California’s economy is everywhere. It is
impossible not to notice the number of houses with money-saving solar arrays, or the
utility-scale solar and wind turbine installations throughout the State. They have
become commonplace, and now ultra-clean transportation is rapidly becoming another
California hallmark.
There are already more than one-quarter million electric vehicles in California – almost
half the national total and clean transportation is fast becoming a significant part of the
State’s clean energy economy. In 2015, clean transportation was the hottest sector for
venture capital investment in California, bringing in $3.4 billion in that year, 90.5 percent
of all clean transportation vehicle capital investment in the nation. In the coming months
and years, more and more zero-emission and hybrid trucks and buses will be on the
State’s streets and highways, including many destined for disadvantage communities.
Under the Proposed Plan, these ultra-clean vehicles and a wide range of other climate
investments in and for these communities will continue to come from an established
program, structure and mechanism that is distributing revenues from the Cap-and-Trade
Program to disadvantaged communities.
California Climate Investments from Cap-and-Trade auction proceeds are being
strategically invested to further the goals of California’s climate legislation by reducing
GHG emissions and providing benefits to disadvantaged communities. To date, over $3
billion has been appropriated from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, with
approximately one third of the funding targeted to benefit disadvantaged communities.
The goal of this multi-billion dollar effort is to ensure the equitable transformation of the
economy with a focus on investments to improve the environment and clean the air in
the neighborhoods, communities and systems throughout the state that need them the
most. Projects range from affordable housing close to transit, urban forestry projects,
support for ultra-clean car purchases by low-income families, electric car-sharing
programs, electric and hybrid buses for transit agencies, to solar roofs in disadvantaged
communities to help slash energy costs for families who qualify.
There are other benefits of the Proposed Plan. The uncertainty in both forecast
emissions and performance estimates of other measures means the Cap-and-Trade
Program in the Proposed Plan, thanks to the declining cap, serves as a backstop and is
able to ‘scale’ up to ensure that the 2030 target is met. By incorporating a refinery
measure – which will likely also reduce criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants –
and advancing other measures, the Proposed Plan also prioritizes rules and regulations
for direct emissions reductions at large stationary, mobile, and other sources.
The Proposed Plan protects against emissions leakage by allowing for a specified
amount of free allocation of Cap-and-Trade Program allowances, where supported by
research. It also supports the ability to link with other states and provinces, and develop
further reductions through collaborative regional efforts.

ES6

A Comprehensive Approach
Working to propel the world’s fifth largest economy to a clean energy future entails
enacting policies at multiple governmental levels and across multiple agencies and
organizations. The Proposed Plan draws much of its ability to respond to changing
circumstances from the underlying network of crosscutting statewide programs that
address GHG reductions through a comprehensive approach to broad, related
economic activities or sectors.
For example, the Sustainable Freight Strategy achieves reductions through both
increased efficiency and the transition to zero-emission equipment to move goods from
production to your doorstep. The Mobile Source Strategy is designed to modernize and
upgrade transportation infrastructure, enhance system-wide efficiency and mobility
options, and promote clean economic growth in the mobile sector. The SB 375
Sustainable Communities Strategies and regional Climate Action Plans support safer
streets, more walking and biking, improved transit options, more efficient land use and
more vibrant communities. All three will deliver significant reductions in greenhouse
gases and cut both smog-forming and toxic pollution.
The Proposed Plan sits at the center of this broad tapestry of California’s other climateoriented plans and strategies. These include, for example, the California Transportation
Plan 2040, the State’s Forest Carbon Plan, the State Wildlife Action Plan and the
California Water Action Plan. These are designed to focus on reducing carbon pollution
while also delivering targeted results and a broad range of co-benefits.
Conclusion
The Proposed Plan continues more than a half-century of California’s nation-leading
efforts to clean our air and water, and improve the environment. But, climate change
poses a challenge of unprecedented proportions that will impact all Californians whether
they are city dwellers in Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, farmers in Salinas or
the Central Valley, or the millions of Californians who live in the Sierra, the northern
counties, or in the desert areas.
In this Proposed Plan, every sector in our thriving economy plays a crucial role. Cities
and local governments are already rising to the challenge, and will play increasingly
important roles with programs ranging from low-carbon and cleaner transit, to more
walkable streets and the development of vibrant urban communities.
We will see a remarkable transformation of how we move throughout the State, away
from cars that burn fossil fuels to cleaner, electric cars that will eventually even drive
themselves. Freight will be moved around the State by trucks that are vastly cleaner
than those on the road now, with our ports moving towards zero- and near-zero
emissions technologies. The heavily travelled Los Angeles-San Francisco corridor will
be serviced by comfortable, clean and affordable high speed rail.

ES7

These efforts will slash pollution now created from making and using gasoline and
diesel fuel statewide. The greatest benefits of this shift away from fossil fuels will be in
the disadvantaged communities of our State, which are so often located adjacent to
ports, rail yards, freight distribution centers and freeways. And, thanks to the continued
investment of auction proceeds from the Cap-and-Trade Program in these same
communities, we can continue to work on bringing the benefits of clean technology –
whether electric cars or solar roofs or other technologies – to those in our State who
need them the most.
We will see enhanced efforts in our natural and working landscapes, ranging from
efforts to restore forests to a natural condition that sequesters carbon, improves water
quality, and protects residents from catastrophic wild fire, to converting waste to
compost for application on the land base, to ensuring that wetlands can sequester
carbon and clean our water.
In every sense possible, the Proposed Plan belongs to all Californians, and in one way
or another, we will all have a role to play over the coming decades in making it work.
Climate change presents us with unprecedented challenges – challenges that cannot be
met with traditional ways of thinking or conventional solutions. As Governor Brown has
declared, meeting these challenges will require “courage, creativity and boldness.”
Over the last decade we proved to ourselves, and the world, that Californians recognize
the danger of climate change and are willing to take action to address it head on. We
have also seen over the past decade that by being bold and creative, we can all benefit
from the transition to clean energy with cleaner air, less carbon pollution and continued
economic growth and job generation.
This Proposed Plan builds on those early steps and moves California into a new chapter
that will deliver a thriving and more resilient economy and a clean environment to our
children and grandchildren. It is a commitment to the future, but it begins today.

Introduction
A.

Background

In November 2016, California Governor Edmund G. Brown affirmed California’s role in
the United States, noting, “We will protect the precious rights of our people and continue
to confront the existential threat of our time—devastating climate change.” By working
to reduce the threat facing the State and setting an example for other jurisdictions that
aim to take action, California continues to lead in the climate arena. The Proposed
Strategy for Achieving California’s 2030 Greenhouse Gas Target (Proposed Plan)
identifies how the State can build upon its legacy of climate leadership, reach our 2030
climate goals, and substantially advance toward our 2050 climate goals. By selecting
and pursuing a sustainable and clean economy path for 2030, the State will continue to
successfully execute existing programs, demonstrate the coupling of economic growth
and environmental progress, and enhance new opportunities for engagement within the
State to address and prepare for climate change.
This Proposed Plan builds on and integrates efforts already underway to reduce the
State’s greenhouse gas (GHG), criteria, and toxics emissions. Programs such as the
Low Carbon Fuel Standard and Renewables Portfolio Standard are delivering cleaner
fuels and energy, the Advanced Clean Cars Program has put more than a quarter
million clean vehicles on the road, and the Sustainable Freight Action Plan will result in
efficient and cleaner systems to move goods throughout the State. Enhancing and
implementing these ongoing efforts puts California on the path to achieving the 2030
target. This Proposed Plan relies on these, and other, foundational programs paired
with an extended more stringent Cap-and-Trade Program and new refinery regulations
to deliver GHG, air quality, and other benefits.

Climate Legislation and Directives

California has made progress on addressing climate change during periods of both
Republican and Democratic national administrations and Democratic and Republican
State administrations. California governors and legislatures have taken bold steps to
ensure the State’s leadership, and commitment to improving public health and the
environment are always a priority. A series of executive orders and laws generated
policies and actions across State government, among local and regional governments,
and within industry. These policies also encouraged collaboration with federal agencies
and spurred partnerships with many jurisdictions beyond California’s borders. The
State has been consistent and bold in its efforts to address climate change and serve as
an example of how other regions can take similar action in reducing GHG emissions.
Moving forward, California will continue its pursuit of collaborations and advocacy for
action to address climate change.

1

Assembly Bill 32: California’s Global Warming Solutions Act
Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Nuñez,
Chapter 488, Statutes of 2006), represented a defining moment in California’s long
history of environmental stewardship and secured the State’s role as a leader in
reducing GHGs. In response to AB 32, California began to address climate change by
employing a comprehensive, long-term approach to cut the State’s GHG emissions to
1990 levels by 2020 and to maintain and continue reductions post 2020.
Pursuant to AB 32, the Scoping Plan must “identify and make recommendations on
direct emission reduction measures, alternative compliance mechanisms, market-based
compliance mechanisms, and potential monetary and nonmonetary incentives” in order
to achieve the 2020 goal, and achieve “the maximum technologically feasible and costeffective GHG emission reductions” by 2020 and maintain and continue reductions
beyond 2020.
Executive Order B-30-15
In his January 2015 inaugural address, Governor Brown identified five key climate
change strategy “pillars,” which recognize that several major areas of the California
economy will need to reduce their emissions to meet California’s ambitious climate
change goals. These five pillars are:
1. Reducing today’s petroleum use in cars and trucks by up to 50 percent;
2. Increasing from one-third to 50 percent our electricity derived from renewable
sources;
3. Doubling the efficiency savings achieved at existing buildings and making
heating fuels cleaner;
4. Reducing the release of methane, black carbon, and other short-lived climate
pollutants; and
5. Managing farm and rangelands, forests, and wetlands so they can store carbon.
Consistent with these goals, Governor Brown signed Executive Order B-30-15 in April
2015, establishing a California GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levels by
2030. Executive Order B-30-15 also calls on the California Air Resources Board (CARB
or Board), in coordination with sister agencies, to update the AB 32 Climate Change
Scoping Plan to incorporate the 2030 target. Executive Order B-30-15 also builds out
the “sixth pillar” of the Governor’s strategy—to safeguard California in the face of a
changing climate—highlighting the need to prioritize actions to reduce GHG emissions
and build resilience in the face of a changing climate.
Senate Bill 350: Golden State Standards
Senate Bill 350 (SB 350) (De Leon, Chapter 547, Statutes of 2015), Golden State
Standards, requires the State to set GHG reduction planning targets both for the
electricity sector as a whole and for individual utilities and other electricity providers
2

(collectively known as load serving entities), which will develop strategies to reduce
GHG emissions through Integrated Resource Planning. The bill also codified an
increase in the Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) to 50 percent by 20301 and
doubling of energy savings in electricity and natural gas end uses as discussed in the
Governor’s inaugural address. By enacting these two complimentary targets into law,
SB 350 aims to create jobs, grow the State’s economy, and improve public health by
setting new renewable energy standards for California’s RPS and increasing energy
efficiency, and by focusing long-term resource planning on reducing GHG emissions.2
Senate Bill 32: California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2016: emissions limit and
Assembly Bill 197: State Air Resources Board: greenhouse gases: regulations.
In summer 2016 the Legislature passed, and the Governor signed, Senate Bill 32
(SB 32) (Pavley, Chapter 249, Statutes of 2016) and Assembly Bill 197 (AB 197)
(Garcia, Chapter 250, Statutes of 2016). SB 32 affirms the importance of addressing
climate change by codifying into statute the GHG emissions reductions target of at least
40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 contained in Governor Brown’s April 2015
Executive Order B-30-15. SB 32 builds on AB 32 and keeps us on the path toward
achieving the State’s 2050 objective of reducing emissions to 80 percent below 1990
levels, consistent with an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) analysis
of the emissions trajectory that would stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations at 450
parts per million carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and reduce the likelihood of
catastrophic impacts from climate change.
The companion bill to SB 32, AB 197, provides additional direction to CARB on the
following areas related to the adoption of strategies to reduce GHG emissions.
Additional direction in AB 197 meant to provide easier public access to air emissions
data that are collected by CARB was posted in December 2016:3




It requires annual posting of GHG, criteria, and toxic air contaminant data
throughout the State, organized by local and sub-county level for stationary
sources and by at least a county level for mobile sources. Separate from the
development of the Proposed Plan, CARB has begun the process to implement
this provision of AB 197.
When adopting rules and regulations to achieve emissions reductions to protect
the State’s most affected and disadvantaged communities, CARB shall consider
the social costs of the emissions of GHGs, and prioritize both of the following:
o Emission reduction rules and regulations that result in direct emission
reductions at large stationary sources of GHG emissions and direct
emission reductions from mobile sources.
o Emission reduction rules and regulations that result in direct emission
reductions from sources other than those listed above.

In the development of each scoping plan, AB 197 also directs CARB to identify
for each emissions reduction measure, including each alternative compliance
mechanism, a market-based compliance mechanism, and potential monetary
and nonmonetary incentives the following information:
o The range of projected GHG emissions reductions that result from the
measure.
o The range of projected air pollution reductions that result from the
measure.
o The cost-effectiveness, including avoided social costs, of the measure.

Senate Bill 1383: Short-lived climate pollutants: methane emissions: dairy and livestock:
organic waste: landfills.
Senate Bill 1383 (SB 1383) (Lara, Chapter 395, Statutes of 2016) requires the
development, adoption, and implementation of a Short-Lived Climate Pollutant
Strategy.4,5 Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), such as black carbon, fluorinated
gases, and methane, are powerful climate forcers that have a dramatic and detrimental
effect on air quality, public health, and climate change. These pollutants create a
warming influence on the climate that is many times more potent than that of carbon
dioxide. The State has issued a Proposed Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction
Strategy (Proposed SLCP Strategy), which establishes a path to decrease GHG
emissions and displace fossil-based natural gas use. This includes deploying widely
available technologies to avoid landfill methane emissions by reducing the disposal of
organics, recovering methane from wastewater treatment facilities, and manure
methane at dairies, and using the methane as a renewable source of natural gas to fuel
vehicles or generate electricity. The Proposed SLCP Strategy also identifies steps to
reduce natural gas leaks from oil and gas wells, pipelines, valves, and pumps to
improve safety, avoid energy losses, and reduce methane emissions associated with
natural gas use. SB 1383 includes the following specific goals for 2030 from 2013
levels:




40 percent reduction in methane,
40 percent reduction in hydrofluorocarbon gases, and
50 percent reduction in anthropogenic black carbon.6

CARB released a revised Proposed SLCP Strategy in late November 2016 that reflects
the direction in SB 1383.
Assembly Bill 1504: Forest resources: carbon sequestration.
AB 1504 requires the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to adopt district forest
practice rules and regulations in accordance with specified policies to, among other
things, assure the continuous growing and harvesting of commercial forest tree species.

The bill also requires the Board of Forestry and Fire Protection to ensure that its rules
and regulations that govern the harvesting of commercial forest tree species consider
the capacity of forest resources to sequester carbon dioxide emissions sufficient to
meet or exceed the sequestration target of 5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMTCO2e)/year net annually, as established in the first AB 32 Climate
Change Scoping Plan.
Senate Bill 1386: Resource conservation, natural and working lands.
SB 1386 (Wolk, Chapter 545, Statutes of 2016) declares it the policy of the State that
protection and management of natural and working lands, as defined, is an important
strategy in meeting the State’s GHG reduction goals. In addition, State agencies must
consider protection and management of natural and working lands in establishing
policies and grant criteria, and in making expenditures, and “implement this requirement
in conjunction with the State’s other strategies to meet its greenhouse gas emissions
reduction goals.”

Initial Scoping Plan and First Update to the Scoping Plan

The Initial Scoping Plan7 in 2008 presented the first economy-wide approach to
reducing emissions and highlighted the value of combining both carbon pricing with
other complementary programs to meet California’s 2020 GHG emissions cap while
ensuring progress in all sectors. The coordinated set of policies in the Initial Scoping
Plan employed strategies tailored to specific needs, including market-based compliance
mechanisms, performance standards, technology requirements, and voluntary
reductions. The Initial Scoping Plan also described a conceptual design for a cap-andtrade program that included eventual linkage to other cap-and-trade programs to form a
larger regional trading program.
AB 32 requires CARB to update the scoping plan at least every five years. The First
Update to the Scoping Plan8 (First Update), approved in 2014, presented an update on
the program and its progress toward meeting the 2020 limit. It also developed the first
vision for the long-term progress that the State endeavors to achieve. In doing so, the
First Update laid the groundwork to transition to the post-2020 goals set forth in
Executive Orders S-3-059 and B-16-2012.10 It also recommended the need for a 2030
mid-term target to establish a continuum of actions to maintain and continue reductions,
rather than only focusing on targets for 2020 or 2050.

Building on California’s Environmental Legacy

California’s successful climate policies and programs have already delivered emission
reductions resulting from cleaner, more fuel-efficient cars and zero emission vehicles
(ZEVs), cleaner low carbon fuels, more renewable energy, greater waste diversion from
landfills, water conservation, improved forest management, and additional actions to
improve the energy efficiency of homes and businesses. These policies and programs
have also improved public health, created green jobs, and given consumers more clean
energy choices. The 2030 GHG emissions reduction target in SB 32 will ensure that the
State maintains this momentum beyond 2020, mindful of the State’s population growth
and needs. The Proposed Plan lays out a path to simultaneously make progress on the
State’s climate goals and improve air quality improvement in all parts of the State.
Moving forward, California’s climate strategy will require contributions from all sectors of
the economy, including the land base, and will include enhanced focus on zero- and
near-zero emission (ZE/NZE) vehicle technologies; continued investment in
renewables, including solar roofs, wind, and other distributed generation; greater use of
low carbon fuels; integrated land conservation and development strategies; coordinated
efforts to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants (methane, black carbon, and
fluorinated gases); and an increased focus on integrated land use planning, to support
livable, transit-connected communities and conservation of agricultural and other lands.
Requirements for direct GHG reductions at refineries will further support air quality
co-benefits in neighborhoods, including in disadvantaged communities historically
located adjacent to these large stationary sources, as well as efforts with California’s
local air pollution control and air quality management districts (air districts) to tighten
emission limits on a broad spectrum of industrial sources. Analyses indicate that
continuing the Cap-and-Trade Program would provide compliance flexibility, as the
lowest cost GHG emission reductions would be undertaken first, continue opportunities
to collaborate with other regions and achieve even greater GHG emission reductions.
Further, proceeds collected through the Cap-and Trade Program in the Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) can contribute to residents in disadvantaged communities
having equitable access to clean technology, clean energy options, transit options, and
infrastructure improvements that reduce GHGs and improve quality of life. Finally,
meeting the State’s climate, public health, and environmental goals will entail
understanding, quantifying, and addressing emissions impacts from land use decisions
at all governmental levels.
4.

Purpose of the 2030 Target Scoping Plan Update

The 2030 limit puts California on the path to meeting the 2050 GHG emission reduction
goal. However, the State’s long-term climate goal can only be achieved by employing a
coordinated policy framework. This Proposed Plan incorporates and leverages many
existing and ongoing efforts while identifying new policies to progress toward the State’s
climate and air quality goals.

6

The actions identified in this Proposed Plan can reduce overall GHG emissions in
California, and deliver strong policy signals that will continue to drive investment and
certainty in a low carbon economy. The Proposed Plan builds upon the successful
framework established by the Initial Scoping Plan and First Update, while also
identifying new, technologically feasibility and cost-effective strategies to ensure that
California meets its GHG reduction targets in a way that promotes and rewards
innovation, continues to foster economic growth, and delivers improvements to the
environment and public health, including in disadvantaged communities. The Proposed
Plan is developed to be consistent with requirements set forth in AB 32, SB 32, and
AB 197. The plan includes policies to require direct GHG reductions at some of the
State’s largest stationary sources and mobile sources. These policies include the use
of lower GHG fuels, efficiency regulations, and the Cap-and-Trade Program, which
constrains and reduces emissions at covered sources.
5.

Process for Developing the Proposed 2030 Target Scoping
Plan Update

This plan has been developed in an open and transparent manner, involving
coordination with State agencies, engagement with the Legislature, and the opportunity
for stakeholders and the public to engage in the process through workshops and other
meetings. This plan was developed in close coordination with other State agency plans
and regulations, including the Cap-and-Trade Regulation, the Low Carbon Fuel
Standard (LCFS), the State Implementation Plan, the California Sustainable Freight
Action Plan, California Transportation Plan 2040, the Forest Carbon Plan, and the
Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Strategy, among others.
To date, CARB, in collaboration with the Governor’s Office and other State agencies,
has solicited comments and feedback from affected stakeholders and the
Environmental Justice Advisory Committee (EJAC or Committee) that has informed the
Proposed Plan. Below is a list of the public workshops and symposia where the
development of the Proposed Plan has been discussed:

One key message conveyed during engagement with the legislature, EJAC, and
environmental justice communities was the need to place more emphasis on large
stationary sources, with a particular focus on multi-pollutant strategies for these sources
that reduce GHGs and harmful criteria and toxic air pollutants that result in localized
health impacts, especially in disadvantaged communities. Another consistent message
was the need for infrastructure and other community improvements that enhance quality
of life, increase access to safe and viable transportation options, and improve physical
activity and related health outcomes.

Updated Climate Science Supports the Need for More Action

Climate scientists agree that global warming trends and other shifts in the climate
system observed over the past century are caused by human activities. These
changes are proceeding at an unprecedented rate when compared with climate
change that human society has lived through to date.11 According to new research,
unabated GHG emissions could allow sea levels to rise close to two meters in total
(more than six feet) by the end of this century—nearly twice as much as previously
predicted—an outcome that could devastate coastal communities in California and
around the globe.12

California is already feeling the effects of climate change, and projections show that
these effects will continue and worsen over the coming centuries. The impacts of
climate change have been reported by the Office of Environmental Health Hazard
Assessment (OEHHA) in the climate change indicators report, which reports the
following changes occurring already:13






A recorded increase in annual average temperatures, as well as increases in
daily minimum and maximum temperatures,
An increase in the occurrence of extreme events, including wildfire and heat
waves,
A reduction in spring runoff volumes, as a result of declining snowpack,
A decrease in winter chill hours, necessary for the production of high-value fruit
and nut crops, and
Changes in the timing and location of species sightings, including migration
upslope of flora and fauna, and earlier appearance of Central Valley butterflies.

In addition to these trends, the State’s current conditions point to a changing climate.
California is in the middle of an historic drought. Recent scientific studies show that
such extreme drought conditions are more likely to occur under a changing climate.14,15
The total statewide economic cost of the 2013–2014 drought was estimated at
$2.2 billion, with a total loss of 17,100 jobs.16 In the Central Valley, the current drought
has cost California agriculture about $2.7 billion and more than 20,000 jobs in 2015,
which highlights the critical need for developing drought resilience, even if wet
conditions mitigate the current drought.17 Drought affects other sectors as well. An
analysis of the amount of water consumed in meeting California’s energy needs
between 1990 and 2012 shows that while California’s energy policies have supported
climate mitigation efforts, they have increased vulnerability to climate impacts,
especially greater hydrologic uncertainty.18
California has always been drought-prone, but the severity of this current drought
(2013 was the driest year on record for the State, 2014 was the fourth driest, while
2015 was the warmest year on record) have led many to wonder whether global
warming may be a contributing factor. Hence, several recent publications carefully
examined the potential role of climate change in the California drought. One study
examined both precipitation and runoff in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River
basins, and found that 10 of the past 14 years have been below normal, and the past

three years have been the driest and hottest in the full instrumental record from 1895
through November 2014.19 In another study, the authors show that the increasing
co-occurrence of dry years with warm years raises the risk of drought, highlighting the
critical role of elevated temperatures in altering water availability and increasing
overall drought intensity and impact.20 Generally, there is growing risk of
unprecedented drought in the western United States driven primarily by rising
temperatures, regardless of whether or not there is a clear precipitation trend.21
According to the U.S. Forest Service report, National Insect and Disease Forest Risk
Assessment, 2013–2027 (Krist et al. 2012), California is at risk of losing at least
25 percent of standing live forest due to insects and disease over 5.7 million acres, or
12 percent of the total forested area in the State. Some species are expected to lose
significant amounts of their total basal area (i.e., whitebark pine is projected to lose
60 percent of its basal area; lodgepole pine, 40 percent). While future climate change
is not modeled within the risk assessment, and current drought conditions are not
accounted for in these estimates, the projected climate changes over the next
15 years are expected to increase significantly the number of acres at risk, and will
increase the risk from already highly destructive pests such as the mountain pine
beetle. Extensive tree mortality is already prevalent in California. The western pine
beetle and other bark beetles have killed a majority of the ponderosa pine in the
foothills of the central and southern Sierra Nevada Mountains. A recent aerial survey
by the U.S. Forest Service identified more than 100 million dead trees in
California.22 As there is usually a lag time between drought years and tree mortality,
we are now beginning to see a sharp rise in mortality from the past four years of
drought. In response to the very high levels of tree mortality, Governor Brown issued
an Emergency Proclamation on October 30, 2015.
A warming climate also causes sea level to rise; first, by warming the oceans which
causes the water to expand, and second, by melting land ice which transfers water to
the ocean. Even if storms do not become more intense and/or frequent, sea level rise
itself will magnify the adverse impact of any storm surge and high waves on the
California coast. Some observational studies report that the largest waves are already
getting higher and winds are getting stronger.23 The ocean is also changing as
temperatures warm and GHG concentrations increase. Carbon dioxide is dissolving
in the ocean, making it more acidic. More acidic ocean water affects a wide variety of
marine species, including species that people use for food. This fundamental change
is likely to have substantial ecological and economic consequences in California and

worldwide.24
A growing body of scientific evidence also shows that healthy tropical forests are
central to solving climate change, as tropical forests exchange large amounts of water
and energy with the atmosphere (affecting atmospheric rivers), controlling regional
and global climate. Atmospheric rivers are relatively narrow regions in the
atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor
outside of the tropics. Deforestation and climate change have the capacity to alter
rainfall regimes, water availability, and surface-atmosphere flux of water and energy of
tropical forests. Between 2010 and 2015, despite some successful efforts at reducing
the global rate of deforestation, trends continued to show losses of upwards of
6.6 million hectares per year, mainly from loss of natural forests in the tropics.
Tropical deforestation accounts for about 15 percent of global GHG emissions—larger
than the entire global transportation sector. Preserving tropical forests will help meet
the aggressive global emissions reduction targets necessary to avoid catastrophic
climate change and may help to preserve California’s historical rainfall patterns.
While more intense dry periods are anticipated under warmer conditions, extremes on
the wet end of the spectrum are also expected to increase, due to more frequent
warm, wet atmospheric river events and a higher proportion of precipitation falling as
rain instead of snow. In recent years, atmospheric rivers have also been recognized
as the cause of the large majority of major floods in rivers all along the U.S. West
Coast and as the source of 30–50 percent of all precipitation in the same region.25
These extreme precipitation events, together with the rising snowline, often cause
devastating floods in major river basins (e.g., California’s Russian River). It was
estimated that the top 50 observed floods in the U.S. Pacific Northwest were due to
atmospheric rivers.26 Looking ahead, computer
models predict that climate change will cause the
Climate Impacts at the
very worst atmospheric river storms hitting
Community Level
California to become much more frequent and
larger.
To better understand how
Sea level rise, droughts, floods, and forest impacts
are just some of the environmental systems
disrupted by climate change. As GHG emissions
continue to accumulate and climate disruption
grows, such destructive events will become more
frequent. The historical record, which once set our
expectations for the traditional range of weather
and other natural events, is becoming an
increasingly unreliable predictor of the conditions

we will face in the future. Climate disruption can drive extreme weather events such
as coastal storm surges, drought, wildfires, floods, and heat waves. Effective climate
policy must be based in the best available science, so California is committed to
further supporting new research on ways to mitigate climate change and how to
understand its ongoing and projected impacts. California’s Fourth Climate Change
Assessment further updates our understanding of the many impacts from climate
change in a way that directly informs State agencies’ efforts to safeguard the State’s
people, economy, and environment.
Together, current conditions and future projections provide a picture of California’s
changing climate, with two important messages:



Change is already being experienced and documented across California, and
some of these changes have been directly linked to changing climatic conditions.
Even with the uncertainty in future climate conditions, every scenario estimates
further change in future conditions.

It is critical that California continue to take steps to reduce GHG emissions in order to
avoid the worst of the projected impacts of climate change. At the same time, the
State is taking steps to make the State more resilient to ongoing and projected climate
impacts as laid out by the Safeguarding California plan.27 Safeguarding California is
being updated in 2017 with new policy recommendations and more actions to address
California. California’s efforts are vital steps toward minimizing the impact of GHG
emissions and the three-pronged approach of reducing emissions, preparing for
impacts, and conducting cutting-edge research can serve as a model for action.

California’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the 2030 Target
1.

Progress Toward Achieving the 2020 Limit

California has made progress toward achieving the 2020 statewide GHG target while
also reducing criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants and supporting economic
growth. As shown in Figure I-1, in 2014, total GHG emissions decreased by
2.8 MMTCO2e compared to 2013, representing an overall decrease of 9.4 percent since
peak levels in 2004. The 2014 GHG Emission Inventory and a description of the
methodology updates can be accessed at: www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/inventory.htm.
AB 32 directs CARB to develop and track GHG emissions and progress toward the
target. California Health and Safety Code section 38505 identifies seven GHGs that
CARB is responsible for monitoring and regulating to reduce emissions: carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF 3).
The fluorinated gases are also referred to as “high global warming potential gases”

(high-GWP gases). California’s annual statewide GHG emission inventory has
historically been the primary tool for tracking GHG emissions trends.
The 2014 GHG Emission Inventory includes improved methodology updates. For
example, to align the GHG inventory with the IPCC guidelines and share consistent
methods with other subnational jurisdictions, CARB is now separating biogenic CO2
from transportation fuels from the total emissions and tracking those emissions
separately as informational items (beginning with 2014 reporting). Figure I-1 provides
the GHG inventory trend using this new method. Additional information on the
methodology for the GHG inventory can also be found at:

Carbon dioxide is the primary GHG emitted in California, accounting for 84 percent of
total GHG emissions in 2014, as shown in Figure I-2 below. Figure I-3 illustrates that
transportation, primarily on-road travel, is the single largest source of CO2 emissions in
California. Electricity production and industrial and residential sources also are
important contributors to CO2 emissions. Methane is the second most important GHG
in California, accounting for 9 percent of California’s 2014 GHG emissions in CO2
equivalent units. Agriculture accounts for the majority of methane emissions, primarily
from livestock enteric fermentation and manure management. Industrial sources and
landfills are also important methane sources. Other sources contribute only a small
fraction to methane emissions, and include residential, transportation, electricity
generation, and commercial sources. Agriculture accounts for the majority of N 2O
emissions, primarily from fertilizer and manure added to soil. Transportation and
commercial and residential use of nitrogen fertilizer on turf are also important sources of
13

N2O. Industrial sources of N2O include solid waste and wastewater treatment,
manufacturing, refining, and other sources.
High-GWP gases are fluorinated gases (F-gases) with GWPs hundreds to thousands of
times greater than that of carbon dioxide. These gases are used across many different
economic sectors, including energy, industry, commercial, residential, and
transportation. High-GWP gases include: sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). SF6, PFCs, and NF3
are long-lived F-gases whose emissions are being reduced by CARB regulations
covering the semiconductor industry, electrical transmission, magnesium casting, and
miscellaneous SF6 uses. HFCs are short-lived climate pollutant synthetic gases used in
refrigeration, air conditioning, insulating foams, solvents, aerosol products, and fire
protection. HFCs comprise approximately 97 percent of the high-GWP gas emissions,
and 4 percent of all GHG emissions from all sources, but are the fastest growing GHG
emissions source globally as HFCs continue to replace ozone-depleting substances.
Figures I-2 and I-3 show State GHG emission contributions by pollutant and sector
based on the 2014 GHG Emission Inventory.
Figure I-2. Emissions by GHG

Figure I-3. Emissions by Sector

Another important climate-forcing pollutant not listed among the Kyoto Protocol gases is
black carbon, which is also a short-lived climate pollutant. CARB has developed a
statewide emission inventory for black carbon in support of the Proposed SLCP
Strategy, which is reported in two categories: non-forestry (anthropogenic) sources and
forestry sources.28 The State’s major anthropogenic sources of black carbon include
off-road transportation, on-road transportation, residential wood burning, fuel
combustion, and industrial processes (Figure I-4). The forestry category includes nonagricultural prescribed burning and wildfire emissions. For forest-related sources,
wildfires account for the majority of black carbon emissions during a typical year.
28

Per SB 1383, the Proposed SLCP Strategy only addresses anthropogenic black carbon. The Forest Carbon Plan will include the
goal to reduce black carbon emissions from unmanaged wildfire events through forest management and restoration activities that
are designed to reduce the risk of wildfire.

14

Because the extent and severity of wildfire varies from year to year, the State’s black
carbon inventory uses a 10-year average of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions
from wildfire to represent average conditions and avoid large variations (Table I-1).
More information on CARB’s black carbon inventory can be found at:

The exchange of CO2 between the atmosphere and California’s natural and working
lands sector is not currently quantified and therefore, not included in the inventory. A
natural and working lands carbon inventory is essential for monitoring land-based
activities that may increase or decrease carbon sequestration over time. CARB staff is
working to develop a comprehensive inventory of GHG fluxes from all of California’s
natural and working lands using IPCC design principles. CARB released the Natural
and Working Lands Inventory with the 2017 Scoping Plan Updated Discussion Draft.29
This inventory provides an estimate of GHG emissions reductions and changes in
carbon stock from some carbon pools in agricultural and natural and working lands.
The CARB Natural and Working Lands Inventory includes an inventory of carbon
stocks, stock-change (and by extension GHG flux associated with stock-change) with
some attribution by disturbance process for the analysis period 2001–2010.
Disturbance processes would include activities such as conversion from one land
category to a different category, fire, and harvest. The CARB Natural and Working

Lands Inventory covers varieties of forests and woodlands, grasslands, and wetlands
(biomass-stock-change only). The CARB Natural and Working Lands Inventory
includes default carbon densities for croplands and urban/developed lands to facilitate
stock-change estimation for natural lands that convert to cropland, natural lands that
convert to developed lands, and for croplands that convert to developed lands.
2.

Setting the 2030 Statewide Target

The 2030 target set by SB 32 of 40 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2030 reflects
the same science that informs the agreement reached in Paris by the 2015 Conference
of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (IPCC),
aimed at keeping the global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius (°C). The
California 2030 statewide target represents the most ambitious GHG reduction goal for
North America. Based on the emissions reductions directed by SB 32, the annual 2030
statewide target emissions level for California is 260 MMTCO2e.
3.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions Tracking

California maintains a GHG inventory that is consistent with IPCC practices to allow for
comparison of the statewide GHG emissions with those at the national level and with
other international GHG inventories. Statewide GHG emissions are calculated using
many data sources. The primary data source is from reports submitted to CARB
through the Regulation for the Mandatory Reporting of GHG Emissions (MRR). MRR
requires facilities and entities with more than 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MTCO2e) of combustion and process emissions, all facilities belonging to
certain industries, and all electric power entities to submit an annual GHG emissions
data report directly to CARB. Reports from facilities and entities that emit more than
25,000 MTCO2e are verified by a CARB-accredited third-party verification body. More
information on MRR emissions reports can be found at:
www.arb.ca.gov/cc/reporting/ghg-rep/reported-data/ghg-reports.htm.
CARB also relies on data from other California State and federal agencies to develop an
economy-wide GHG inventory for the State of California. All data sources used to
develop the GHG Inventory are listed in the GHG Emission Inventory supporting
documentation at: www.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/data/data.htm.
Concurrently, other State agencies, nonprofit organizations, and research institutions
are developing and testing methodologies and models to quantify GHG fluxes from
California’s natural and working lands. CARB’s ongoing work on this inventory will
serve as one source of data to gauge the scope of GHG reduction potential from
California’s natural and working lands and monitor progress over time. CARB will
evaluate other data sources and methodologies for use in validating or supporting the
CARB inventory or project-scale tracking. Interagency work is also underway to
integrate and account for the land use and management impacts of development,
transportation, housing, and energy policies.

16

Greenhouse gas mitigation action may cross geographic borders as part of international
and subnational collaboration, or as a natural result of implementation of regional
policies. It is important to be able to track and attribute GHG reductions toward action
and ensure any reductions claimed are real, without any double counting. CARB has
begun exploring how to build an accounting framework that utilizes existing program
data to better reflect the broader benefits of our policies. The ability for subnational
regions to account for shared results of collaborative efforts, such as a linked cap-andtrade program, is important to support continued collaborative action at this level.
California believes data transparency is critical to demonstrate real progress toward
reducing GHGs in any context and fully understanding the impact of GHG mitigation
policies.

D.

California’s Approach to Addressing Climate Change
1.

Integrated Systems

A comprehensive approach is needed to achieve the State’s climate goals. Therefore,
this Proposed Plan integrates and builds upon multiple ongoing State efforts. For
example, as we address future mobility, we must show how existing efforts underway—
such as the California Sustainable Freight Action Plan, Mobile Source Strategy,
California Transportation Plan 2040, High-Speed Rail,30 urban planning, and goals for
enhancement of the natural environment—can complement each other while providing
multiple environmental benefits, including air quality and climate benefits. Each of these
efforts is important in its own right, but considered together they provide insights into the
synergies and conflicts between policies and demonstrate how the State will move
toward a sustainable and resilient future. For example, land disturbance due to
increased renewables through utility scale wind and solar and transmission can release
GHGs from soil and disturb grasslands and rangelands that have the potential to
sequester carbon. Further, policies that support sustainable land use not only reduce
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and its related emissions, but also avoid land disturbance
that could result in GHG emissions or loss of sequestration potential in the natural
environment. Identifying these types of trade-offs, and designing policies and
implementation strategies to support goals across all sectors, will require ongoing
efforts at the local, regional, and State level to ensure that sustainable action across
both the built and natural environments help to achieve the State’s long-term climate
goals.
2.

Promoting Resilient Economic Growth

The existing policies, strategies, plans, and regulations that we already have in place
are helping many California businesses to better compete in a global economy, and
have created new investments, businesses, and jobs to support a clean energy
economy. We have learned that California’s portfolio-based climate strategy can

Responsibility Pledge, which was commended by the Secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as part of

17

achieve great success when accompanied by consistent and rigorous GHG monitoring
and reporting, a robust public process, and an effective enforcement program for the
few that choose not to play by the rules. Our experience has also shown us that
California’s economy and infrastructure can be strengthened while also achieving other
important environmental benefits such as reductions in criteria pollutants and toxic air
contaminants, especially in California’s most vulnerable communities.
The benefits to be achieved consistent with the Proposed Plan are part of California’s
comprehensive strategy to achieve lasting emissions reductions throughout the
economy. California’s strategic vision for achieving at least a 40 percent reduction in
GHG emissions by 2030 is based on the principle that economic prosperity and
environmental sustainability can be achieved together. Undertaking the actions that are
presented in Proposed Plan presents opportunities for the future, but progress toward
our goals is already evident today. For example, in 2015, California added more than
20,000 new jobs in the solar sector. This was more than half of the new jobs in this
industry across the nation. Employment in the clean economy grew by 20 percent
between 2002 and 2012, which included the period of economic recession around
2008.31 Shifting to clean, local, and efficient uses of energy reinvests our energy
expenditures in our local economies and reduces risks to our economy associated with
exposure to volatile global and national oil and gas commodity prices. Indeed, a clean
economy is a resilient economy.
Achieving our global goals requires a structural shift in the global economy, which is
already underway. Successfully driving this transition will require cleaner and more
efficient technologies, new policies and incentives that better recognize and reward
innovation, and prioritizing low carbon investments. It also requires new policies and
incentives at multiple jurisdictional levels to ensure that this transition advances land
use and natural resource management objectives for both GHG mitigation and climate
adaptation. Synergistic linkages between technological advances and resource
stewardship must be intentional to be successful, and must result in sustainable
development. These efforts are already underway, as highlighted through the
development and implementation of Sustainable Communities Strategies (SCSs)
pursuant to Senate Bill (SB) 375, which link transportation, housing, and climate policy,
and are designed to reduce per capita GHG emissions while providing benefits ranging
from improved air quality and expanded transportation options to revitalization of city
centers and investment in disadvantaged communities. SB 375 is just one of many
ways to address housing and transportation needs and provide climate benefits. The
Proposed Plan identifies new ways to promote the technologies and infrastructure
required to meet our collective climate goals, while also presenting the vision for
California’s continuing efforts to foster a sustainable, clean energy economy.

Protecting, Enhancing, Innovating, and Increasing
Sequestration in the Natural Environment and Working Lands

California’s natural and working lands make the State a global leader in agriculture, a
U.S. leader in forest products, and a global biodiversity hotspot. These lands support
clean air, wildlife and pollinator habitat, and rural economies, and are critical
components of California’s water infrastructure. Keeping these lands and waters intact
and at high levels of ecological function (including resilient carbon sequestration) is
necessary for the well-being and security of Californians in 2030, 2050, and beyond.
Forests, rangelands, farms, wetlands, riparian areas, deserts, coastal areas, and the
ocean store substantial carbon in biomass and soils.
Natural and working lands are a key sector in the State’s climate change strategy.
Substantially storing carbon in trees, other vegetation, soils, and aquatic sediment is the
most effective way to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This Proposed Plan
includes policies and programs that prioritize protection and enhancement of
California’s landscapes, including urban landscapes, and identifies the next steps to
ensure management actions are taken to increase the sequestration potential of those
resources. We cannot ignore the relationships between sectors or the adverse impacts
that climate change is having on the environment itself. We must consider important
trade-offs in developing the State’s climate strategy by understanding the near and
long-term impacts of various policy scenarios and actions on our State and local
communities.
4.

Improving Public Health

The State has committed to addressing public health issues, including addressing
chronic and infectious diseases, controlling tobacco, providing nutrition education and
obesity prevention, reducing occupational and other types of injuries, promoting mental
health, and protecting communities from environmental exposures and toxins. As part
of these efforts, California has been protecting and improving air quality for more than
50 years. State and local regulations have been a model for other states, the federal
government, and other countries. Our drive to improve air quality and promote
community health and well-being will continue to remain a priority as we address
climate change. Several of the strategies included in this plan were primarily developed
to help the State achieve ambient air quality standards for air pollutants with direct
health impacts, while also delivering GHG reductions.
Climate change itself is already affecting the health of our communities and is
exacerbating existing health inequities. Those facing the greatest health burdens
include low-income individuals and households, the very young and the very old,
communities of color, and those who have been marginalized or discriminated against
based on gender or race/ethnicity.32 Economic factors, such as income, poverty, and

wealth, are among the strongest determinants of health. Addressing climate change
presents a significant opportunity to improve public health for all of California’s residents
and to further our work toward making our State the healthiest in the nation.
To successfully address public health inequities, we must continue to address
environmental concerns in disadvantaged communities. At the same time, to achieve
the 2030 target and the longer-term 2050 target, we must move forward with
sustainable development. The United Nations defines sustainable development as
“development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of
the future generations to meet their own needs.”33 By identifying and addressing the
disproportionate impacts felt today and planning, designing, and implementing actions
for a sustainable future, we can be part of the solution to make public health inequities
an issue of the past.
5.

Environmental Justice

Fair and equitable climate action requires that the inequities that create and intensify
community vulnerabilities be addressed. The capacity for resilience in the face of
climate change is significantly driven by living conditions and the forces that shape
them, such as access to services such as health care, healthy foods, air and water, and
safe spaces for physical activity; income; education; housing; transportation;
environmental quality; and good health status. Thus, strategies such as alleviating
poverty, increasing access to economic opportunities, improving living conditions, and
reducing health and social inequities will result in more climate-resilient communities.
Promoting a low carbon California economy will reduce GHG emissions and create a
healthier environment for all of California’s residents, especially those living in the
State’s most disadvantaged communities. We must also recognize there is a need to
tailor policies to address the unique characteristics of economically distressed
communities in the State’s rural areas.
The impacts of climate change and the health inequities in our communities share
similar root causes: the inequitable distribution of social, political, and economic power.
These power imbalances result in systems (i.e., economic, transportation, land use
zoning, etc.) and conditions that drive both health inequities and GHG emissions. As a
result, we see communities with inequitable living conditions, such as low-income
communities of color living in more polluted areas, facing climate change impacts that
compound and exacerbate existing sensitivities and vulnerabilities. Effective climate
action requires that the inequities that create and intensify community vulnerabilities be
addressed.
It is critical that environmental justice communities share in the benefits of the cleaner
economy that California is building, including environmental and economic benefits. An
example of this is that low-income customers that are enrolled in the California Alternate
Rates for Energy (CARE) Program or the Family Electric Rate Assistance (FERA)
Program are also eligible to receive a rebate under the California Climate Credit, or a

credit on residential and small business energy bills resulting from the sale of
allowances received by investor-owned utilities as part of the Cap-and-Trade Program.
SB 1018 (Committee on Budget and Fiscal Review, Chapter 39, Statutes of 2012) and
other implementing legislation requires that Cap-and-Trade Program auction monies
deposited into the GGRF be used to further the purposes of AB 32, while also fostering
job creation by promoting in-state GHG emissions reduction projects carried out by
California workers and businesses.
Further, SB 535 (De Leon, Chapter 830, Statutes of 2012) and AB 1550 (Gomez,
Chapter 369, Statutes of 2016) direct State and local agencies to make significant
investments from monies deposited into the GGRF that improve California’s most
vulnerable communities. Specifically, these laws require that at least 35 percent of
GGRF monies benefit

As with the Initial Scoping Plan and First Update, this Proposed Plan development
process to date includes extensive consultation with the EJAC. The consultation for this
Proposed Plan also included extensive consultation and engagement directly with
disadvantaged communities through 11 community meetings hosted by the EJAC and
held throughout the State (see below).
Public Committee Meetings
The Committee has met twelve times across California since December 2015 to discuss
this 2030 Target Scoping Plan and develop recommendations.
Statewide Community Engagement Meetings
Starting in July 2016, the EJAC hosted with CARB support, a robust community
engagement process, conducting 11 community meetings throughout the State and
collecting over 700 individual comments. The community meetings were well received
and attended by several hundred residents and local community representatives.
Additional community meetings are being planned through spring 2017.

To enhance the community engagement, CARB staff coordinated with staff from local
government agencies and sister agencies. At the community meetings, staff from State
and local agencies participated in extensive, topic-specific “world café” discussions with
local residents at these meetings. The extensive collaboration between the EJAC,
State agencies, and local agencies provided local residents the opportunity to meet with
local advocates and local and State government officials to share concerns and provide
input on ways California can meet its 2030 target while addressing a number of related
issues and concerns.
EJAC Recommendations
The EJAC’s recommendations for the Proposed Plan were informed by comments
received at community meetings listed above and Committee member expertise.
Recommendations were provided for the sector focus areas, overarching environmental
justice policy, and California Climate Investments. The Committee also sorted their
recommendations into five themes: partnership with environmental justice communities,
equity, economic opportunity, coordination, and long-term vision. Finally, the EJAC
provided direction that their recommendations are intended “to be read and
implemented holistically and not independently of each other.”
The EJAC’s overarching recommendations for partnership with environmental justice
communities, equity, coordination, economic opportunity, and long-term vision include
the following recommendations:
 Encourage long-term community engagement, a culture shift in California, and
neighborhood-level solutions to promote the implementation of the State’s
climate plans, using strategies identified by the Committee.

Improve the balance of reducing greenhouse gases and compliance costs with
other AB 32 goals of improving air quality in environmental justice communities
while maximizing benefits for all Californians.
Consider public health impacts and equity when examining issues in any sector
and have CARB conduct an equity analysis on the Proposed Plan and each
sector, with guidance from the Committee.
Develop metrics to ensure actions are meeting targets and develop contingency
plans for mitigation and adjustment if emissions increases occur as programs
are implemented.
Coordinate strategies between State, federal, and local agencies for strong,
enforceable, evidence-based policies to prevent and address sprawl with equity
at the center.
Maximize the accessibility of safe jobs, incentives, and economic benefits for
Californians and the development of a just transition for workers and
communities in and around polluting industries.
Ensure that AB 32 economic reviewers come from various areas around the
State to represent insights on economic challenges and opportunities from
those regions.
Do not limit the Proposed Plan to examining interventions and impacts until
2030, or even 2050. Plan and analyze on a longer-term scale to prevent shortsighted mistakes and reach the long-term vision, as actions today and for the
next 30 years will have impacts for seven generations.
The Proposed Plan must prioritize GHG reductions and investments in
California environmental justice communities first, before other California
communities; and the innovation of new technologies or strategies to reach
even deeper emissions cuts, whenever possible.
Convene the Committee beyond the Scoping Plan development process.

The Committee’s key Energy sector recommendations include developing aggressive
energy goals toward 100 percent renewable energy by 2030, including a vision for a
clean energy economy, and prioritizing actions in disadvantaged communities.
Highlights of the Green Building sector recommendations include setting goals for green
buildings, enforcing GHG reduction targets for existing buildings, and providing
upgrades that enable buildings to use renewable energy technologies and water
capture. Key Water sector recommendations include encouraging water conservation
and recycling and prioritizing safe drinking water for all.
The Committee’s key Industry sector recommendations include prioritizing direct
emissions reductions in environmental justice communities and replacing the Cap-andTrade Program with a carbon tax or fee and dividend program. The Committee also
recommends eliminating offsets and the allocation of free allowances if the Cap-andTrade Program continues.
The Committee’s key Transportation sector recommendations include increasing
access to affordable, reliable, clean, and safe mobility options in disadvantaged
24

communities, community-friendly land use planning, maximizing electrification, and
restricting sprawl.
The Committee’s key Natural and Working Lands, Agriculture, and Waste sector
recommendations include diverting waste, returning carbon to the soil, not burning
biomass, supporting healthy soils as a critical element to land and waste management,
and integrating urban forestry within local communities.
Finally, the Committee provided recommendations for California Climate Investments.
Those include ensuring that near-term technologies do not adversely impact
communities and long-term investments move toward zero emissions, requiring GGRF
projects to be transformative for disadvantaged communities as defined by each
community, and eliminating funding for AB 32 regulated entities.
The EJAC’s recommendations, in their entirety, are included in Appendix A and
available at:www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ejac/ejac_recommendations_proposed_plan122216.pdf.
At the EJAC’s December 21–22, 2016 meeting, CARB provided the Committee with
information about how their recommendations were incorporated in the Discussion
Draft. CARB will update this information to reflect the Committee’s current
recommendations, as provided in Appendix A. CARB is also in the process of providing
the Committee with information about the recommendations not incorporated in the
Proposed Plan, which will be used as the Committee develops its final
recommendations for the Final Plan. The Committee will continue to hold regular public
meetings to discuss the Proposed Plan and formalize their recommendations to inform
the Final Plan. More information about the EJAC and recommendations on the
previous Scoping Plans and current Proposed Plan is located at: www.arb.ca.gov/ejac.

Relying on Sound Science and Research

Sound science underpins, updates, and strengthens climate policy. The scientific
record overwhelmingly and undeniably demonstrates that climate change is occurring.
It also connects human-related activities to the atmospheric burden of CO2 with
expansion at an unprecedented rate. In developing this Proposed Plan, time matters.
The policies that are included must lead rapidly to real results to avoid the most
catastrophic impacts of climate change. The Proposed Plan identifies policies based on
solid science and identifies additional research needs, while also recognizing the need
for flexibility in the face of a changing climate. Ongoing research to better understand
systems where our knowledge is weaker will allow for additional opportunities to set
targets and identify actionable policies.
7.

Setting the Path to 2050

While the Proposed Plan charts the path to achieving the 2030 GHG emissions
reduction target, we need momentum to propel us to the 2050 statewide GHG target
(80 percent below 1990 levels). In developing the Proposed Plan, we considered what
policies are needed for the mid-term and long-term, knowing that some policies for the
25

long-term must begin implementation now. For example, Zero Net Carbon Buildings is
an important strategy to achieve the 2050 target, but work must begin now to review
and evaluate research in this area, establish a planning horizon for targets, and identify
implementation mechanisms. At the same time, we need to consider policies for 2030
that do not simply dead end in 2030, but rather can continue to help support the State’s
long-term climate objectives. As with all investments, whether financial or personal, the
approach we take must balance risk, reward, longevity, and timing. For the forest
sector, are we comfortable with policies that may result in some near-term carbon loss,
but ultimately support more resilient and healthier forests in the longer time frame?
And, are we willing to pursue policies that we know are needed for the 2050 target, but
may not significantly reduce GHG emissions in the near-term?
Figure l-5 illustrates the potential GHG reductions that are possible by making
consistent progress between 2020 and the 2050, versus an approach that begins with
the 2030 target and then makes progress toward the 2050 level included in Executive
Order S-3-05. Depending on the success of our achieving the 2030 target, taking a
consistent approach may be possible and would help achieve the 2050 target earlier
and potentially prevent global warming of 1.5°C. The path to achieving the 2050 target
should leave open the possibility for both paths. Note that Figure I-5 does not include
emissions from or sequestration potential from the natural and working lands sector.

Intergovernmental Collaboration

Federal, State, and local action can be complementary. We have already seen federal
action through the Clean Air Act, regulations for GHG emissions from passenger cars
26

and trucks, development of the Clean Power Plan to limit GHGs from power plants, and
the advancement of methane rules for oil and gas production. There are also times
when California, working with other climate leaders, acts to advance more ambitious
federal action and protect the ability of states to move forward to address climate
change. Both collaboration and advocacy will mark the road ahead. However, to the
extent that California cannot implement policies or measures included in the Proposed
Plan because of the lack of federal support, the State will develop alternative measures
to achieve the reductions from the same sector to ensure we meet our GHG reduction
targets.
Regional and local governments and agencies are leaders in addressing climate
change and are uniquely positioned to reduce emissions from certain sources,
especially by reducing the demand for electricity, transportation fuels, and natural gas.
Many local governments have already initiated efforts to reduce GHG emissions beyond
those required by the State. For example, many cities and counties are improving their
municipal operations by upgrading their vehicle fleets, retrofitting government buildings
and streetlights, purchasing greener products, and implementing waste-reduction
policies. In addition, they are adopting more sustainable codes, standards, and general
plan improvements to reduce their community’s footprints and emissions. The State is
striving to provide a supportive framework to advance these and other local efforts,
while also recognizing the need to build on, and export, this success to other regional
and local governments through California and beyond.
Local actions are critical for implementation of California’s ambitious climate agenda.
Importantly, at the same time, State policies, programs, and actions—such as many of
those identified throughout this Proposed Plan—can help to support, incentivize, and
accelerate local actions to achieve mutual goals, and are indeed critical to achieving
both State and local goals and priorities for more sustainable and resilient communities.
Local municipal code changes, zoning changes, or policy directions that apply broadly
to the community within the general plan or climate action plan area can help promote
the deployment of renewable, zero emission, and low carbon technologies such as zero
net energy buildings, renewable fuel production facilities, and zero emission charging
stations. Local decision-making has an especially important role in achieving reductions
of GHG emissions generated from transportation. Over the last 60 years, development
patterns have led to sprawling suburban neighborhoods, a vast highway system, growth
in automobile ownership, and under-prioritization of infrastructure for public transit and
active transportation. Local decisions about these policies today can establish a more
sustainable built environment for the future. Local governments can incentivize locally
generated renewable energy and infrastructure for alternative fuels and electric
vehicles, implement water efficiency measures, develop waste-to-energy and waste-tofuel projects, and preserve and enhance carbon sequestration in both rural and urban
landscapes. Indeed, many local agencies are already implementing ambitious climate
strategies. These types of local actions complement statewide measures and may be
more cost-effective and provide more co-benefits than relying exclusively on top-down
statewide regulations to achieve the State’s climate stabilization goals. The Proposed

27

Plan explores the potential benefit of any regional or local targets to assist local
agencies in their efforts to address climate change.

International Efforts

California is not alone in its efforts to address climate change and is committed to
working at the international level to reduce global GHG emissions. The agreement
reached in Paris by the 2015 Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aimed at keeping the global temperature
rise below 2°C, is spurring action across the world. The results of this agreement will
translate into worldwide action to reduce GHGs and support decarbonization across the
global economy. And, it is not just action and coordination at the international and
national levels that is important. Subnational governments are front and center on this
issue. With the establishment of the Under 2 Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU),34,35 the Governors’ Climate and Forests Task Force,36 and the Western Climate
Initiative,37 among other partnership initiatives, subnational jurisdictions from the around
the world are collaborating on how best to address climate change and are leading the
way.
From its inception, AB 32 recognized the importance of California’s climate leadership
and engagement with other jurisdictions, and directed CARB to consult with the federal
government and other nations to identify the most effective strategies and methods to
reduce GHGs, manage GHG control programs, and to facilitate the development of
integrated and cost-effective regional, national, and international GHG reduction
programs. California undertook a two-pronged approach: first, we assessed our Statespecific circumstances to develop measures that would apply specifically in California;
and second, we simultaneously assessed which measures might lend themselves,
through careful design and collaboration with other interested jurisdictions, toward
linked GHG reduction programs. Under the Clean Air Act, California has a special role
as an innovator and leader in the area of motor vehicle emission regulations, which
allows our State to adopt motor vehicle emission standards that are stricter than federal
requirements. These motor vehicle standards have been emulated around the country
and the world, leading to widespread health benefits. Similarly, by enacting a
comprehensive strategy that can be exported nationally and internationally, California
can lead the world in tackling climate change.
Today, the State’s Cap-and-Trade Program is linked with Québec’s program; ongoing
discussions to link with Ontario’s emerging emissions trading system are underway.
34

Under 2 MOU website: under2mou.org/
One of the Brown Administration’s priorities is to highlight California’s climate leadership on the subnational level, and to ensure
that subnational activity is recognized at the international level. In the year preceding the Paris negotiations, the Governor’s Office
recruited subnational jurisdictions to sign onto the Memorandum of Understanding on Subnational Global Climate Leadership
(Under 2 MOU), which brings together states and regions willing to commit to reducing their GHG emissions by 80 to 95 percent, or
to limit emissions to 2 metric tons CO2-equivalent per capita, by 2050. The governor led a California delegation to the Paris
negotiations to highlight our successful climate programs and to champion subnational action and international cooperation on
meeting the challenge of reducing GHG emissions. By the end of 2016, nearly 170 jurisdictions representing more than 1 billion
people and more than one-third of the global economy had joined California in the Under 2 MOU.

Low carbon fuel mandates similar to California’s LCFS have been adopted by the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and by other jurisdictions
including Oregon, British Columbia, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.
Over two-dozen states have a renewables portfolio standard. California is a member of
the Pacific Coast Collaborative with Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon, and Washington,
who collaborate on issues such as energy and sustainable resource management,
among others.38 California continues to discuss carbon pricing through a cap-and-trade
program with international delegations. We have seen design features of the State’s
Cap-and-Trade Program incorporated into other emerging and existing programs, such
as the European Union Emissions Trading System and China’s emerging national
trading program.
Recognizing the need to address the substantial GHG emissions caused by the
deforestation and degradation of tropical forests, California worked with a group of
subnational governments to form the Governors’ Climate and Forests Task Force (GCF)
in 2008.39 The GCF is currently comprised of 35 different subnational jurisdictions—
including states and provinces in Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Mexico,
Nigeria, Peru, Spain, and the United States—that are contemplating or enacting
programs for low-emissions rural development and reduced emissions from
deforestation and land use. GCF members continue to engage in discussions to share
information and experiences about the design of such programs and how the programs
could potentially interact with carbon markets. Ongoing engagement between California
and its GCF partners, as well as ongoing discussions with other stakeholders, continues
to provide lessons on how such programs could fit within California’s Cap-and-Trade
Program.40
Further, California’s High-Speed Rail is part of the International Union of Railways
(UIC), and California has signed the Railway Climate Responsibility Pledge, which was
commended by the Secretary of the UNFCCC as part of achieving the global 2050
targets. This initiative is to demonstrate that rail transport is part of the solution for
sustainable and carbon free mobility.
California will continue to engage in multi-lateral forums that help develop the policy
foundation and technical infrastructure for GHG regulations in multiple jurisdictions.
Recognizing that many efforts around the world were underway to use market forces to
motivate GHG emission reductions, California worked with other governments to
establish the International Carbon Action Partnership (ICAP) in 2007. The ICAP

ARB staff identified the jurisdictional program in Acre, Brazil, as a program that is ready to be considered for linkage with
California, and has committed to proposing regulatory standards for assessing tropical forestry programs and to proposing a linkage
with the program in Acre as part of a future rulemaking process. From October 2015 to April 2016, ARB held public workshops that
addressed the potential of approving the use of sector-based offset credits from the tropical forestry sector within the Cap-and-Trade
Program. ARB will conduct additional stakeholder engagement before proposing any regulatory amendments. Furthermore,
reducing emissions from tropical deforestation is a key topic within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC) and between national and subnational jurisdictions, including through collaboration between California and the U.S.
Department of State. Continued evaluation of the tropical forestry sector and other sector-based offset programs further
demonstrates California’s ongoing climate leadership and could result in partnering on other mutually beneficial climate and low
emissions development initiatives, including measures to encourage sustainable supply chain efforts by public and private entities.

provides a forum for sharing experiences and knowledge among jurisdictions that have
already implemented or are actively pursuing market-based GHG programs.41 California
has also participated in meetings of the Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR), a
multilateral World Bank initiative that brings together more than 30 developed and
developing countries to share experiences and build capacity for climate change
mitigation efforts, particularly those implemented using market instruments.42 In
November 2014, CARB became a Technical Partner of the PMR, and CARB staff
members have provided technical information on the design and implementation of the
Cap-and-Trade Program at several PMR meetings.
Many foreign jurisdictions seek out California’s expertise because of our history of
success in addressing air pollution and climate change. California also benefits from
these interactions. Expanding global action to fight air pollution and climate change
expands markets for clean technology. This can bolster business for companies in
California developing clean energy products and services and help to bring down the
cost of those products globally and in California. Additionally, innovative policies and
lessons learned in our partners' jurisdictions can help inform future climate policies in
California.
Governor Brown’s focus on subnational collaborations on climate change and air quality
has strengthened and deepened California’s existing international relationships and
forged new ones. These relationships are a critical component of reducing emissions of
GHGs and other pollutants worldwide. As we move forward, CARB and other State
agencies will continue to communicate and collaborate with international partners to find
the most cost-effective ways to improve air quality and fight climate change, and to
share California’s experience and expertise in reducing air pollution and GHGs while
growing a strong economy.

II.

The Proposed Scenario

This chapter examines the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario along with four alternative
scenarios in terms of the most important criteria and priorities the State’s
comprehensive climate action must deliver. All the scenarios are set against what is
called the business-as-usual (BAU) yardstick—that is, what would the GHG emissions
look like if we did nothing at all beyond the existing policies that are required and
already in place to achieve the 2020 limit. It includes the existing renewables
requirements, advanced clean cars, the “10 percent” Low Carbon Fuel Standard, and
the SB 375 program for more vibrant communities, among others. However, it does not
include a range of new policies or measures that have been developed or put into
statute over the past two years.
The Reference scenario (BAU) shows continuing but modest reductions followed by a
later rise of GHG emissions as the economy and population grow. The comprehensive
analysis of all five alternatives indicates that the Proposed Scenario—continuing the
Cap-and-Trade Program with additional reductions from the refinery sector—is the clear
choice to achieve the State’s climate and clean air goals. It also protects public health,
provides a solid foundation for continued economic growth, and supports California’s
quality of life.
All of the alternative scenarios outlined in this chapter are the product of a process of
development informed by public input and Board and legislative direction over the
course of a year and a half. They also all include a range of additional measures
developed or required over the past two years with 2030 as their target date and
include: extending the LCFS to 18 percent reduction beyond 2020, the requirements of
SB 350 to increase renewables to 50 percent, and doubling energy efficiency savings.
They also all include the Mobile Source Strategy with its targets for more zero emission
vehicles and much cleaner trucks and transit, the Sustainable Freight Action Plan to
improve freight efficiency and transition to zero emission freight handling technologies,
and the requirements under SB 1383 to slash black carbon 50 percent, and
hydrofluorocarbon and methane emissions by 40 percent.
At this time, work is still underway on how to quantify the GHG emissions within the
natural and working lands sector. As such, the analyses in this chapter do not include
any estimates from this sector. Additional information on the current efforts to better
understand emissions fluxes and model the actions needed to support the goal of net
carbon sequestration in natural and working lands can be found in Chapter lV. Even
absent any quantification data, the large potential role for this sector in achieving the
State’s climate goals should be considered in conjunction with any efforts to reduce
GHG emissions in the energy and industrial sectors.
The alternatives CARB evaluated have evolved over time. The original 2016 Concept
Paper43 included the following scenarios: cap-and-trade, carbon tax, direct regulations
for all industry, and direct regulations for mobile GHG sources. Initial analysis indicated
43

ARB. State of California. 2016. 2030 Target Scoping Plan Update Concept Paper. June
17, 2016. https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/scopingplan/document/2030_sp_concept_paper2016.pdf

31

that neither of the latter two scenarios that focused on just prescriptive regulations in the
mobile or stationary source sectors could deliver the reductions needed to reach the
2030 target. This led to a three-scenario approach in the December 2016 Discussion
Draft44: cap-and-trade, a carbon tax, and only prescriptive regulations (on both industry
and mobile sources).
As a result of Board direction and public input, including that from the EJAC, the number
of alternative scenarios was increased to include the following:
Proposed Scenario: Continuing the Cap-and-Trade Program combined with an
additional 20 percent reduction of greenhouse gases in the refinery sector.
Alternative 1: Direct regulations on a wide variety of sectors, such as specific
required reductions for all large GHG sources, more renewables, etc.
Alternative 2: A carbon tax to put a price on carbon, instead of the Cap-andTrade Program.
Alternative 3: All Cap-and-Trade. This would remove the refinery measure and
keep the LCFS at 10 percent.
Alternative 4: Cap-and-Tax. This would place a declining cap on industry, and
natural gas and fuel suppliers, while also requiring them to pay a tax on each ton
of GHG emitted.
Since the statutory direction on GHG reductions is definitive, the issue of certainty of
reductions is paramount, and alternatives vary greatly as to the certainty of meeting the
target. The year-over-year reductions under a Cap-and Trade Program, for instance,
provide certain and measurable reductions over time; a carbon tax, while putting a price
on carbon to be sure, may not be enough to drive reductions by altering behavior.
Then there are other considerations: to what extent does an alternative meet the target,
but also deliver clean air benefits, prioritize reductions at large stationary sources, and
allow for continued investment in disadvantaged communities? Does an alternative
allow for California to link with other jurisdictions, and support the Clean Power Plan and
other federal climate programs? Does an alternative provide for flexibility for regulated
entities, and a cost-effective approach to reduce greenhouse gases?
On balance it is clear that the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario is the only alternative to
meet all the criteria.

A.

Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario

The development of the Proposed Plan began by first modeling a Reference scenario
(the BAU). The Reference scenario is the forecasted statewide GHG emissions through
2030 with existing policies and programs, but without any further action to reduce
GHGs. Figure ll-1 provides the modeling results for a Reference scenario for this

Proposed Plan. The graph shows the State is expected to reduce emissions below the
2020 statewide GHG target, but additional effort will be needed to maintain and
continue GHG reductions to meet the mid- (2030) and long-term (2050) targets. More
details about the modeling for the Reference scenario can be found in Appendix D.

The Proposed Plan is summarized in Table II-1. As shown in the table, most of the
measures are identified as “known commitments” (marked with “*”), meaning that they
are already underway or required. The known commitments are not part of the
Reference scenario in Figure ll-1. The two primary newly proposed measures are: (1) a
20 percent reduction by 2030 in GHG emissions in the refinery sector from 2014 levels,
and (2) a post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program.

Table ll-2 summarizes the results of the modeling for the Reference scenario and known
commitments. Per SB 32, the 2030 limit is 260 MMTCO2e. That is a limit in a specific
year. At approximately 392 MMTCO2e, the Reference scenario is expected to exceed
the 2030 limit by about 132 MMTCO2e.
Table II-2 also shows that there is a cumulative gap in required emission reductions of
680 MMTCO2e between 2021 and 2030 to achieve the 2030 limit. While there is no
statutory cumulative limit, the analysis considers and presents some results in
cumulative form for several reasons. It is important to note that policies and measures
may perform differently over time. For example, in early years, a policy or measure may
be slow to be deployed, but over time it has greater impact. If you were to look at its
performance in 2021 versus 2030, you would see that it may not seem important and
may not deliver significant reductions in the early years, but is critical for later years as it
results in greater reductions over time. A cumulative construct provides a more
complete way to evaluate the effectiveness of any measure over time, instead of just
considering a snapshot for a single year.

Also shown in the table, the known commitments are expected to result in emissions
that are 50 MMTCO2e above the target in 2030, and have a cumulative emissions
reduction gap of about 221 MMTCO2e. Consequently, for the Proposed Plan, the Post2020 Cap-and-Trade Program and refinery measure would need to deliver
221 MMTCO2e cumulative GHG emissions reductions from 2021 through 2030. The
refinery measure is estimated to account for about 30 MMTCO2e cumulatively from
2021 to 2030. Onsite action to improve combustion efficiency or process lighter crude
would also provide air quality co-benefits. If the estimated GHG reductions from the
known commitments and the refinery measure are not realized due to delays in
implementation or technology deployment, the post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program
would deliver the additional GHG reductions to ensure the 2030 target is achieved.
Figure ll-2 illustrates the cumulative emission reduction contributions of the known
commitments, the refinery measure, and the Cap-and-Trade Program from 2021 to
2030.

37

20 Percent Reduction in GHGs at Refineries
The refinery sector was chosen for direct regulation because it includes some of the
largest stationary sources of GHG emissions and is part of the largest economic sector
of GHG emissions—transportation. Further, this refinery measure prioritizes direct
GHG reductions at large stationary sources pursuant to AB 197. Studies have shown
that many of the largest sources of emissions are in disadvantaged communities, and in
addition to reducing GHG emissions it may provide co-benefits of reducing criteria
pollutants and toxic air contaminants in some of the most polluted and disadvantaged
communities in the State.
The proposed new regulation to achieve a 20 percent GHG reduction in the refinery
sector would require all refineries, by 2030, to achieve the benchmark of the most
efficient existing refinery on a simple barrel basis. An efficiency benchmark is reflected
as GHG emissions per unit of product. This regulation would not limit mass GHG
emissions, but would require facilities to become more efficient through any combination
of actions such as fuel switching; boiler electrification; onsite investments in newer,
more energy efficient technologies; use of lighter crude slates; and any other process
efficiencies that would be identified in consultation with local air districts and CARB. As
part of the development process for this measure, other metrics such as complexityweighted barrel may also be evaluated.
The potential effectiveness of this measure was determined by reviewing the
benchmarking data provided by the refineries when the Cap-and-Trade Regulation was
being developed. From those data, CARB staff was able to identify the most efficient
refinery in the State. Staff then assumed that all refineries could achieve this same
efficiency and calculated the resulting emissions using individual refinery production
data for 2014. A comparison between the actual reported emissions for 2014 and the
emissions calculated by assuming all refineries were as efficient as the most efficient
refinery allowed staff to compare the difference between the two values and estimate
the GHG difference. While not all refineries are designed the same way and each
would be starting from a different efficiency level, this measure assumes some
refineries may be able to do more than others to reduce their GHG emissions.
Therefore, the actual measure would need to accommodate unique circumstances at
individual facilities in this sector.
It would take time to develop and implement regulations for this measure. There would
likely need to be several different regulatory paths based on facility type. The final
control effectiveness could be different, pending a rulemaking effort that gathers more
detail about specific opportunities for reductions that would also need to account for
potential increased production activity, especially for biofuels.
One initial implementation step for this measure could be for the State to partner with
California’s local air districts, which traditionally permit these facilities for criteria
pollutants and toxic air contaminants. Together, the State and local air districts could
identify efficiency improvement opportunities for stationary source combustion
equipment. This strategy would be prioritized for all refinery facilities subject to the
38

Energy Efficiency Audit50 in the areas where Best Available Retrofit Control Technology
(BARCT) requirements are applicable.51 BARCT measures could be implemented
through the existing air district BARCT/All Feasible Measures process and would be
required to demonstrate reductions of criteria pollutants while accounting for GHG
emissions effects. The BARCT determinations also promote consistency of controls for
similar emission sources among districts with the same air quality attainment
designations. The BARCT/All Feasible Measures process could be required to
demonstrate reductions of criteria pollutants and GHGs. Examples of possible
BARCT/All Feasible Measures combustion controls include:

Optimization study and implementation.

Post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program with Declining Caps
This measure would extend the existing Cap-and-Trade Program post-2020. The
program is up and running and has a four-year-long record of auctions and successful
compliance. In the face of a growing economy, dry winters, and the closing of a nuclear
plant, it is delivering GHG reductions. This is not to say, by any means, that California
should continue on this road simply because the Cap-and-Trade Program is already in
place. Far from it, the analyses in this chapter, and the economic analysis in Chapter Ill,
clearly demonstrate that the most secure, reliable, and feasible clean energy future for
California—one that will continue to provide crucial investments to improve the quality of
life and the environment in disadvantaged communities— partially lies in extending the
Cap-and-Trade Program through to 2030.
Under this measure, funds would also continue to be deposited into the Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to support projects that fulfill the goals of AB 32.
Investment of the Cap-and-Trade Program proceeds furthers the goals of AB 32 by
reducing GHG emissions, providing net GHG sequestration, providing co-benefits,
investing in disadvantaged communities and low-income communities, and supporting
the long-term, transformative efforts needed to improve public and environmental health
and develop a clean energy economy. These investments support programs and
projects that deliver major economic, environmental, and public health benefits for
Californians, including meaningful benefits to the most disadvantaged communities.
Investments are providing a multitude of benefits to disadvantaged communities

costs, access to cleaner vehicles, improved mobility options and air quality, job creation,
energy and water savings, and greener and more vibrant communities.
Further, the Cap-and-Trade Program is designed to protect electricity and natural gas
residential ratepayers from higher energy prices. The program includes a mechanism
for electricity and natural gas utilities to auction their freely allocated allowances, with
the auction proceeds being returned to residential ratepayers as a Climate Credit. The
Climate Credit is a twice-annual bill credit given to all investor-owned utility and natural
gas utility residential customers. The total value of the Climate Credit for just vintage
2013 auction allowances was over $400 million. The first of these credits appeared on
customer bills in April 2014.52
Under this measure, the State would preserve its current linkages and supports future
linkages with other jurisdictions, thus facilitating international action to address climate
change. The high compliance rates with the Cap-and-Trade Program also demonstrate
that the infrastructure and implementation features of the program are effective and
understood by the regulated community. This measure also lends itself to integration
with the Clean Power Plan requirements and is flexible to allow expansion to other
sectors or regions.
While GHG reductions will occur at covered entities under the current design of the
Cap-and-Trade Program, CARB has begun the process to evaluate potential changes
to program design features that would support greater direct GHG emissions reductions
at Cap-and-Trade Program covered entities. These potential program design changes
would need to be further evaluated for economic impacts, coordinated with linked
partners, and be part of a future rulemaking. The areas to be evaluated include, but are
not limited to the following:




52

Reducing the offset usage limit. Offset use is currently limited to 8 percent of
each covered entity’s compliance obligation.
Redesigning the allocation strategy to reduce free allocation at a rate to support
increased technology and energy investment at covered entities to reduce GHG
emissions.
Reducing allocation if the covered entity increases criteria or toxics emissions
over some baseline.

The Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario represents an expected case where current and
proposed GHG reduction policies and measures begin as expected and perform as
expected, and technology is readily available and deployed on schedule. The GHG
reductions with the Uncertainty Scenario represent uncertainty surrounding measure
performance. This uncertainty was modeled by assumptions around the ability of the
measure to achieve its full estimated potential GHG reductions as provided in the
modeled scenario. Measures set in statute, like the 50 percent RPS, are more certain
to achieve anticipated, or very close to anticipated, results. Other measures for which
no policy mechanism has yet been designed, such as the 20 percent reduction in
refinery emissions, may result in more, or fewer, reductions than anticipated, depending
on how such a regulation is ultimately designed. Emissions ranges were created for

41

each measure based on the CARB staff’s assessment of reduction uncertainty and
stakeholder input.
The uncertainty analysis is conservative in that it assumes measures may achieve
fewer reductions, but not greater reductions. The two bars in Figure II-2 represent a
range of potential cumulative reductions between 2021 and 2030. An important
strength of the Cap-and-Trade Program is that it scales up or down within the overall
strategy depending on how the other measures perform. In the Proposed Scoping Plan
Scenario, the Cap-and-Trade Program would need to deliver approximately
191 MMTCO2e net savings of the 680 MMTCO2e, which would account for about 28
percent of the total reductions between 2021 and 2030. In the Uncertainty Scenario,
California still meets its target, even though the direct measures do not meet their
predicted effectiveness, because the Cap-and-Trade Program makes up the difference.
Another way to look at this scenario is to understand the trajectory of GHG reductions
over time, relative to the 2030 target. Figure ll-3 provides the trajectory of GHG
emissions modeled for the proposed strategy.

Figure II-3 shows the Reference scenario (blue) and the version of the Proposed
Scoping Plan Scenario that excludes the Cap-and-Trade Program (green). Between
the periods of 2020 and about 2025, the measures in the Proposed Scoping Plan
Scenario constrain GHG emissions below the dotted straight line. After 2025, GHG
emissions continue to fall, but at a slower rate than needed to meet the 2030 target. It
is the Cap-and-Trade Program that will constrain the emissions to the necessary levels
42

to achieve the 2030 target. In this scenario, it is estimated that the known commitments
and the refinery measure will result in an emissions level of about 305 MMTCO2e in
2030. Thus, for the proposed scenario, the Cap-and-Trade Program would deliver
about 45 MMTCO2e in 2030 and ensure the 2030 target is achieved.
To understand how the Proposed Plan affects the main economic sectors, Table ll-3
provides estimated GHG emissions by sector, compared to 1990 levels, and the range
of GHG emissions for each sector estimated for 2030. This comparison helps to
illustrate which sectors are reducing emissions more than others and where to focus
additional actions to reduce GHGs across the entire economy.

*Work is underway through 2017 to estimate the range of potential sequestration benefits from the
natural and working lands sector.

The sector ranges may change in response to how the sectors respond to the Cap-andTrade Program. While the known commitments will deliver some reductions in each
sector, the Cap-and-Trade Program will deliver additional reductions in the sectors it
covers. Annual GHG reporting and the GHG inventory will track annual changes in
emissions, and those will provide ongoing assessments of how each sector is reducing
emissions due to the full complement of known commitments, refinery measure, and the
Cap-and-Trade Program, as applicable.

B.

Scenario Modeling

There are a variety of models that can be used to model GHG emissions. For this plan,
the State is using the PATHWAYS model.53 PATHWAYS is structured to model GHG
emissions while recognizing the integrated nature of the industrial economic and energy
sectors. For example, if the transportation sector adds more electric vehicles,
PATHWAYS responds to reflect an energy demand increase in the electricity sector.
However, PATHWAYS does not reflect any change in transportation infrastructure and
land use demand associated with additional ZEVs on the road. The ability to capture a
subset of interactive effects of policies and measures helps to provide a representation
of the interconnected nature of the system and impacts to GHGs.
At this time, PATHWAYS does not include a module for natural and working lands. As
such, PATHWAYS cannot be used to model the natural and working lands sector, the
interactive effects of polices aimed at the economic and energy sectors and their effect
on land use or conditions, or the interactive effects of polices aimed at the natural
environment and their impact on the economic and energy sectors. For this plan,
external inputs had to be developed for PATHWAYS to supply biofuel volumes. The
natural and working lands sector is also being modeled separately as described in
Chapter lV, Section D. CARB and other State agencies will work to integrate all the
sectors into one model to fully capture interactive effects across both the natural and
built environments before the next Scoping Plan update.
Lastly, the PATHWAYS assumptions and results in this plan show the significant action
that the State must take to reach its GHG reduction goals. It is important to note that
the modeling assumptions may differ from other models used by other State agencies.
Modeling exercises undertaken in future regulatory proceedings may result in different
measures, programs, and program results than those used in the modeling for this
Scoping Plan. State agencies will engage on their specific policies and measure
development processes separately from CARB Scoping Plan activities, in public forums
to engage all stakeholders.
Uncertainty
Several types of uncertainty are important to understand in both forecasting future
emissions and estimating the benefits of emission reduction packages. In developing
the Proposed Plan, we have forecast a Reference scenario and estimated the GHG
emissions outcome of the Proposed Plan using PATHWAYS. Inherent in the Reference
scenario modeling is the expectation that many of the existing programs will continue in
their current form, and the expected drivers for GHG emissions such as energy
demand, population growth, and economic growth will match our current projections.
However, it is unlikely that the future will precisely match our projections, leading to
uncertainty in the forecast. Thus, the single “reference” line should be understood to
represent one possible future in a range of possible predictions. For the Proposed
Scoping Plan Scenario, PATHWAYS utilized inputs that are assumptions external to the
model. PATHWAYS was provided plausible inputs such as energy demand over time,
53

ARB. 2016. AB 32 Scoping Plan Public Workshops. www.arb.ca.gov/cc/scopingplan/meetings/meetings.htm

44

the start years for specific policies, and the penetration rates of associated
technologies. Each of the assumptions provided to PATHWAYS has some uncertainty,
which is also reflected in the results. Thus, while the results presented in the Proposed
Plan may seem precise due to the need for precision in model inputs, these results are
estimates, and the use of ranges in some of the results is meant to capture that
uncertainty.
Further, as noted in the November 7, 2016, 2030 Target Scoping Plan Workshop, “All
policies have a degree of uncertainty associated with them.”54 As this Proposed Plan is
meant to chart a path to achieving the 2030 target, additional work will be required to
fully design and implement any policies identified in this plan. During the subsequent
development of policies, CARB and other State agencies will learn more about
technologies, cost, and how each industry works as a more comprehensive evaluation
is conducted in coordination with stakeholders. Thus, the actual reductions may be
different than what is estimated as part of this plan’s modeling. Given the uncertainty
around assumptions used in modeling, and performance uncertainty as specific policies
are fully designed and implemented, estimates associated with the Proposed Scoping
Plan Scenario are certain to be different than what is actually implemented. One way to
mitigate for this risk is to develop policies that can adapt and increase certainty in GHG
emissions reductions. Periodic reviews of progress toward achieving the 2030 target
and performance of specific policies also provide opportunities for the State to consider
any changes to ensure we remain on course to achieve the 2030 target. The need for
this periodic review process was anticipated in AB 32, as it calls for updates to the
Scoping Plan at least once every five years.
C.

Policy Analysis of Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario

The following are key criteria that were considered while evaluating potential policies
beyond the known commitments. Also, the results of the economic analysis (presented
in Chapter III) were important in the design of the plan.






Ensure the State achieves the 2030 target. The strategy must ensure that
GHG emissions reductions occur and are sufficient to achieve the 2030 target.
Provide air quality co-benefits. An important concern for environmental justice
communities is for any Proposed Plan to achieve air quality co-benefits.
Prioritize Rules and Regulations for Direct GHG Reductions. Requires
CARB in developing this Scoping Plan to prioritize emission reduction rules and
regulations that result in direct emission reductions at large stationary sources of
GHG emissions sources and direct emission reductions from mobile sources.
Provide potential to protect against emissions leakage. Require any policies
to achieve the statewide limits to minimize emissions leakage to the extent
possible. Emissions leakage can occur when production moves out-of-state, so
there appears to be a reduction in California’s emissions, but the production and



emissions have just moved elsewhere. This loss in production may be
associated with loss in jobs and decreases in the State’s gross domestic product
(GDP) and could potentially increase global GHG emissions if the production
moves to a less efficient facility outside of California.
Develop greenhouse gas reduction programs that can be readily exported
to other jurisdictions. Currently, California’s Cap-and-Trade Program is linked
with Québec’s program and is proposing to link with Ontario’s cap-and-trade
program. At the same time, California’s ambitious policies such as the RPS and
LCFS have resulted in other regions adopting similar programs.
Invest in disadvantaged and low-lncome communities, and low-income
households. Currently, Cap-and-Trade auction proceeds from the sale of Stateowned allowances are appropriated for a variety of programs to reduce GHGs,
which lead to job creation and economic development. A minimum of 35 percent
of the proceeds are to be invested in projects to benefit disadvantaged
communities, low-income communities, and low-income households. It is
important to understand if the strategy will require or result in funding to support
GHG reductions.
Avoid or minimize the impacts of climate change on public health by
continuing reductions in GHGs. Climate change has the potential to
significantly impact public health, including increases in heat illness and death,
air pollution-related exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,
injury and loss of life due to severe storms and flooding, increased vector-borne
and water-borne diseases, and stress and mental trauma due to extreme
weather-related catastrophes.
Provide compliance flexibility. Flexibility is important as it allows each
regulated entity the ability to pursue its own path toward compliance in a way that
works best for its business model. Flexibility also acknowledges that regulatory
agencies may not have a complete picture of all available low-cost compliance
mechanisms or opportunities even across the same sector. In addition, under
AB 32 and AB 197, the strategy to reduce GHGs requires consideration of costeffectiveness, which compliance flexibility provides.
Support the Clean Power Plan and other federal climate programs. The
Clean Power Plan is the most prominent federal climate regulation applicable to
stationary sources, and California will continue to support aggressive federal
action, as well as to defend existing programs like the Clean Power Plan.
California power plants are expected to be within their limits as set forth by the
State’s draft compliance plan. However, the State still needs a mechanism to
ensure the emissions for the covered electricity generating plants do not exceed
the federal limits. This mechanism must be federally enforceable with regard to
the affected power plants, and limit their emissions in accordance with the federal
limit.

Table ll-4 provides an assessment of the Proposed Plan compared to the criteria
provided above, while listing which specific policies and measures help to meet the
criteria. This assessment is based on CARB staff evaluation as well as the analyses
described in Chapter lll.

Evaluation of Scoping Plan Alternatives

During the development of the Proposed Plan, stakeholders suggested alternative
scenarios to achieve the 2030 target. While countless scenarios could potentially be
developed and evaluated, the four below were considered, as they were most often
included in comments by stakeholders and they bracket the range of potential
scenarios. Several of these alternative scenarios were also evaluated in the Initial
AB 32 Scoping Plan in 2008 (All Regulations, Carbon Tax).55 Since the adoption of the
Initial AB 32 Scoping Plan, some of the alternative scenarios have been implemented or
contemplated by other jurisdictions, which has helped in the analysis and the
development of this plan. This section provides a description and assessment of the
alternatives against the policy criteria provided above. These assessments are based
on CARB staff’s evaluation and the analyses in Chapter lll.
1.

Alternative 1: No Cap-and-Trade

Alternative 1 includes the known commitments described in Section A of this chapter
plus a 30 percent reduction in GHG emissions in the refinery sector, but it does not
include a post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program. To achieve the 2030 target without the
Cap-and-Trade Program, significant additional actions beyond the known commitments
would have to be put in place to achieve the 2030 target, many of which may currently
have implementation barriers. For example, the RPS target of 50 percent would need
to be increased to 60 percent or greater, and incentive programs would need statutory
authority.
The enhancements to the known commitments and new policies and measures are
illustrative of the additional type of action that would be needed in this alternative in the
absence of a Cap-and-Trade Program, but they are not necessarily the exact suite of
policies or measures that would be selected in the absence of a Cap-and-Trade
Program. It is important to note that many of the specific polices and measures
included in the modeling for this scenario may have technology, cost, or statutory
barriers that may prevent implementation from occurring at this time. The modeled
scenario for this alternative provides an illustrative example of how a No Cap-and-Trade
alternative could be structured. Additional details of the modeling for this alternative are
included in Appendix D. The bullets below summarize additional actions needed
beyond the proposed strategy without a cap-and-trade program:





Enhanced RPS, energy efficiency, LCFS, and refinery measure.
New GHG prescriptive regulations for industry requiring a 25 percent reduction in
the sector by 2030.
Enhanced GHG prescriptive regulations for refineries requiring a 30 percent
reduction in the sector by 2030.
A low-emission diesel standard.





Additional deployment of ZEVs.
Incentive programs for early retirement of vehicles and heating, ventilation, and
air conditioning systems.
Increased VMT reductions.
Increased electrification of the residential sector.
Increased utilization of renewable natural gas.

Alternative 1 demonstrates the suite of specific measures and regulations that would
need to be designed and implemented to achieve the 2030 target without the Cap-andTrade Program, including establishing new incentive programs for early replacement of
vehicles and other equipment. The modeling also assumes that all the policies and
measures could be implemented and would perform as expected, which is highly
uncertain. Many of the measures in this alternative face technology and cost barriers
that must be overcome to ensure the reductions begin as soon as possible. If any
measures are unable to be implemented or fail to perform, as needed, new measures
would need to be identified, designed, and implemented. The time required to design
and implement new measures could impede the State’s ability to achieve its 2030
target. The modeling for the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario already acknowledges
some uncertainty for the known commitments; any enhancements called for in this
alternative to these policies and measures would further increase the uncertainty of their
ability to achieve the required GHG reductions. This alternative would require additional
statutory authority and funding to implement the incentive programs. No funding would
be generated for GGRF programs, including those in disadvantaged communities.
While this alternative could also support air quality co-benefits and public health cobenefits, it has fewer options for mitigating emissions leakage, limited opportunities for
linkages, and limited compliance flexibility. This alternative would not generate any
funds for GGRF programs. Under Alternative 1, the State would also need to identify a
new mechanism to demonstrate compliance with the Clean Power Plan.
2.

Alternative 2: Carbon Tax

Alternative 2 includes the known commitments described in Section A of this chapter,
the 20 percent reduction in GHG emissions at refineries, and a carbon tax in lieu of the
post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program.
A cap-and-trade program and a carbon tax are both carbon pricing mechanisms, but
there are important differences. A cap-and-trade program sets an emission cap so that
the maximum allowable GHG emission level is known and covered entities will have to
reduce GHG emissions. With a carbon tax, there is no mechanism to limit the actual
amount of GHG emissions either at a single source or in the aggregate, and a carbon
tax requires entities to pay for all of their GHG emissions directly to the State. In other
words, a cap-and-trade program provides environmental certainty while a carbon tax
provides some carbon price certainty. There is no emissions limit with a carbon tax.
Alternative 2 only achieves the 2030 GHG target if we set the right price—a difficult task
to do. A set carbon tax may not actually represent the actual cost of control for the
50

covered sectors. If we set the price too high, we have made the program unnecessarily
expensive, and if we set the price too low, we will not achieve enough GHG reductions
to meet the target. An approach to better ensure the GHG target is met is through a
flexible tax that can be adjusted annually as part of the GHG emission inventory
process. If the emission reductions are insufficient, the tax would be increased the
following year to induce the needed GHG reductions. However, this approach is
complex and is at odds with the carbon price certainty that many have advocated for as
part of a carbon tax option.
This alternative would provide compliance flexibility, as it does not mandate specific
actions, and it provides a funding source that could be used to fund GGRF programs or
other programs. Moreover, this alternative could provide air-quality benefits, public
health benefits, and direct emission reductions if the carbon tax is set appropriately to
reduce GHGs. However, there is no obvious way to address trade exposure and to
protect against emissions leakage as required under AB 32. One potential strategy to
mitigate emissions leakage may be to exempt trade-exposed sectors from the carbon
tax, but that would shift the burden to the sectors still subject to the tax and would pick
“winners” across sectors as some industries may face a carbon cost and others may
not. Any such exemptions would need to consider the role any exempt sector is
expected to play in the long run, as supporting high carbon intensive or fossil fuel
industry may not align well with the State’s long-term climate goals. Alternative 2 would
also forgo any existing and future linkages along the lines of those that exist with the
current Cap-and-Trade Program. The State also would need to identify a new
mechanism to comply with the Clean Power Plan.
In addition, information is emerging regarding the efficacy of the carbon tax policy in
British Columbia (BC), which has a jurisdictional goal of reducing its GHG emissions by
at least 33 percent below 2007 levels by 2020.56 British Columbia’s current carbon tax is
$30 CAD per metric ton of carbon. It has not increased since 2012, and BC’s emissions
have increased by 2.7 percent from 2011 through 2014.57 A report provided to the BC
government by the Climate Action Leadership team found the province will fail to meet
its 2020 target.58,59 A progress report issued by the BC government stated, “Some
policies lose effectiveness over time if they are not updated. For example, the carbon
tax impact effectively diminishes if the rate remains unchanged, as inflation dampens
the price signal.”60 This highlights the importance of how a carbon tax value is set and
may need to change over time, and introduces the potential for some uncertainty
around political support for higher carbon tax values. And, if data come to light that
such an existing carbon tax is not working to achieve the State’s climate goals,

additional policies, such as prescriptive regulations, may need to be introduced, and
they may need to be aggressive to make up for the time when reductions did not
materialize as expected.
3.

Alternative 3: All Cap-and-Trade

Alternative 3 is a variant of the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario and would rely more
heavily on the Cap-and-Trade Regulation. However, since the majority of this scenario
is comprised of actions under the known commitments, with several in response to
statutory requirements, there are only a limited number of policies and measures that
can be removed. Alternative 3 is the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario minus the
20 percent refinery sector measure and maintaining the LCFS stringency at a
10 percent reduction in carbon intensity through 2030.
This alternative meets the criteria outlined in Section C of this chapter similar to the staff
proposal, with one exception. This alternative is not as responsive to the direction in AB
197, as it does not prioritize direct GHG reductions at large stationary sources. It may
also limit progress in developing low carbon fuels, which will be needed in increasing
quantities to meet 2030 and 2050 climate goals.
4.

Alternative 4: Cap-and-Tax

Alternative 4 is a variant of Alternative 2 (Carbon Tax) with some features from the
Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario. This alternative is designed to cap GHG emissions
and incorporate carbon pricing through a tax. This alternative is structured to be the
same as Alternative 2 with known commitments and a 20 percent refinery sector
measure. Under this alternative, entities that would be covered by a post-2020 Capand-Trade Program would instead have an annual cap that declines each year from
2021 to 2030 for each covered entity. Each year, these entities would be required to
reduce their emissions by the established annual cap decline and pay a tax to the State
for each metric ton of GHGs they emit that year. There would be no trading mechanism
in this alternative. This mechanism would be expected to deliver 191 MMTCO2e
cumulative GHG emission reductions. Or, 221 MMTCO2e if the refinery measure is
combined with the shortfall of 191 MMTCO2e and all stationary facilities currently under
the cap are part of this policy.
The modeling for Alternative 1 provides some insights into the potential design elements
for this alternative. Modeling for Alternative 1 already assumes a 30 percent reduction
in the refinery sector by 2030, or annual cap decline of 3 percent. And, the modeling
assumes a 25 percent reduction in the industrial and oil and gas sectors, or 2.5 percent
cap decline between 2021 and 2030. Alternative 1 also includes enhancements to
some known commitments that may not be feasible to achieve. Holding the known
commitments to the stringency in the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario would require
the annual cap decline in the refinery, industrial, and oil and gas sectors to be increased
beyond the 3 and 2.5 percent, respectively. Further, this alternative would not rely on a
carbon price signal to drive the GHG reductions; rather, the carbon tax may functionally
act as a payment for every metric ton of GHGs emitted, and the cap may be the actual
52

constraint on emissions. Without a trading mechanism, compliance flexibility is
reduced. To this point, the state of Washington has adopted its Clean Air Rule that
caps and requires reductions at their covered entities.61 But, in the design of the rule, it
became clear that not all covered entities could achieve the annual reductions of
approximately 2 percent (lower cap decline than what California would need), and an
offset and limited trading mechanism were added to the rule to provide compliance
flexibility.
Under Alternative 4, direct GHG emissions reductions would occur at each covered
entity and this alternative would provide a funding source for other actions, including
climate investments in disadvantaged communities. By including a declining cap, GHG
emissions reductions toward achieving the State’s target are more certain if other
measures deliver the anticipated reductions. This also may not be the most costeffective way to meet the State’s climate goals. This alternative would introduce two
costs—(1) onsite investments for reductions at a higher cost or reductions in production,
and (2) a carbon tax for actual emissions paid to the State—that must be absorbed by
the covered entity or passed on to consumers. In the Cap-and-Trade Program, some
allowances can be provided to help reduce the cost-pass through to consumers that
may otherwise make the industry less competitive with other producers not subject to a
carbon cost. Further, some sources may not be able to achieve a required percent
reduction in GHGs each year, forcing them to cut production to meet their annual caps,
potentially affecting jobs and the price of their products. This would negatively impact
both the California economy and global GHG emissions. Goods that are currently
produced in California would be produced elsewhere potentially reducing in-state
employment. Assuming California residents still want buy these products, they would
be produced out-of-state and imported in, potentially increasing GHG emissions. Under
Alternative 4, there are limited mechanisms to address emissions leakage, which may
increase under this scenario.
Developing such a program would require several years to design, as each large
economic sector (energy, transportation, and industry) may need to have different
annual reduction percentages based on the ability for that sector to achieve those
reductions while minimizing for emissions leakage and avoiding high costs to
consumers. Even within the industrial sector, there will need to be careful consideration
of annual percentage reductions among industry. The Cap-and-Trade Program
currently distinguishes between over 30 industrial sectors for purposes of free
allowance allocation and minimizing emissions leakage. There would also be a need
for extensive regulatory efforts to ensure that, without a hard cap on aggregate
emissions, a host of separate facilities and sources achieve enough reductions to meet
the 2030 target. This scenario may also result in fewer opportunities for linkages with
subnational or national programs, since other jurisdictions have not adopted these types
of programs. There would still be a need to identify a backstop measure under the
Clean Power Plan if the power plants were not able to achieve the required reductions
each year as identified in the State’s compliance plan.

Evaluations
A.

Existing Programs for Air Quality Improvement in California

For half a century, CARB has been a leader in measuring, evaluating, and reducing
sources of air pollution. Its air pollution programs have been adapted for national
programs and emulated in other countries. Significant progress has been made in
reducing diesel particulate matter (PM) and many other hazardous air pollutants. CARB
partners with air districts to address stationary emissions sources and adopts and
implements State-level regulations to address sources of criteria and toxic air pollution,
including mobile sources. The key air quality strategies being implemented by CARB
include the following:









State Implementation Plans.62 Strategy and proposed control measures
designed to achieve the emission reductions from mobile sources, fuels,
stationary sources, and consumer products necessary to meet ozone and fine
PM attainment deadlines established by the Clean Air Act.
Diesel Risk Reduction Plan.63 The plan recommends many control measures to
reduce the risks associated with diesel PM and achieve a goal of 85 percent PM
reduction by 2020. Diesel PM accounts for approximately 60 percent of the
current estimated inhalation cancer risk for background ambient air. 64
Sustainable Freight Action Plan.65 Strategy to improve freight efficiency,
transition to zero emission technologies, and increase competitiveness of
California’s freight system.
AB 32 Scoping Plan.66 Comprehensive strategy to achieve the State’s climate
goals.
AB 1807.67 CARB is required to use certain criteria in prioritizing the identification
and control of air toxics.
AB 2588 Air Toxics “Hot Spots” Program.68 The goals of the program are to
collect emission data, identify facilities having localized impacts, ascertain health
risks, notify nearby residents of significant risks, and to reduce those significant
risks to acceptable levels.

To support efforts to advance the State’s toxics program, the Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) finalized a new health risk assessment
methodology on March 6, 2015. 69 In light of this update, CARB is collaborating with air
districts in the review of the existing toxics program under AB 2588 to strengthen the
program.

While the efforts to date have made a large impact on criteria and toxic emissions, and
emissions are expected to continue to decline, more needs to be done to achieve
healthful air and reduce community exposure to air pollution, especially in
disadvantaged communities. To that end, California is pursuing a multipronged
approach to reduce air pollution and address community exposure. In addition to
continuing the many programs and policies to improve air quality, the following efforts
are critical to addressing the disadvantaged community concerns:









Take additional action to reduce industrial source emissions, with a focus on
near-source exposure through CARB and air district actions.
Integrate emissions and program data for toxics, criteria pollutants, and GHGs.
Develop direct State measures that address each of these emissions sources,
such as the Mobile Source Strategy and Sustainable Freight Action Plan.
Implement Adaptive Management to monitor for and address any unlikely
increases in toxic or criteria pollutant emissions due to implementation of the
Cap-and-Trade Program.
Work with air districts to assess emission reduction opportunities.
Continue the toxics review process underway in response to OEHHA’s risk
methodology update.
Continue implementation and enforcement of diesel risk reduction measures.
Improve emissions inventory and data transparency.
B.

AB 197 Measure Analyses

This section provides the required AB 197 estimates for the measures evaluated in this
Proposed Plan. These estimates provide information on the relative impacts of the
evaluated measures when compared to each other. Understanding if a measure will
increase or reduce criteria pollutants or toxic air contaminant emissions, or if increasing
stringency at additional costs yields few additional GHG reductions, supports the design
of a suite of policies that result in GHG reductions, air quality co-benefits, and costeffective measures. To this end, AB 197 (Garcia, Chapter 250, Statutes of 2016)
requires the following for each potential reduction measure evaluated in any scoping
plan update:




The range of projected GHG emissions reductions that result from the measure.
The range of projected air pollution reductions that result from the measure.
The cost-effectiveness, including avoided social costs, of the measure.

The next three sub-sections provide the required AB 197 estimates for the measures
evaluated in this Proposed Plan. As the Proposed Plan was developed, it was
important to understand if any of the proposed policies or measures would increase
criteria pollutant or toxic air contaminant emissions. Note the important caveats around
some of the estimates; they must be considered when using the information in the
tables below for purposes other than as intended.

55

1.

Estimated Emissions Reductions for Evaluated Measures

For many of the existing programs with known commitments, such as the Mobile Source
Strategy, previous analyses provide emission factors or other methods for estimating
the impacts required by AB 197. Where available, these values were used. In some
cases, estimates are based on data from other sources, such as the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) Renewables Portfolio Standard Calculator. For newly
proposed measures, such as the refinery measures, assumptions were required to
estimate the values. Consequently, the estimates for the newly proposed measures
have substantial uncertainty. The uncertainty in the impacts of these measures would
be reduced as the measures are defined in greater detail during the regulatory
processes that are undertaken to define and adopt the programs. For example, as a
measure is developed in detail, ways to obtain additional co-pollutant reductions or
avoid co-pollutant increases may be identified and evaluated.
Table Ill-1 provides the estimates for the measures evaluated during the development of
the Proposed Plan. Based on the estimates below, the Proposed Plan will provide air
quality benefits. The table also provides important context, limitations, and caveats
about the values.
As shown, the table includes GHG, criteria pollutant, and diesel PM estimates. As
mentioned above, diesel PM accounts for 60 percent of the current estimated inhalation
cancer risk for background ambient air. CARB is evaluating which additional toxic air
contaminants can be estimated for the potential measures below.

56

Table Ill-1. Ranges of Estimated GHG and Air Pollution Reductions by
Policy or Measure in 2030
Important: These estimates assume a 1:1 relationship between changes in GHGs, criteria pollutants, and toxic air
contaminant emissions, and it is unclear whether that is always the case. The values should not be considered
estimates of absolute changes for other analytical purposes. The ranges are estimates that represent current
assumptions of how programs may be implemented; actual impacts may vary depending on the design,
implementation, and performance of the policies and measures. The table does not show interactions between
measures, such as the relationship with increased transportation electrification and associated increase in energy
demand for the electricity sector. The measures in bold are included in the Proposed Plan.

— CARB is evaluating how to best estimate these values.
Criteria and toxic values are shown in tons per day, as they are episodic emissions events with residence times of a
few hours to days, unlike GHGs, which have atmospheric residence times of many decades.
A. Due to the inherent flexibility of the Cap-and-Trade Regulation, as well as the overlay of other complementary
GHG reduction measures, the mix of compliance strategies that individual facilities may use is not known. However,
based on current law and policies that control industrial and electricity generating sources of air pollution, and
expected compliance responses, CARB believes that emissions increases at the statewide, regional, or local level
due to the regulation are not likely. A more stringent post-2020 cap-and-trade program will provide an incentive for
covered facilities to decrease GHG emissions and any related emissions of criteria and toxic pollutants. Please see
CARB’s Co-Pollutant Emissions Assessment for a more detailed evaluation of a cap-and-trade program and
associated air emissions impacts: https://www.arb.ca.gov/regact/2010/capandtrade10/capv6appp.pdf
B. A carbon tax has the same inherent flexibility of a cap-and-trade program, with the distinction that without a cap,
a carbon tax option may not result in any emissions reductions for GHGs or other air emissions. If a carbon tax
resulted in the same amount of GHG reductions as the cap-and-trade measure, we would expect similar types of
compliance responses and similar impacts to criteria and toxics emissions.
NOx = nitrogen oxides; VOC = volatile organic compound

2.

Estimated Economic Benefits for Evaluated Measures

Consideration of the social costs of carbon is a requirement in AB 197, including
evaluation of cost-effectiveness for measures within this Proposed Plan. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) describes the social costs of carbon as
follows:
EPA and other federal agencies use the social cost of carbon (SC-CO2) to
estimate the climate benefits of rulemakings. The SC-CO2 is an estimate of the
economic damages associated with a small increase in carbon dioxide (CO 2)
emissions, conventionally one metric ton, in a given year. This dollar figure also
represents the value of damages avoided for a small emission reduction (i.e., the
benefit of a CO2 reduction).
The SC-CO2 is meant to be a comprehensive estimate of climate change
damages and includes, among other things, changes in net agricultural
productivity, human health, property damages from increased flood risk and
changes in energy system costs, such as reduced costs for heating and
increased costs for air conditioning. However, it does not currently include all
important damages. The IPCC Fifth Assessment report observed that SC-CO2
estimates omit various impacts that would likely increase damages. The models
used to develop SC-CO2 estimates do not currently include all of the important
physical, ecological, and economic impacts of climate change recognized in the
climate change literature because of a lack of precise information on the nature
of damages and because the science incorporated into these models naturally
lags behind the most recent research. Nonetheless, the SC-CO2 is a useful
measure to assess the benefits of CO2 reductions.70
There continues to be active discussion within government and academia about the role
of SC-CO2 in assessing regulations, quantifying avoided climate damages, and the
monetizing values themselves. To date, federal agencies such as the U.S. EPA,
Department of Energy, and Department of Transportation have used SC-CO2 in
evaluating regulations.
The IPCC has stated that SC-CO2 estimates are likely underestimated due to the
omission of significant impacts that cannot be accurately monetized.71 In addition, the
SC-CO2 does not account for impacts related to changes in criteria pollutants or toxics
resulting from GHG focused policies and programs.
The cost-effectiveness of regulations and policies represents the cost to control each
unit of emissions, and is the traditional cost metric associated with emission control.

SC-CO2 allows California to begin to examine a different metric, the costs of no action,
or the damages.
There may be technologies or policies that do not appear to be cost-effective when
compared to the SC-CO2 associated with the avoided GHG reductions. However, these
actions may result in other benefits that are not reflected in the SC-CO2, including
diversification of the portfolio of transportation fuels (a goal outlined in the Low Carbon
Fuel Standard) and reductions in criteria pollutant emissions from power plants (as in
the Renewables Portfolio Standard). Regulatory mandates help to broaden the
deployment of these technologies and address market failures. Policies may also
reduce the cost of production and utilization of lower carbon technologies over time,
helping the State achieve its climate goals and potentially providing other economic
benefits such as clean economy jobs.
This Proposed Plan uses the SC-CO2 to incorporate the concept of the avoided cost of
economic damages due to climate change—including a range for the economic benefits
that occur as a result of the avoided environmental damages that result from achieving
the 2030 target. The State will continue to monitor and engage in discussions related to
any updates to U.S. EPA’s SC-CO2 methods and values and initiate its own work to
refine a SC-CO2 method and values for California.
Table Ill-2 provides the ranges for the avoided value of economic damages in the year
2030. The U.S. EPA SC-CO2 values in 2030 of $16 using the 5 percent discount rate,
$50 using the 3 percent discount rate, and $73 using the 2.5 percent discount rate were
translated into 2015 dollars and multiplied across the range of estimated reductions by
measure in 2030 to estimate the value of climate benefits from each measure in that
year.72 Since all the measures are aimed at reducing GHGs, they all result in avoided
economic damages. The Proposed Plan is a suite of policies developed to reduce
GHGs to a specific level in 2030, and any alternative scenario that also achieves the
2030 target will have the same avoided economic damages for the single year 2030,
which is equivalent to $7.6 billion using the 3 percent discount rate, and ranges from
$2.4 to $11.0 billion using the 2.5 to 5 percent discount rates.

72

The U.S. EPA SC-CO2 values are in 2007 dollars. In 2015 dollars, $16, $50, and $73 in 2007 translates to about $18, $57, and
$83, respectively, based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI Inflation Calculator.

3.

Estimated Cost Per Metric Ton by Measure

AB 197 also requires an estimation of the cost-effectiveness of the potential measures
evaluated for the Proposed Plan. The values provided in Table Ill-3 are estimates of the
cost per metric ton of estimated reductions for each measure in 2030. These estimates
do not reflect the costs or GHG reductions of measures across all years, but focus
solely on 2030. Depending on the measure, there will be costs or savings per metric
ton of GHGs reduced. The costs represent the incremental costs to achieve the GHG
reductions beyond the Reference scenario (BAU). While it is important to understand
the relative cost effectiveness of measures in the table below, the economic analysis
presented later in this chapter provides a more comprehensive analysis of how the
Proposed Plan and alternative scenarios affect the State’s economy and jobs.
CARB will expand this analysis to include an evaluation of the cost per metric ton based
on the net present value of the cumulative GHG emissions reductions and costs for
each potential measure from 2021 through 2050, in order to capture the fuel and GHG
savings over the full economic lifetime of investments made to meet the 2030 GHG
goal.
Table lll-3 presents one way of estimating the cost (or savings) per tonne of CO2e
reduced for each of the measures in the Proposed Scoping Plan Scenario and the
Alternative 1 scenario. The measures selected reflect many factors beyond the cost per
tonne of an individual measure, including existing laws and policies, implementation
feasibility, fuel diversity and technology transformation goals, as well as health and
other benefits to California. These considerations are not reflected in the metric below.
Furthermore, many of the measures interact with other measures, making it analytically
difficult to isolate the cost and GHG savings of an individual measure. For example,
renewable electricity impacts the cost and GHG savings associated with electric
vehicles. Likewise, electric vehicles impact the value of other flexible loads to the
system, and the cost of meeting the low-carbon fuel standard directly depends on the
success of other transportation measures, just to name a few examples.
For most of the measures shown in Table lll-3, the 2030 cost per tonne metric is
isolated from the other measures by performing a series of sensitivity model runs in the
California PATHWAYS model. This cost per tonne metric is calculated as the difference
in the 2030 annualized cost (or savings) of the PATHWAYS Scoping Plan (or
Alternative 1) scenario as compared to the annualized cost of the Scoping Plan (or
Alternative 1) scenario excluding that particular measure. This cost (or savings) delta is
divided by the difference in 2030 GHG emissions in the scenario as compared to the
scenario excluding that particular measure.
By removing each measure in isolation from the rest of the measures in the scenario,
this approach results in an estimate of the annual incremental average cost (or cost
savings) per tonne of the measure, relative to the Proposed Scoping Plan (or Alterative
1) scenario.
63

Costs that represent transfers within the state, such as incentive payments for early
retirement of equipment, are not included in this California total cost metric. The cost
ranges shown below represent some of the uncertainty inherent in estimating this
metric. The details of how the ranges for each measure were estimated are described
in the footnotes below. All cost estimates have been rounded representing further
uncertainty in individual values.
It is important to note that this cost per tonne metric does not represent an expected
market price value for carbon mitigation associated with these measures. In addition,
since the table below reports a single year (2030) snap-shot of costs and savings, it
does not capture the fuel savings or GHG savings associated with the full economic
lifetime of measures that are implemented in 2030, but whose impacts extend beyond
2030, nor does it capture the climate or health benefits of the GHG mitigation measures.
For the measures where other sources beyond the PATHWAYS model are used to
develop estimates of the cost per tonne, this is noted in the table below.

64

Table Ill-3. Estimated 2030 Cost Per Metric Ton by Measure
Important: As individual measures are designed and implemented they will be subject to
further evaluation and refinement and public review, which may result in different findings
than presented below. The ranges are estimates that represent current assumptions of how
programs may be implemented and may vary greatly depending on the design,
implementation, and performance of the policies and measures. Measures in bold text are

Economic Analyses
1.

Economic Impacts

The following section outlines the economic impact of the Proposed Plan relative to the
business-as-usual Reference scenario. Additional detail on the economic analysis,
including modeling details and the estimated economic impact of alternative scenarios
is presented in Appendix E.
The Proposed Plan outlines a path to achieve the SB 32 target that requires less
reliance on fossil fuels and increased investment in low carbon fuels and clean energy
technologies. Through this shift, California can lead the world in developing the
technologies needed to reduce the global risks of climate change. Innovation in lowcarbon technologies will open growth opportunities for investors and businesses in
California. As modeled, the analysis in this 2030 Target Scoping Plan suggests that the
66

cost of transitioning to this lower carbon economy are small, even without counting the
potential opportunities for new industries and innovation in California. Under the
Proposed Plan, the California economy, employment, and personal income will continue
to grow as California businesses and consumers make clean energy investments and
improve efficiency and productivity to reduce energy costs.
Overview of Economic Modeling
Two models are used to estimate the economic impact of the Proposed Plan and
California’s continued clean energy transition: (1) the California PATHWAYS model, and
(2) the Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) Policy Insight Plus model. The
California PATHWAYS model estimates the direct costs and GHG emission reductions
of implementing the prescriptive (or non-Cap-and-Trade) measures in the Proposed
Plan relative to the BAU scenario.73 Direct costs are the sum of the incremental
changes in capital expenditures and fuel expenditures, including fuel savings for
reduced energy use from efficiency measures. In most cases, reducing GHG emissions
requires the use of more expensive equipment that can be operated using less fuel. In
the Proposed Plan, the prescriptive measures modeled in PATHWAYS account for a
portion of the GHG reductions required to meet the 2030 target. The remaining
reductions are delivered through the Cap-and-Trade Program (as outlined in
Figure III-2). The direct costs associated with the Cap-and-Trade Program are
calculated outside of PATHWAYS based on an assumed range of Cap-and-Trade
allowance prices from 2021 through 2030.
To estimate the future costs of the Proposed Plan, this economic analysis necessarily
creates a hypothetical future California that is essentially identical to today, adjusted for
currently existing climate policy as well as projected economic and population growth
through 2030. The analysis cannot predict the types of innovation that will create
efficiencies nor can it fully account for the significant economic benefits associated with
reducing emissions. Rather, the economic modeling is conducted by estimating
incremental capital and clean fuel costs of measures and assigning those costs to
certain sectors within this hypothetical future.
The macroeconomic impacts of the Proposed Plan on the California economy were
modeled using the REMI model with output from California PATHWAYS and estimated
Cap-and-Trade Program costs as inputs. Additional methodological detail is presented
in Appendix E.74
Estimated Cost of Prescriptive Measures
As described above, the Proposed Plan combines new measures addressing legislative
mandates and the extension of existing measures, including a comprehensive cap on
overall GHG emissions from the State’s largest sources of pollution. The PATHWAYS
model calculates costs and GHG emission reductions associated with the prescriptive
measures in the Proposed Plan. Changes in energy use and capital investment are
calculated in PATHWAYS and represent the estimated cost of achieving an estimated
73

The PATHWAYS modeling is described in Chapter III, and additional detail is presented in Appendix D.

50 to 70 percent of the cumulative GHG reductions required to reach the SB 32 target
between 2021 and 2030. The Cap-and-Trade Program delivers any remaining
reductions, as shown in Figure III-2.
Table III-4 outlines the cost of prescriptive measures by sector in 2030, compared to the
Reference scenario, as calculated in PATHWAYS. Estimated capital costs of
equipment are levelized over the life of the equipment using a 10 percent discount rate
and fuel costs are calculated on an annual basis.75 The costs in Table III-4 are
disaggregated into capital costs and fuel costs, which includes gasoline, diesel, biofuels,
natural gas, electricity and other fuels.76 Table III-4 assumes that all prescriptive
measures deliver anticipated GHG reductions, and does not include any uncertainty in
GHG reductions or cost.77 The impact of uncertainty in GHG reductions is explored in
more detail in Chapter III and in Appendices D and E, which include additional detail on
measure, cost, and Reference scenario uncertainty.
The prescriptive measures result in incremental capital investments of $5.1 billion per
year in 2030, but these annual capital costs are nearly offset by annual fuel savings of
$4.1 billion in 2030. The incremental net cost of prescriptive measures in the Proposed
Plan is estimated at $1 billion in 2030, which represents 0.03 percent of the California
economy in 2030. Residential and commercial sectors are anticipated to see net
savings in 2030 as the fuel savings vastly outweigh the annual capital investment.
Agriculture and transportation sectors will see a net cost increase from implementation
of the prescriptive measures. The transportation sector sees higher capital costs due to
the purchase of more efficient equipment and a reduction in fuel costs due to reduced
vehicle miles traveled, more efficient equipment, and fuel-switching from fossil to
electric fuels, relative to the Reference scenario. In the agriculture sector, capital
expenditures are due to investments in more efficient lighting and the mitigation of
agricultural methane and nitrogen oxides. Agricultural fuel costs increase due to higher
electricity and liquid biofuel costs.

Estimated Cost of the Cap-and-Trade Program
The direct cost of achieving GHG reductions through the Cap-and-Trade Program is
estimated outside of PATHWAYS. The Cap-and-Trade Program sets an economy-wide
GHG emissions cap and gives firms the flexibility to choose the lowest-cost approach to
reduce emissions. As with the prescriptive measures, the direct costs of any single
specific GHG reduction activity under the Cap-and-Trade Program is subject to a large
degree of uncertainty. However, as Cap-and-Trade allows covered entities to pursue
the reduction options that emerge as the most efficient, overall abatement costs can be
bounded by the allowance price. Covered entities should pursue reduction actions with
costs less than or equal to the allowance price. An upper bound on the compliance
costs under the Cap-and-Trade Program can be therefore be estimated by multiplying
the range of anticipated allowance prices by the anticipated GHG reductions needed (in
conjunction with the reductions achieved through the prescriptive measures) to achieve
the SB 32 target.
A large number of factors influence the allowance price, including the ease of
substitution by firms to low carbon production methods, consumer price response, the
pace of technological progress, and impacts to the price of fuel. Other policy factors
that also affect the allowance price include the return of auction proceeds from the sale
of State-owned allowances and linkage with other jurisdictions.
Flexibility allows the Cap-and-Trade allowance price to adjust to changes in supply and
demand while a firm cap ensures GHG reductions are achieved. This analysis includes
a range of allowance prices bounded by the Cap-and-Trade auction floor price (C+T
Floor Price) which represents the minimum sales price for allowances sold at auction
and the Allowance Price Containment Reserve Price (C+T Reserve Price), which
represents the price at which an additional pool of allowances is made available and is
the highest anticipated price under the Program. Table III-5 outlines the projected
allowance prices used in this analysis.

Uncertainty in the GHG reduction potential of prescriptive measures in the Proposed
Plan can affect the cost of achieving the 2030 target. The aggregate emissions cap of
the Cap-and-Trade Program ensures that the 2030 target will be met—irrespective of
the GHG emissions realized through prescriptive measures. If GHG reductions
anticipated under prescriptive measures do not materialize, the Cap-and-Trade
Program will be responsible for a larger share of the total emissions reductions. Under
that scenario, the demand for Cap-and-Trade allowances may rise, resulting in an
increase in allowance price. While the Cap-and-Trade allowance price may rise, it is
highly unlikely that it will rise above the C+T Reserve price, given the program design.
If prescriptive measures deliver anticipated GHG reductions, demand for allowances will
be low, depressing the price of allowances. However, the C+T Floor Price represents
the lowest price at which allowances can be sold at auction.
Table III-6 presents the estimated direct cost estimates for GHG reductions achieved
through the Cap-and-Trade Program in 2030. These costs represent the lower and
upper bounds of the cost of reducing GHG emissions to achieve the SB 32 target under
the Proposed Plan. The estimated direct costs range from $1.2 to $3.6 billion dollars (in
$2015), depending on the allowance price in 2030. This range highlights the allowance
price uncertainty that is a trade-off to the GHG reduction certainty provided by the Capand-Trade Program. The estimated cost of GHG reductions is calculated by multiplying
the allowance price by the GHG emission reductions required to achieve the SB 32
target.
Sensitivity Analysis
In addition to uncertainty in the Cap-and-Trade allowance price and uncertainty in the
GHG reductions achieved through the prescriptive measures, there is uncertainty in
the GHG emissions that will occur under the Reference scenario, as presented in
Figure II-1. There is also uncertainty in costs embedded within the Reference scenario
including the price of oil, other energy costs, and technology costs.
The PATHWAYS incremental cost results are also sensitive to the fossil fuel price
assumptions. Altering the fuel price trajectory in the Reference scenario directly
impacts the incremental cost of achieving GHG reductions in the Proposed Plan, as
costs are relative to the Reference scenario.

70

The PATHWAYS scenarios use fossil fuel price projections from the Annual Energy
Outlook (AEO) 2015 reference case.80 To estimate the impact of changes in future fuel
prices on the estimated incremental cost of the Proposed Plan two sensitivities were
conducted. In the low fuel price sensitivity, the AEO low oil and natural gas price case
is used to project the future cost of fuels in the Reference scenario. The cost of the
Proposed Plan, relative to the reference case, increases under these conditions, since
fuel savings are less valuable when fuel prices are low. A second sensitivity shows that
high future oil and natural gas prices (as projected in the AEO high oil price case)
reduce the net cost of the Proposed Plan, relative to the Reference scenario. This is
because avoided fuel savings are more valuable when fuel prices are high. Table III-6
outlines the costs and savings from the Proposed Plan (both prescriptive measures and
cap-and-trade) under the high and low fuel price sensitivities.
The price of oil and natural gas affects the value of fuel savings, which are estimated to
be significant using AEO reference oil and natural gas prices (presented in Table III-4).
Under the low fuel price sensitivity, the net incremental cost of prescriptive measures is
$4 billion in 2030. Under the high fuel price sensitivity, the prescriptive measures result
in net savings of $5 billion in 2030. Table III-6 also shows that these price uncertainties
are captured within the analyzed range of allowance prices. As described above,
changes in fuel prices may affect the price of Cap-and-Trade allowances, but the price
is highly unlikely to go outside the range of prices bounded by the C+T Floor Price and
C+T Reserve Price. The final column in Table III-6 presents the estimated direct cost of
the Proposed Plan, including both the prescriptive measures and a range of estimated
costs to achieve GHG reductions under the Cap-and-Trade Program for varying
projections of future fuel prices. The total cost, reflecting fuel and allowance price
uncertainty, ranges from an annual savings to California of $3.8 billion to an annual cost
of $7.6 billion. The net climate benefits, as estimated by the SC-CO2, outweigh these
direct costs.81

Fuel price sensitivity is directly modeled in PATHWAYS, resulting in a range of impacts from prescriptive measures. The range of
costs labeled “2030 Total Cost” includes the cost of prescriptive measures estimated in PATHWAYS and the impact of the Cap
and-Trade Program calculated at the C+T Floor Price (the lower bounds) and the C+T Reserve Price (the upper bounds) .

Macroeconomic Impacts
The macroeconomic impacts of the Proposed Plan are estimated using the REMI
model. Annual capital and fuel costs (for example, the costs in Table III-4) are
estimated using PATHWAYS and input into the REMI model to estimate the impact of
the Proposed Plan on the California economy each year relative to GDP, which is often
used as a proxy for economic growth, as well as employment, personal income, and
changes in output by sector and consumer spending. Table III-7 presents key
macroeconomic impacts of implementing the Proposed Plan, based on the range of
anticipated allowance prices. In 2030, under the Proposed Plan, growth across the
indicators is about one-half of one percent less than the Reference scenario. The
results in Table III-7 include not only the estimated direct cost of the Cap-and-Trade
Program, but also the return of allowance value from the auction of Cap-and-Trade
allowances to California and consumers. See Appendix E for more detail on the
modeling of the return of allowance value under the Cap-and-Trade Program in REMI.
The Cap-and-Trade Program is modeled in REMI as an increase in production cost to
sectors based on estimated future GHG emissions and anticipated free allowance
allocation. If a sector is expected to receive free allocation of allowances, the value of
those free allowances is not modeled as a cost in REMI. The analysis does include the
estimated benefit to sectors due to the proceeds from the auction of cap-and-trade
allowances and assumes that each year $2 billion of proceeds from the auction of
State-owned cap-and-trade allowances are distributed to the economic sectors currently
receiving GGRF appropriations. These funds work to achieve further GHG reductions
in California, lower the cost of reducing GHG emissions to businesses, and protect
disadvantaged communities. Any remaining auction proceeds after the distribution of
$2 billion through GGRF sectors are distributed evenly to consumers in California as a
dividend. The estimated costs in Table III-7 include the cost of the GHG reductions to
sectors, as well as the benefit of a portion of those costs disbursed through the GGRF
and as a dividend to consumers, as detailed in Appendix E.

Table III-7 was estimated using the REMI model. The range of costs for the Proposed Plan represents the impact of achieving
the SB 32 target through prescriptive measures and the Cap-and-Trade Program at the C+T Floor Price (the lower bounds) and
the C+T Reserve Price (the upper bounds).

It is important to put the results of Table III-7 into context. First, reducing GHG
emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels under the Proposed Plan will lead to avoided
social damages from climate change on the order of $2.4 to $11 billion, as estimated
using the SC-CO2, as well as additional potential savings from reductions in air pollution
and petroleum dependence. These impacts are not included in this economic analysis.
Second, in 2030, the California economy is projected to grow to $3.4 trillion, an average
growth rate of 2.2 percent per year from 2020 to 2030. Even without including the
potentially significant economic benefits of emissions reductions in the Proposed Plan,
implementation of the Plan is not estimated to change the annual GDP growth across
the range of allowance prices. Based on this analysis, in 2030 the California economy
will take only three months longer to get to the GDP anticipated in the Reference
scenario.
Determining employment changes as a result of policies is challenging to model, due to
a range of uncertainties and global trends that will influence the California economy,
regardless of implementation of the Proposed Plan. The global economy is seeing a
shift toward automation and mechanization, which may lead to slowing of employment
across some industries globally, irrespective of California’s energy and low carbon
investments. In California, employment is projected to reach 23.5 million jobs in 2030.
In this analysis, implementing the Proposed Plan would change that growth of
employment by less than half of 1 percent.
Estimated personal income in California is relatively unchanged under the Proposed
Plan relative to the Reference scenario. Considering the uncertainty in the modeling,
modest changes in the growth of personal income are not different from zero, which
suggests that meeting the SB 32 target will not change the growth of personal income
relative to the Reference scenario.
When analyzing the estimated macroeconomic impacts, it is important to remember that
73

a major substitution of electricity and capital away from fossil fuels is anticipated to have
a very small effect on California GDP, employment, and personal income—less than
1 percent relative to the Reference scenario in 2030. The economic impacts indicate
that shifting money and investment away from fossil fuels and to clean energy is likely to
have a negligible effect on the California economy. Additionally, it is certain that
innovation will continue as new technologies are developed and implemented. While
this analysis projects the costs and GHG reductions of current technologies over time, it
does not capture the impact of new technologies that may shift the economy and
California in unanticipated ways or benefits related to changes in air pollution and
impacts on human health, avoided environmental damages, and impacts to natural and
working lands. Thus, the results of this analysis very likely underestimate the benefits of
shifting to a clean energy economy.
Consumer spending also shifts in response to implementation of the Proposed Plan
relative to the Reference scenario. As presented in Table III-7, there is a negligible
impact to consumer income, but small changes in income can alter the distribution of
consumer spending among categories. In 2030, consumer spending is lower under the
Proposed Plan than in the Reference scenario across all analyzed allowance prices.
Consumers spend less on fuels, electricity, natural gas, and capital as a result of
measures in the Proposed Plan that reduce demand, increase efficiency, and drive
technological innovations. The estimated impact to California households is also
modest in 2030, as outlined in Table III-8. In 2030, the average annual cost per
household of the Proposed Plan ranges from $30 to $215 (labeled incremental cost in
Table III-8), depending on the price of reductions under the Cap-and-Trade Program.82
In 2030, as modeled in the Reference scenario, households will spend $3,533 on
equipment and fuel.
Implementing the prescriptive measures in the Proposed Plan will change household
fuel and equipment expenditures as is estimated to result in a $45 savings per
household in 2030. The additional reductions needed to achieve the SB 32 target,
obtained through the Cap-and-Trade Program, result in a cumulative annual cost of $30
to $215 to households in 2030, relative to the Reference scenario. The household
impact of the Cap-and-Trade Program assumes that all costs of GHG reductions in the
Cap-and-Trade Program are passed to consumers and therefore represents the upper
bounds of the estimated household impact. It does not account for benefits from
reduced climate impacts, health savings from reduced air pollution impacts, or lower
petroleum dependence costs that might impact households.
While not significant, the range of household impacts represents changes in fuel
expenditures and capital investment as a result of the prescriptive measures and Capand-Trade component of the Proposed Plan. As modeled, the household impact of the
Proposed Plan comprises less than 1 percent of average household expenditures in
2030. To ensure that vulnerable populations and low-income households are not
disproportionately affected by California’s climate policy, CARB is taking steps to better
quantify localized economic impacts and ensure that low-income households see

tangible benefits from the Proposed Plan. Researchers at the University of California,
Los Angeles (UCLA) are currently working on a retrospective analysis that will estimate
the impacts across California communities of the implementation of AB 32, which will
help identify areas of focus as 2030 measures are developed. The Cap-and-Trade
Program will also continue to provide benefit to disadvantaged communities through the
disbursement of GGRF funds.

The investments made in implementing the Proposed Plan will have long-term benefits
and present significant opportunities for California investors and businesses, as upfront
capital investments will result in long-term fuel and energy efficiency savings, the
benefits of which will continue into the future. The California economy will continue to
grow under the Proposed Plan, but it will grow more resilient, more sustainable, and will
be well positioned to reap the long-term benefits of lower carbon investments.
Estimating the Economic Impact on Disadvantaged Communities
As described above, and even with significant unquantified benefits, implementing the
Proposed Plan is estimated to have a small impact on the Statewide California economy
through 2030. However, shifting from fossil fuels can disproportionately affect specific
geographic regions whose local economies rely on fossil fuel intensive industries.
These regions can also include vulnerable populations and disadvantaged communities
who may be disproportionately impacted by poor air quality and climate.
Achieving the SB 32 target will require sectors and regions to respond to the challenges
and opportunities as California continues its transition to a clean energy
economy. While the economic modeling does not show the impact to specific regions
or populations, policy action at the State, regional, and local level can help to ensure
that disadvantaged communities and vulnerable populations are able to benefit from
technological innovation and the benefits of the clean energy economy.
This economic analysis will be revised prior to the final release of the 2030 Target
Scoping Plan to include additional analyses including a regional impact analysis to
estimate the distribution of economic impacts across regions of the State, including
disadvantaged communities. In addition, there are currently three research contracts
underway at CARB to quantify the impact of California’s climate policy on regions and
disadvantaged communities throughout California. As mentioned above, researchers
from UCLA are estimating the improvements in health outcomes associated with AB 32,
with a focus on disadvantaged communities. This research will be informed by input
from technical advisory committees including a group focused on environmental justice.
75

There are also two studies currently underway to quantify the impact of GGRF funds. A
UCLA contract focuses on quantifying job creation under GGRF in California, while a
University of California, Berkeley, contract is constructing methodologies to assess the
co-benefits of GGRF projects across California. These research efforts will provide a
regional analysis of the impact of and benefits to specific communities and sectors to
ensure that all Californians see economic benefits, in addition to clean air benefits, from
the implementing the Proposed Plan.

Public Health

Addressing climate change could represent the greatest opportunity to improve public
health in our time.83 Many measures to reduce GHG emissions also have significant
health co-benefits that can address climate change and improve the health and wellbeing of all populations across the State. Climate change is already affecting the health
of communities.84 Climate-related health impacts can include increased heat illness and
death, increases in air pollution-related exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory
diseases, injury and loss of life due to severe storms and flooding, increased vectorborne and water-borne diseases, and stress and mental trauma due to extreme
weather-related catastrophes.85 The urgency of action to address the impacts already
being felt from a changing climate and the threats in coming decades provides an
unprecedented opportunity for California’s leadership in climate action to reduce GHG
emissions and create healthy, equitable, and resilient communities where all people
thrive. This section discusses the link between climate change and public health. It
does not analyze the specific measures included in the strategy but provides context for
assessing the potential measures and scenarios.
Achieving Health Equity through Climate Action
Many populations in California face health inequities, or unfair and unjust health
differences between population groups that are systemic and avoidable.86 Differences
in environmental and socioeconomic determinants of health result in these health
inequities. Those facing the greatest health inequities include low-income individuals
and households, the very young and the very old, communities of color, and those who
have been marginalized or discriminated against based on gender or race/ethnicity. 87 It
is these very same populations, along with those suffering existing health conditions
and certain populations of workers (e.g., outdoor workers), that climate change will most
disproportionately impact.88 The inequitable distribution of social, political, and
economic power results in health inequities, while perpetuating systems (e.g.,

economic, transportation, land use, etc.) drive GHG emissions. As a result,
communities face inequitable living conditions. For example, low-income communities
of color tend to live in more polluted areas and face climate change impacts that can
compound and exacerbate existing sensitivities and vulnerabilities.89,90 Fair and healthy
climate action requires that the inequities that create and intensify community
vulnerabilities be addressed. The capacity for climate resilience is significantly driven
by living conditions and the forces that shape them, such as income, education,
housing, transportation, environmental quality, and access to services. Thus, strategies
such as alleviating poverty, increasing access to opportunity, improving living
conditions, and reducing health and social inequities will result in more climate-resilient
communities. In fact, there are already many “no-regret” climate mitigation and
adaptation measures available (discussed below) that can reduce health burdens,
increase community resilience, and address social inequities.91 Focusing efforts to
achieve health equity can thus lead to significant progress in addressing human-caused
climate change.
Potential Health Impacts of Climate Change Mitigation Measures
Socioeconomic Factors: Income, Poverty, and Wealth
Economic factors, such as income, poverty, and wealth, are collectively one of the
largest determinants of health. As such, climate mitigation measures that yield
economic benefits can improve population health significantly, especially if the
economic benefits are directed to those most vulnerable and disadvantaged (including
those living in poverty) who often face the most health challenges. From the poorest to
richest ends of the income spectrum, higher income is associated with greater longevity
in the United States.92,93,94 The gap in life expectancy between the richest 1 percent
and poorest 1 percent of Americans was almost 15 years for men in 2014, and about
10 years for women.95 Early death among those living in poverty is not a result of those
with higher incomes having better access to quality health care.96 Only about 10–
20 percent of a person’s health status is accounted for by health care (and
20– 30 percent attributed to genetics), while the remainder is attributed to the social
determinants of health. These include environmental quality, social and economic
circumstances, and the social, media, policy, economic, retail, and built environments—
all of which in turn shape stress levels and behaviors, including smoking, diet, and
exercise.97,98,99,100,101,102,103,104,105,106,107 In fact, where people live, work, learn, and play

is often a stronger predictor of life expectancy than their genetic and biological
makeup.108 The World Health Organization’s Commission on the Social Determinants
of Health concluded that the poor health of poor people, and the social gradient in
health, are caused by the unequal distribution of power, income, goods, and services
resulting from poor social policies and programs, unfair economic arrangements, and
bad politics.109 Thus, improving the conditions of daily life and tackling the inequitable
distribution of power, money, and resources can remedy inequitable health
outcomes.110 Simply put, the more evenly distributed the wealth, the healthier a
society is.111
The wealth-health gradient has significant implications for the Proposed Plan. State
climate legislation and policies require prioritizing GHG reduction strategies that serve
vulnerable populations and improve well-being for disadvantaged communities. As
such, strategies that improve the financial security of communities facing disadvantage
while reducing GHG emissions are win-win strategies. These include providing funds or
services for GHG reduction programs (e.g., weatherization, energy efficiency,
renewable energy, ZEVs, transit, housing, and others) to low-income individuals and
households to help them reduce costs. Among the poorest 25 percent of people, per
capita government expenditures are strongly associated with longer life spans.112
Successful strategies California has already implemented to assure the poor do not pay
higher costs for societal GHG reductions include low-income energy discount programs,
in combination with direct climate credits, and policies and programs that help
Californians reduce electricity, natural gas, and gasoline consumption.113 More such
strategies could be pursued. To tackle the inequitable distribution of power that leads to
disparate health outcomes, agencies can first assure they have robust structures for
civic engagement so that people facing health inequities can themselves participate in
decision-making about solutions. Whether it is absolute poverty or relative deprivation

that leads to poor health, investments and policies that both lift up the poor and reduce
wealth disparities will address the multiple problems of climate change mitigation,
adaptation, and health inequities.
Employment
Employment status impacts human health in many ways. Poor health outcomes of
unemployment include premature death, self-rated ill-health (a strong predictor of poor
health outcomes), and mental illness.114,115,116,117 Economic strain related to
unemployment can impact mental health and trigger stress that is linked to other health
conditions.118,119 Populations of color are overrepresented in the unemployment and
under-employment ranks, which likely contributes to racial health inequities. In 2014,
14.7 percent of African-Americans, 12.1 percent of American Indians and Alaska
Natives, and 9.8 percent of Latinos were unemployed, compared to 7.9 percent of
Whites.120 In addition to providing income, the work experience has health
consequences. There is a work status–health gradient similar to the wealth–health
gradient. Workers with lower occupational status have a higher risk of death,121
increased blood pressure,122 and more heart attacks.123,124 Higher status workers often
have a greater sense of autonomy, control over their work, and predictability, compared
to lower status workers, whose lack of control and predictability translates to stress that
shortens their lives.125 Nonstandard working arrangements such as part-time, seasonal,
shift, contract, or informal sector work have been linked to greater psychological
distress and poorer physical health.126,127 Women are heavily overrepresented in
nonstandard work, as are people of color and people with low levels of education.128,129

The implementation of California’s climate change goals provides great opportunity to
not only improve the habitability of the planet, but also to increase economic vitality,
employ historically disadvantaged people in secure jobs, and improve the health of the
population. Measures in the Proposed Plan that aim to reduce greenhouse gases can
simultaneously improve health and social equity by prioritizing or requiring that:
(1) infrastructure projects using public funds pay living wages, provide quality benefits to
all employees, and minimize nonstandard work; (2) locals are hired as much as is
feasible; (3) preference is given for women-owned and minority-owned businesses;
(4) employers receiving public funds assess and reduce work stress and lack of
workplace control; (5) projects benefiting from State climate investments prioritize hiring
from historically hard-to-employ groups, such as youth (especially youth of color),
formerly incarcerated people, and people with physical or mental illness; and (6) training
is provided to these same groups to work in jobs in sectors that will support a
sustainable economy.
Communications Supporting Climate Change Behaviors and Policies
California’s leadership on GHG reduction is exceptional. However, climate mitigation
goals are often treated independently by sector, and the public does not see a unified
message that changes must take place on every level in every sector to preserve
human health and well-being. Climate strategy could be supported by public
communications campaigns that link sectors and present a message of the need for
bold action, along with the benefits that action can yield. Mass media communications
and social marketing campaigns can help shift social and cultural norms toward
sustainable and healthy practices. Messaging about the co-benefits of climate change
policies in improving health and well-being can lead to increased community and
decision-maker support among vulnerable groups for policies and measures outlined in
the Proposed Plan.
Community Engagement Leads to Robust, Lasting, and Effective Climate Policies
For California’s climate change policies to be supported by the public and be
implemented with enthusiasm, they must be developed through ample, genuine
opportunities for community members to discuss and provide input. Californians’
contributions to the policy arena strengthen the end products and assist in their
implementation and enforcement.
Efforts to mitigate climate change through policy, environmental, and systems change
present considerable opportunities to promote sustainable, healthy, resilient, and
equitable communities. The measures in the Proposed Plan, and the way they are
implemented, can help create living conditions that facilitate physical activity; encourage
public transit use; provide access to affordable, fresh, and nutritious foods; protect the
natural systems on which human health depends; spur economic development; provide
safe, affordable, and energy-efficient housing; enable access to jobs; and increase
social cohesion and civic engagement. These climate change mitigation measures can
improve overall population health, as well as material conditions, access to opportunity,
and health and well-being in communities facing health inequities. Approaching the
policy solutions outlined in the Proposed Plan with a health and equity lens can
80

ultimately help lead to a California in which all current and future generations of
Californians can benefit and thrive.

Environmental Analysis

CARB, as the lead agency for the Proposed 2030 Target Scoping Plan, prepared a
Draft Environmental Analysis (EA) in accordance with the requirements of the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and CARB’s regulatory program certified
by the Secretary of Natural Resources (California Code of Regulation, title 17,
sections 60006–60008; California Code of Regulation, title 14, section 15251,
subdivision (d)). The resource areas from the CEQA Guidelines Environmental
Checklist were used as a framework for a programmatic environmental analysis of the
reasonably foreseeable compliance responses resulting from implementation of the
proposed measures discussed in the Proposed Plan. The Draft EA provides an
analysis of both the beneficial and adverse impacts and feasible mitigation measures
for the reasonably foreseeable compliance responses associated with the proposed
measures. Collectively, the Draft EA concluded that implementation of these actions
could result in the following short-term and long-term beneficial and adverse impacts:
 Beneficial long-term impacts to air quality, energy demand and greenhouse gas
emissions.
 Less than significant impacts to air quality, energy demand, resources related
to land use planning, mineral resources, population and housing, public
services, and recreational services.
 Potentially significant and unavoidable adverse impacts to aesthetics,
agriculture and forest resources, air quality, biological resources, cultural
resources, geology and soils, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and
water quality, resources related to land use planning, noise, recreational
services, transportation/traffic, and utilities and service systems.
The potentially significant and unavoidable adverse impacts are primarily related to
short-term construction-related activities, which explains why some resource areas
are identified above as having both less-than-significant impacts and potentially
significant impacts. Please refer to the Draft EA in Appendix F for further details.
CARB will prepare written responses to all comments received on the Draft EA, which
will be presented to the Board for consideration along with the Final EA.

81

IV.

Key Sectors

Climate change mitigation policies must be considered in the context of the sector’s
contribution to the State’s total GHGs, while also considering any co-benefits for criteria
pollutant and toxic air contaminant reductions. The transportation, electricity (in-state
and imported), and industrial sectors are the largest contributors to the GHG inventory
and present the largest opportunities for GHG reductions. However, to ensure
decarbonization across the entire economy and to meet our 2030 GHG target, policies
must be considered for other sectors. Policies that support energy efficiency,
alternative fuels, and renewable power also can provide co-benefits for both criteria and
toxic air pollutants.
Any specific policies identified within the Final Plan that will ultimately be considered by
the Board or other State agencies for adoption will be subject to subsequent analytical
and public processes to develop and identify the full requirements and process for
implementation. For example, a change in the LCFS Carbon Intensity (CI) target would
only take effect after a subsequent rulemaking for that regulation that would include its
own public process and environmental, economic, and public health analyses. Many
policies for reducing emissions toward the 2030 target are already known. For instance,
the increased RPS, energy efficiency requirements, and various transportation plans will
go far in reducing GHGs toward achieving the 2030 target, while delivering reductions in
criteria and toxic air pollutants. This Proposed Plan identifies these and additional
policies or program enhancements we will need to achieve remaining GHG reductions
in a complementary, flexible, and cost-effective manner to meet the 2030 target. These
policies should continue to encourage reductions beyond 2030 to keep us on track to
stabilize the climate. Policies that ensure economy-wide investment decisions that
incorporate consideration of GHG emissions are particularly important.
As we pursue GHG reduction targets, we must acknowledge the integrated nature of
our built and natural environments, and cross-sector impacts of policy choices. Some
strategies do not fit neatly into one sector category, such as Green Buildings, which
cross the energy, transportation, water, waste, and land use sectors. Green building
regulations and programs offer complementary opportunities to address the direct and
indirect effects of buildings on the environment by incorporating strategies to minimize
overall energy use, water use, waste generation, and transportation impacts. The
Governor’s Green Buildings Executive Order B-18-12 for State buildings and the
California Green Building Standards (CALGreen) Code130 are key state initiatives
supporting emission reductions associated with buildings, and some local governments
are taking action by adopting “beyond code” green building standards. Looking forward,
there is a need to establish a path toward transitioning to zero net carbon buildings,
which will be the next generation of buildings that can contribute significantly to
achieving long-term climate goals. Recent research activities have provided results to
better quantify GHG emission reductions of green buildings, and additional research

130

The authority to update and implement the CALGreen Code is the responsibility of several State agencies identified in California
Building Standards Law.

82

activities need to continue to expand their focus to support technical feasibility
evaluations and implementation.
Each of the policies directed at the built environment must be considered in the broader
context of the high-level goals for other sectors, including the Natural and Working
Lands sector. For example, policies that support natural and working lands can reduce
emissions and sequester carbon, while also providing ecosystem benefits such as
better water quality, increased water yield, soil health, reduced erosion, and habitat
connectivity. These policies and co-benefits will be considered as part of the integrated
strategy outlined above. Table lV-1 provides examples of the cross-sector interactions
between and among the main sectors analyzed for the Proposed Plan that are
discussed in this chapter (Energy, Transportation, Industry, Water, Waste Management,
and Natural and Working Lands), and which are discussed in this chapter.
This chapter recognizes these interactions and relates these broad strategic options to
the specific additional programs recommended in Chapter ll of this document.
Accordingly, Chapter lV provides an overview of each sector’s contributions to the
State’s GHG emissions, a description of both ongoing and proposed programs and
policies to meet the 2030 target, and additional climate policy steps that could be
considered in the future. The wide array of complementary and supporting measures
being contemplated or undertaken across State government are detailed here. The
broad view of State action described in this chapter thus provides context for the
narrower set of measures discussed in detail in Chapter ll of this Proposed Plan. It is
these measures in Chapter ll that CARB staff has identified as specific actions to meet
the 2030 target in SB 32.
The following phrases have specific meanings in this discussion of the policy landscape:
“Ongoing and Proposed Measures” refers to programs and policies that are either
ongoing existing efforts, or efforts required by statute or about to begin. These
measures include those identified as necessary specific actions to meet the 2030 GHG
target, and which are set apart and described in greater detail in Chapter ll. “Sector
Measures” listed also include cross-cutting measures that affect many entities in the
sector; some of these are also identified in Chapter ll. “Potential Additional Actions” are
not being proposed as part of the specific strategy to achieve the 2030 target in this
Proposed Plan. However, this Proposed Plan aims to spur thinking and exploration of
innovative new technologies and polices that may help the State achieve its long-term
climate goals. Some of these items may not ever be formally proposed, but they are
included here because CARB, other agencies, and stakeholders believe their potential
should be explored with stakeholders in coming years.

A.

Low Carbon Energy

The energy sector in California is composed of electricity and natural gas infrastructure,
which brings electricity and natural gas to homes, businesses, and industry. This vast
system is critical to California’s economy and public well-being, and pivotal to reducing
its GHG emissions.
Historically, power plants generated electricity largely by combusting fossil fuels. In the
1970s and early 1980s, a significant portion of California’s power supply came from coal
and petroleum resources. To reduce air pollution and promote fuel diversity, the State
has shifted away from these resources to natural gas, renewable energy, and energy
efficiency programs, resulting in significant GHG emissions reductions. Emissions from
the electricity sector are currently approximately 20 percent below 1990 levels and are
well on their way to achieving deeper emissions cuts by 2030. Since 2008, renewable
generation almost doubled, coal generation was reduced by more than half, and GHG
emissions were reduced by a quarter.
Carbon dioxide is the primary GHG associated with the electricity and natural gas
systems. The electricity sector, which is composed of in-state generation and imported
power to serve California load, has made great strides to help California achieve its
climate change objectives. Renewable energy has shown tremendous growth, with
capacity from large-scale solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass power
plants growing from 6,600 megawatts (MW) in 2010 to nearly 14,300 MW in 2015.131,132
Renewable energy adoption in California has been promoted through the RPS and
several funding mechanisms, such as the California Solar Initiative (CSI) programs,
Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP), Net-Energy Metering (NEM), and federal tax
credits. These mandates and incentives have spurred both utility-scale and small-scale
customer-developed renewable energy projects.
SB 350 requires large publicly owned utilities and all load-serving entities under the
jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to file integrated
resource plans (IRPs) with the California Energy Commission (CEC) and CPUC,
respectively. Through their IRPs, filing entities will demonstrate how they will meet the
electricity sector’s share of the State’s 2030 GHG reduction target while ensuring
reliability in a cost-effective manner. The CEC and CPUC are currently developing the
guidelines that publicly owned utilities and load-serving entities will follow to prepare
and submit IRPs. The Proposed Plan is expected to provide information to help
establish the range of GHG reductions required for the electricity sector, and those
numbers will be translated into planning target ranges in the IRP process. The IRP
process will grant retail electricity sellers in California some flexibility to determine the

optimal way to reduce GHG emissions, based on the IRP Reference System Plan,133 to
achieve the electricity sector’s share of the 2030 goal.
Energy efficiency is another key component to reducing energy sector GHG emissions,
and it will be another consideration in each agency’s IRP process. Utilities have been
offering energy efficiency programs, such as incentives, to California customers for
decades, and CEC has continually updated building and appliance standards. In the
context of IRPs, utility-ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs will likely continue
to play an important role in reducing GHG emissions in the electricity sector.
SB 350 requires CEC and CPUC to establish annual targets for statewide energy
efficiency savings and demand reduction that will achieve a cumulative doubling of
statewide energy efficiency savings in electricity and natural gas end uses by 2030.
These targets can be achieved through appliance and building energy efficiency
standards; utility incentive, rebate, and technical assistance programs; third-party
delivered energy efficiency programs; and other programs. Achieving greater efficiency
savings in existing buildings, as directed by Governor Brown in his 2015 inaugural
speech, will be essential to meet the goal of doubling energy efficiency savings. In
September 2015, CEC adopted the Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Action Draft
Plan, which is designed to provide foundational support and strategies to enable scaling
of energy efficiency in the built environment. Pursuant to SB 350, CEC published an
updated Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Action Plan prior to January 2017. More
than $10 billion in private capital investment will be needed to double statewide
efficiency savings in California.134 Energy efficiency programs are one part of the
broader green buildings strategy, which incorporates additional measures to minimize
water use, waste generation, and transportation impacts.
Fossil-fuel-based natural gas is a significant fuel source for both in-State electricity
generation and electricity imported into California. It is also used in transportation
applications and in residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural sector end uses.
Greenhouse gas emissions from combustion of fossil natural gas decreased from
134.71 MMTCO2e in 2000 to 127.73 MMTCO2e in 2014, while natural gas pipeline
fugitive emissions were estimated to be 4.0 MMTCO2e in 2014 and have been nearly
unchanged since 2000.135 Greenhouse gas-reduction strategies should focus on
efficiency, reducing leakage from well and pipelines, implementing the SLCP strategy,
and studying the potential for renewable natural gas (RNG) fuel switching
(i.e., renewable hydrogen blended with methane or biomethane).
Renewable natural gas volume has been increasing from approximately 1.5 million
diesel gallon equivalent (dge) in 2011 to more than 68.5 million dge in 2015, and
continued substitution of RNG for fossil natural gas would help California reduce its

The Reference System Plan will be used in the IRP process to guide investment, resource acquisition, and programmatic
decisions to reach the State’s policy goals, in addition to informing the development of individual load serving entities IRPs.

dependence on fossil fuels. In addition, RNG can be sourced by recovering methane
from landfills, livestock operations, and wastewater treatment facilities through the use
of existing technologies, thereby also reducing methane emissions. The capture and
productive use of renewable methane from these and other sources is consistent with
requirements of SB 1383.
Collectively, renewable energy and energy efficiency measures can result in significant
public health and climate benefits by displacing air pollution and GHG emissions from
fossil-fuel based energy sources, as well as by reducing the health and environmental
risks associated with the drilling, extraction, transportation, and storage of fossil fuels,
especially for communities living near fossil-fuel based energy operations.136
As the energy sector continues to evolve and decarbonize, both the behavior of
individual facilities and the design of the grid itself will change, with important
distributional effects. Some power plants may operate more flexibly to balance
renewables, emerging resources (including storage) will become more prevalent, and
aging facilities may retire and be replaced. In turn, this may shift patterns of criteria
pollutant emissions at these facilities. Because many existing power plants are in, or
near, disadvantaged communities, it is of particular importance to ensure that this
transition to a cleaner grid does not result in unintended negative impacts to these
communities.

Looking to the Future

This section outlines the high-level objectives and goals to reduce GHGs in this sector.
Electricity Goals
 Achieve sector-wide and load-serving entity specific GHG reduction planning
targets set by the State through Integrated Resource Planning.
 Reduce fossil fuel use.
 Reduce energy demand.
Natural Gas Goals
 Ensure safety of natural gas system.
 Decrease fugitive methane emissions.
 Reduce dependence on fossil natural gas.
2.

Cross-Sector Interactions

The energy sector interacts with nearly all sectors of the economy. Siting of power
plants (including solar and wind facilities) and transmission and distribution lines has
impacts on land use in California—be it conversion of agricultural or natural and working
lands, impacts to sensitive species and habitats, or implications to disadvantaged,
vulnerable, and environmental justice communities. Additionally, more compact

development patterns reduce per capita energy demands, while less-compact sprawl
increases them. Further, efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector
include electrification. Some industrial sources also use electricity as a primary or
auxiliary source of power for manufacturing. In the future, industrial facilities may
electrify their systems instead of relying on natural gas. These activities will increase
demand for this sector. In addition, water is used in various applications in the energy
sector, ranging in intensity from cooling of turbines and other equipment at power plants
to cleaning solar photovoltaic panels. Given California’s historic drought, water use for
the electricity sector is an important consideration for operation, maintenance, and
construction activities.
Continued planning and coordination with federal, State, and local agencies,
governments, tribes, and stakeholders will be crucial to minimizing environmental and
health impacts from the energy sector, deploying new technologies, and identifying
feedstocks.

Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gases

The measures below include some required and new potential measures to help
achieve the State’s 2030 target and to support the high-level objectives for this sector.
Some measures may be designed to directly address GHG reductions, while others
may result in GHG reductions as a co-benefit.

Industry

California’s robust economy, with the largest manufacturing sector in the United States,
is supported by a variety of sub-industrial sectors, some of which include cement plants,
refineries, food processors, paper products, wineries, steel plants, and industrial gas,
entertainment, technology and software, aerospace, and defense companies.
Together, industrial sources account for approximately 21 percent of the State’s GHG
emissions—almost equal to the amount of GHG emissions from the energy sector.
Emissions in this sector are mainly due to fuel combustion and, in some industries,
process-related emissions. Changes in this sector strongly correlate with changes in
the overall economy. For example, housing and construction growth usually increases
demand for cement. Moving toward a cleaner economy and ensuring we meet the
statewide targets requires us to address GHG emissions in this sector, which has the
potential to provide local co-benefits in criteria pollutant and toxic air contaminant
reductions in immediate surrounding locations, especially in vulnerable communities. At
the same time, we must ensure there is a smooth path to a cleaner future to support a
resilient and robust economy with a strong job force, including training opportunities for
workers in disadvantaged communities, while continuing to support economic growth in
existing and new industries.
Greenhouse gas emissions in the Industrial sector have remained relatively flat for the
last few years while the State’s economy has continued to grow, meaning the GHG
emissions to produce each dollar of gross standard product is decreasing. In 2015, this
sector accounted for approximately 20 percent of the State’s GDP. In 2015, California
industry exported $165.4 billion in merchandise.138 Policies to address GHG emission
reductions must continue to balance the State’s economic well-being with making
progress toward achievement of the statewide limits.
As this sector is dominated by combustion-related emissions, policies and measures to
supply cleaner fuels and more efficient technology are the key to reducing GHG
emissions. Some sectors, such as cement and glass, also have significant process
emissions, and there may be fewer opportunities to address those process emissions,
as they are related to chemical reactions and processes to meet safety, productspecific, or regulatory standards for the final products. Another important aspect for this
sector is its role as the State transitions to a cleaner future. Infrastructure, including
existing facilities and new facilities, can support the production of new technology to
bolster the State’s efforts to address GHGs. For example, existing refineries have an
opportunity to move away from fossil fuel production and switch to the production of
biofuels and clean technology. Another example of a switch to a cleaner technology is

Tesla’s Fremont, California, facility that was a former General Motors and Toyota
factory. As the State works to double energy efficiency in existing buildings, there will
be an increased demand for efficient lighting fixtures, building insulation, low-e139
coatings for existing windows, or new windows—goods which could be produced in
California. Three predominant in-State paths to reducing GHG emissions for the
Industrial sector are: fuel switching, energy efficiency improvements, or the relocation of
production to outside the State. Carbon capture and sequestration also offers a
potential new, long-term path for reducing GHGs for large stationary sources.
While fuel switching and energy efficiency are beneficial strategies, relocation of
production to outside the State is disadvantageous for a couple of reasons. First, AB 32
requires the State’s climate policies to minimize emissions leakage, and relocation
would shift GHG emissions outside of the State, resulting in emissions leakage.
Second, it could also reduce the availability of associated jobs and could impact a local
tax base that supports local services such as public transportation, emergency
response, and social services, as well as funding sources critical to protecting the
natural environment and keeping it available for current and future generations.
Even while we continue to seek further GHG reductions in the sector, it is important to
recognize the State has a long history of addressing health-based air pollutants in this
sector. Many of the actions for addressing criteria pollutants and toxic air contaminants
in the industrial sector are driven by California’s local air district stationary source
requirements to ensure progress toward achieving State and national ambient air quality
standards. Some of those actions, such as use of Best Available Control Technology,
have resulted in co-benefits in the form of GHG reductions. The State must continue to
strengthen its existing criteria and toxic air pollutant programs and relationships with
local air districts to ensure all Californians have healthy, clean air. This is especially
true in disadvantaged communities.
AB 32 directed CARB to take several actions to address GHG emissions, such as early
action measures, GHG reporting requirements for the largest GHG sources, and other
measures. In response, the State adopted multiple measures and regulations, including
regulations for high global warming potential (high-GWP) gases used in refrigeration
systems and the semiconductor industry.140 These regulations apply to specific GHGs
and types of equipment that can be found across the economy. For example, highGWP gases are found in refrigeration systems in large food processing plants and
chemical and petrochemical facilities, among others.141

139

Low-e coatings reduce the emissivity, or heat transfer, from a window to improve its insulating properties.
ARB. Refrigerant Management Program. www.arb.ca.gov/cc/rmp/rmp.htm
141
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) has also enacted regulations to reduce hydrofluorocarbon (HFC)
emissions by prohibiting high-GWP refrigerants in new retail food refrigeration equipment and in chillers used for large airconditioning applications. On the international level, the European Union F-gas regulations went into effect January 1, 2015. Those
regulations prohibit high-GWP HFCs in new equipment and require a gradual phasedown in the production and import of HFCs. A
similar HFC phasedown that would take place globally was the subject of international negotiations during the Montreal Protocol
meeting in Rwanda from October 10–14, 2016. Those negotiations resulted in an agreement that will phase down the use of HFCs
and put the world on track to avoid nearly 0.5oC of warming by 2100.
140

93

The State has also adopted the first in the world economy-wide cap-and-trade program
that applies to all large industrial GHG emitters, imported electricity, and fuel and natural
gas suppliers. The Cap-and-Trade Program is a key element of California’s GHG
reduction strategy. The Cap-and-Trade Regulation establishes a declining limit on
major sources of GHG emissions, and it creates a powerful economic incentive for
major investment in cleaner, more efficient technologies. The Cap-and-Trade Program
applies to emissions that cover about 80 percent of the State’s GHG emissions. CARB
creates allowances equal to the total amount of permissible emissions (i.e., the “cap”)
over a given compliance period. One allowance equals one metric ton of GHG
emissions. Fewer allowances are created each year, thus the annual cap declines and
statewide emissions are reduced over time. An increasing annual auction reserve (or
floor) price for allowances and the reduction in annual allowance budgets creates a
steady and sustained pressure for covered entities to reduce their GHGs. All covered
entities in the Cap-and-Trade Program are still subject to the air quality permit limits for
criteria and toxic air pollutants.
The Cap-and-Trade Program is designed to achieve the most cost-effective statewide
GHG emission reductions; there are no individual or facility-specific GHG emission
reduction requirements. Each entity covered by the Cap-and-Trade Regulation has a
compliance obligation that is set by its GHG emissions over a compliance period, and
entities are required to meet that compliance obligation by acquiring and surrendering
allowances in an amount equal to their compliance obligation. Companies can also
meet a limited portion of their compliance obligation by acquiring and surrendering
offset credits, which are compliance instruments that are based on rigorously verified
emission reductions that occur from projects outside the scope of the Cap-and-Trade
Program. Like allowances, each offset credit is equal to one metric ton of GHG
emissions. The program began in January 2013 and achieved a near 100 percent
compliance rate for the first compliance period (2013–2014). Reported and verified
emissions covered by the Cap-and-Trade Program have been below the cap throughout
the first years of the Program.142
Allowances are issued by CARB and distributed by free allocation and by sale at
auctions. CARB also provides for free allocation to some entities covered by the
Program to address potential trade exposure due to the cost of compliance with the
Program and address concerns of relocation of production out-of-state and resulting
emissions leakage. Offset credits are issued by CARB to qualifying offset projects.
Secondary markets exist where allowances and offset credits may be sold and traded
among Cap-and-Trade Program participants. Facilities must submit allowances and
offsets to match their annual GHG emissions. Facilities that emit more GHG emissions
must surrender more allowances or offset credits, and facilities that can cut their
emissions need to surrender fewer compliance instruments. Entities have flexibility to
choose the lowest-cost approach to achieving program compliance; they may purchase
allowances at auction, trade allowances and offset credits with others, take steps to
reduce emissions at their own facilities, or utilize a combination of these approaches.

94

Proceeds from the sale of State-owned allowances at auction are placed into the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.
It is important to note that while the Cap-and-Trade Program is designed to reduce
GHGs for the industrial sector, there are recommendations from the EJAC (or
Committee) for the State to pursue more facility-specific GHG reduction measures to
achieve potential local air quality co-benefits, and AB 197 directs CARB to prioritize
direct reductions at large stationary sources. The Committee has expressed a strong
preference to forgo the existing Cap-and-Trade Program and rely on prescriptive facility
level regulations. It is also important to note that GHG, criteria pollutant, and toxic air
contaminant trends are not always correlated. In some situations, criteria pollutants
may actually be produced by actions such as destruction of methane through
combustion devices or remain unchanged when fossil natural gas is displaced with
renewable natural gas in large boilers. Regardless, there remains a need to develop or
enhance existing measures to address criteria and toxic air pollutants as those pose
local air quality health issues for communities adjacent to industrial sources. To
address these specific concerns, State and local agencies must continue to evaluate
and implement measures that result in quantifiable reductions in criteria and toxic air
pollutants.
1.

Looking to the Future

This section outlines the high-level objectives and goals to reduce GHGs in this sector.
Goals
 Increase energy efficiency.
 Increase fuel switching to non-fossil fuel.
 Promote and support industry that provides products and clean technology
needed to achieve the State’s climate goals.
 Create market signals for low carbon intensity products.
 Maximize air quality co-benefits.
 Support a resilient low carbon economy and strong job force.
 Make California the epicenter for research, development, and deployment of
technology needed to achieve a near-zero carbon future.
2.

Cross-Sector Interactions

There are clear, direct relationships between the industrial sector and other sectors that
go beyond the economic support that a strong economy provides. For instance, this
sector could increase its use of renewable fuels such as biomethane, which would be
sourced from landfills or dairies. Additionally, some industries could shift from raw
materials to recycled materials to reduce waste and reduce GHG emissions associated
with processing of raw materials. Further, addressing energy efficiency could reduce
onsite heating, water, and fuel demand. Moreover, supporting mass-transit or ride
share programs for employees would reduce VMT. Finally, upgrading existing facilities

95

or repurposing existing infrastructure instead of constructing new facilities or
infrastructure would support land conservation and smart growth goals.

Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gases

The measures below include some required and new potential measures to help
achieve the State’s 2030 target and to support the high-level objectives for this sector.
Some measures may be designed to directly address GHG reductions, while others
may result in GHG reductions as a co-benefit.
Ongoing and Proposed Measures
 International agreement to globally phase down HFC production were agreed
upon at the October 2016 annual Montreal Protocol Meeting of Parties in Kigali,
Rwanda.
 Depending on the level of future HFC emission reductions expected for California
from this agreement, California may also: (1) consider placing restrictions on the
sale or distribution of refrigerants with a GWP > 2,500, and (2) consider
prohibiting refrigerants with a GWP > 150 in new stationary refrigeration
equipment and refrigerants with a GWP > 750 for new stationary air-conditioning
equipment.
 Develop a regulatory monitoring, reporting, verification, and implementation
methodology for the implementation of carbon capture and sequestration
projects.
Sector Measures
 Adopt a post-2020 Cap-and-Trade Program.
 Continue and strategically expand research and development efforts to identify,
evaluate, and help deploy innovative strategies that reduce GHG emissions in
the industrial sector.
 Promote procurement policies that value low carbon production to delivery
options, including at the State and local government levels.
 Identify and remove barriers to existing grant funding for onsite clean technology
or efficiency upgrades.
 Evaluate and implement policies and measures to continue to reduce GHG,
criteria, and toxic air contaminant emissions in a cost-effective manner, focusing
on the largest GHG emission sources.
Potential Additional Actions

Transportation Sustainability

California’s population is projected to grow to 50 million people by 2050. How and
where the State grows will have important implications for all sectors of the economy,
especially the transportation sector. Supporting this growth while continuing to protect
the environment, developing livable and vibrant communities, and growing the economy
is dependent on transitioning the State’s transportation system to one powered by ZEVs
and low carbon fuels. It must also offer other attractive and convenient low carbon
transportation choices, including safe walking and bicycling, as well as quality public
transportation. Investments should consider California’s diverse communities and
provide accessible and clean travel options to all.
The transportation system in California moves people between home, work, school,
shopping, recreation, and other destinations, and connects ports, industry, residential
communities, commercial centers, educational facilities, and natural wonders. 143
California’s vast transportation system includes roads and highways totaling more than
175,000 miles and valued at approximately $1.2 trillion, 500 transit agencies,
245 public-use airports, 12 major ports, and the nation’s first high-speed rail system,
now under construction.144 Transportation infrastructure also includes sidewalks,
bicycle paths, parking, transit stations and shelters, street trees and landscaping,
signage, lighting, and other elements that affect the convenience, safety, and
accessibility of transportation choices. Increasingly, technologies such as real-time,
web- and mobile-enabled trip planning and ride-sharing services are changing how
people travel. In the near future, automated and connected vehicles, and unmanned
aerial systems (e.g., drones) are expected to be part of our transportation landscape
and to transform the way that people and freight are transported. Responsibility for the
transportation system is spread across State, regional, and local levels.
Through effective policy design, the State has an opportunity to guide technology
transformation and influence investment decisions with a view to mitigate climate and
environmental impacts while promoting economic opportunities and community health
and safety. The network of transportation technology and infrastructure, in turn, shapes

and is shaped by development and land use patterns that can either support or detract
from a more sustainable, low carbon, multi-modal transportation future. Strategies to
reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector, therefore, must actively address
not only infrastructure and technology, but also coordinated strategies to achieve
development, conservation, and land use patterns that align with the State’s GHG and
other policy goals.
Transportation also enables the movement of freight such as food, building materials,
and other consumable products. The California freight system includes myriad
equipment and facilities,145 and is the most extensive, complex, and interconnected
system in the country, with approximately 1.5 billion tons of freight valued at $2.8 trillion
shipped in 2015 to, through, and within California.146 Freight-dependent industries
accounted for over $740 billion of California’s GDP and over 5 million California jobs in
2014.147,148
Transportation has a profound and varied impact on individuals and communities,
including benefits such as economic growth, greater accessibility, and transport-related
physical activity and adverse consequences such as GHG emissions, smog-forming
and toxic air pollutants, traffic congestion, and sedentary behaviors. The sector is the
largest emitter of GHG emissions in California.149 Air pollution from tailpipe emissions
contributes to respiratory ailments, cardiovascular disease, and early death, with
disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, those
with existing health conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD),
low-income communities, and communities of color.150,151,152,153 Importantly,
transportation costs are also a major portion of most Californian’s household budgets.154
Additionally, dependence on cars has a direct impact on levels of physical activity,
which is closely linked to multiple adverse health outcomes.
Fortunately, many measures that reduce transportation sector GHG emissions
simultaneously present opportunities to bolster the economy, enhance public health,
revitalize disadvantaged communities, strengthen resilience to disasters and changing
climate, and improve Californians’ ability to conveniently access daily destinations and
145

The freight system includes trucks, ocean-going vessels, locomotives, aircraft, transport refrigeration units, commercial
harborcraft and cargo handling, industrial and ground service equipment used to move freight at seaports, airports, border
crossings, railyards, warehouses, and distribution centers.

nature. There opportunities are particularly important for those who are not able to, or
cannot afford to, drive. In addition, a growing market demand for walkable, bikeable,
and transit-accessible communities presents a significant opportunity to shift California’s
transportation systems toward a lower-carbon future while realizing significant public
health benefits through increased levels of physical activity (i.e., walking and bicycling).
In fact, transport-related physical activity could result in reducing risks from chronic
diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and more, to such
an extent that it would rank among the top public health accomplishments in modern
history, and help to reduce the billions of dollars California spends each year to treat
chronic diseases. Just as California was the first to mitigate the contribution of cars and
trucks to urban smog, it is leading the way toward a clean, low carbon, healthy,
interconnected, and equitable transportation system.
Continuing to advance the significant progress already underway in the areas of vehicle
and fuel technology is critical to the Transportation sector strategy and to reducing GHG
emissions in the transportation sector. The rapid technological and behavioral changes
underway with automated and connected vehicles, unmanned aerial systems, and ridesharing services are redefining the transportation sector, and should be part of the
solution for a lower carbon transportation sector. It is critical to support and accelerate
progress on transitioning to a zero carbon transportation system. The growing severity
of climate impacts, persistent public health impacts and costs from air pollution,155 and
rapid technology progress that supports the expectation that cost parity between some
ZEVs and comparable internal combustion vehicles will be attained in a few years,
underscores the need for further action on ZEVs. Therefore, CARB solicits input on
additional policies to move toward a goal of achieving 100 percent ZEV sales in the
light-duty vehicle sector. Austria, Germany, India, Netherlands, and Norway are all
taking steps to, or have indicated a desire to, move to 100 percent ZEV sales in the
2020–2030 time frame.
In addition, policies that maximize the integration of electrified rail and transit to improve
reliability and travel times, increase active transportation such as walking and bicycling,
encourage use of streets for multiple modes of transportation, improve freight efficiency
and infrastructure development, and shift demand to low carbon modes will need to play
a greater role as California strives to achieve its 2030 and 2050 climate targets.156
The State’s rail modernization program has identified critical elements of the rail
network where improvements, either in timing of service or infrastructure, provide
benefits across the entire statewide network, furthering the attractiveness of rail for a
range of trip distances.157 The State also uses the Transit and Intercity Rail Capital
Program (TIRCP) and Low Carbon Transit Operations Program (LCTOP) to provide
grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to fund transformative improvements

modernizing California’s intercity, commuter, and urban rail systems, as well as bus and
ferry transit systems, to reduce emissions of GHGs by reducing congestion and VMT
throughout California. As the backbone of an electrified mass-transportation network for
the State, the high-speed rail system catalyzes and relies on focused, compact, and
walkable development well-served by local transit to funnel riders onto the system and
provide alternative options to airplanes and automobiles for interregional travel.
Concentrated development, such as that incentivized by the Affordable Housing and
Sustainable Communities (AHSC) grant program, can improve ridership and revenue
for the system while providing vibrant communities for all.2
While most of the GHG reductions from the transportation sector in this Proposed Plan
will come from technologies and low carbon fuels, a reduction in the growth of VMT is
also needed. VMT reductions are necessary to achieve the 2030 target and must be
part of any strategy evaluated in this plan. Stronger SB 375 GHG reduction targets will
enable the State to make significant progress toward this goal, but alone will not provide
all of the VMT growth reductions that will be needed. There is a gap between what
SB 375 can provide and what is needed to meet the State’s 2030 and 2050 goals.
More needs to be done to fully exploit synergies with emerging mobility solutions like
ridesourcing and more effective infrastructure planning to anticipate and guide the
necessary changes in travel behavior, especially among millennials. Uniquely, highspeed rail also affects air-miles traveled, diverting, at minimum, 30 percent of the
intrastate air travel market in 2040.158
In September 2016, the Administration released a discussion document entitled “Vibrant
Communities and Landscapes”159 that set out potential actions that can be taken in
parallel to SB 375 Sustainable Community Strategies by State government, regional
planning agencies, and local governments, to achieve a broad, statewide vision for
more sustainable land use. The document “Potential VMT Reduction Strategies for
Discussion” in Appendix C further details State-level strategies that could be employed
to close the VMT gap.160 Discussions among a broad suite of stakeholders from the
building community, financial institutions, housing advocates, environmental
organizations, and community groups are needed to develop a set of strategies to
ensure that we can achieve necessary VMT reductions, and that the associated benefits
are shared by all Californians.
At the State level, a number of important policies are being developed. Governor Brown
signed Senate Bill 743 (Steinberg, Chapter 386, Statutes of 2013), which called for an
update to the metric of transportation impact in the CEQA. That update to the CEQA
Guidelines is currently underway. Employing VMT as the metric of transportation
impact statewide will help to ensure GHG reductions planned under SB 375 will be
achieved through on-the-ground development, and will also play an important role in

creating the additional GHG reductions needed beyond SB 375 across the State.
Implementation of this change will rely, in part, on local land use decisions to reduce
GHG emissions associated with the transportation sector, both at the project level, and
in long-term plans (including general plans, climate action plans, specific plans, and
transportation plans) and supporting sustainable community strategies developed under
SB 375. The State can provide guidance and tools to assist local governments in
achieving those objectives.
1.

Looking to the Future

This section outlines the high-level objectives and goals to reduce GHGs in this sector.
Vibrant Communities and Landscapes / VMT Reduction Goals
 Update the CEQA metric of transportation impact from level of service (LOS) to
VMT statewide.
 Promote all feasible policies to reduce VMT, including:
o Land use and community design that reduce VMT,
o Transit oriented development,
o Street design policies that prioritize transit, biking, and walking, and
o Increasing low carbon mobility choices, including improved access to
viable and affordable public transportation and active transportation
opportunities.
 Complete the construction of high-speed rail integrated with enhanced rail and
transit systems throughout the State.
 Promote transportation fuel system infrastructure for electric, fuel-cell, and other
emerging clean technologies that is accessible to the public where possible.
 Increase the number, safety, connectivity, and attractiveness of biking and
walking facilities to increase use.
 Promote potential efficiency gains from automated transportation systems and
identify policy priorities to maximize sustainable outcomes from automated and
connected vehicles (preferably ZEVs), including VMT reduction, coordination with
transit, and shared mobility.
 Promote shared-use mobility, such as bike sharing, car sharing and ridesharing
services to bridge the “first mile, last mile” gap between commuters’ transit stops
and their destinations.
 Continue research and development on transportation system infrastructure,
including:
o Integrate frameworks for lifecycle analysis of GHG emissions with life-cycle
costs for pavement and large infrastructure projects, and
o Health benefits and costs savings from shifting from driving to walking,
bicycling, and transit use.
 Quadruple the proportion of trips taken by foot by 2030 (from a baseline of the
2010–2012 California Household Travel Survey).
 Strive for a nine-fold increase in the proportion of trips taken by bicycle by 2030
(from a baseline of the 2010–2012 California Household Travel Survey).
101



Strive, in passenger rail hubs, for a transit mode share of between 10 percent
and 50 percent and for a walk and bike mode share of between 10 percent and
15 percent.

Vehicle Technology Goals
 Through a strong set of complementary policies—including reliable incentives,
significant infrastructure investment, broad education and outreach, and potential
regulation—aim to reach 100 percent ZEV sales.
 Make significant progress in ZEV penetrations in non-light-duty segments.
 Deploy low-emission and electrified rail vehicles.
Clean Fuels Goals
 Electrify the transportation sector using both electricity and hydrogen.
 Promote research development and deployment of low carbon fuels such as
RNG and renewable hydrogen.
 Rapidly reduce carbon intensity of existing liquid and gaseous transportation
fuels.
Sustainable Freight Goals
 Increase freight system efficiency of freight operations at specific facilities and
along freight corridors such that more cargo can be moved with fewer emissions.
 Accelerate use of clean vehicle and equipment technologies and fuels of freight
through targeted introduction of zero emission or near-zero emission (ZE/NZE)
technologies, and continued development of renewable fuels.
 Encourage State and federal incentive programs to continue supporting zero and
near-zero pilot and demonstration projects.
Accelerate use of clean vehicle and equipment technologies and fuels of freight through
targeted introduction of ZE/NZE technologies, and continued development of renewable
fuels. This includes developing policy options that encourage ZE/NZE vehicles on
primary freight corridors (e.g., I-710); examples of such policy options include a
separated ZE/NZE freight lane, employing market mechanisms such as favorable road
pricing for ZE/NZE vehicles, and developing fuel storage and distribution infrastructure
along those corridors.
2.

Cross-Sector Interactions

The Transportation sector has considerable influence on other sectors and industries in
the State. California’s transportation sector is still primarily powered by petroleum, and
to reduce statewide emissions, California must reduce demand for driving; continue to
reduce its gasoline and diesel fuel consumption; diversify its transportation fuel sources
by increasing the adoption of low- and zero-carbon fuels; increase the ease and
integration of the rail and transit networks to shift travel mode; and deploy ZE/NZE
vehicles.

102

As California’s population continues to increase, the location and types of future land
use development will directly impact GHG emissions from the transportation sector, as
well as those associated with the conversion and development of previously
undeveloped land. Specifically, where and how the State population grows will have
implications on distances traveled and tailpipe emissions; as well as on “secondary”
emissions from the transportation sector, including emissions from vehicle
manufacturing and distribution, fuel refining and distribution, demand for new
infrastructure (including roads, transit, and active transportation infrastructure), demand
for maintenance and upkeep of existing infrastructure, and conversion of natural and
working lands, with the attendant impacts to food security, watershed health, and
ecosystems. Less dense development also demands higher energy and water use.
With the exception of VMT reductions, none of these “secondary” emissions are
currently accounted for in the GHG models used in this Proposed Plan, but are
nonetheless important considerations. Additionally, compact, lower-VMT future
development patterns are essential to achieving public health, equity, economic, and
conservation goals, which are also not modeled but are important co-benefits of the
overall transportation sector strategy. For example, high-speed rail station locations
were identified to reinforce existing city centers.
Achieving LCFS targets and shifting from petroleum dependence toward greater
reliance on low carbon fuels also has the potential to affect land use in multiple ways.
For example, increased demand for conventional biofuels could require greater use of
land and water for purpose-grown crops, which includes interactions with the
agricultural and natural and working lands sectors. On the other hand, continuing
growth in fuels from waste biomass such as by-processing residues and agricultural
waste and excess forest biomass acts to alleviate the pressure on croplands to meet
the need for food, feed, and fuel. Likewise, captured methane from landfills or dairy
farms for use in vehicles requires close interaction with the waste and farming sectors.
Also, as more electric vehicles and charging stations are deployed, drivers’ charging
behavior will affect the extent to which additional electric generation capacity and
ancillary services are needed to maintain a reliable grid and accommodate a portfolio of
50 percent renewable electricity by 2030. Charging control and optimization
technologies will determine how well integrated the electric and transportation sectors
can become, including, for instance, the widespread use of electric vehicles as storage
for excess renewable generation, vehicle to grid, smart charging, and/or smart grid.
The GHG emissions intensity of electricity affects the GHG savings of fuel switching
from petroleum-based fuels to electricity; the cleaner the electric grid, the greater the
benefits of switching to electricity as a fuel. Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles can help expand
renewable energy production, but may require additional electric generation capacity to
accommodate the energy demand associated with hydrogen production and may
require more fuel storage and pipeline infrastructure.








Develop a set of complementary policies to make light-duty ZEVs clear market
winners, with a goal of reaching 100 percent light-duty ZEV sales. This could
include the following:
o Reliable purchase/trade-in incentives for at least 10 years.
o Dealer incentives for ZEV sales.
o Policies to ensure operating cost savings for ZEVs relative to internal
combustion engines, including low cost, and potentially free, electricity.

policies for ZEVs.
o Targeted policies to support ZEV sales and use in low income and
disadvantaged communities.
Develop a Low Emission Diesel Standard to diversify the fuel pool by
incentivizing increased production of low-emission diesel fuels. This standard
would require incremental progress toward a goal of low-emission diesel
comprising 50 percent of the on-and off-road diesel sold in-state by 2030.
Stabilize transportation funding so investments are available to develop
sustainable and well-maintained multi-modal transportation networks in
California.
Continue to develop and explore pathways to implement State-level VMT
reduction strategies, such as those outlined in the document “Potential StateLevel Strategies to Advance Sustainable, Equitable Communities and Reduce
Vehicle Miles of Travel (VMT) for Discussion”162 (included in Appendix C) through
a transparent and inclusive interagency policy development process to evaluate
and identify implementation pathways for additional policies to reduce VMT and
promote sustainable communities, with a focus on the following:

planning, designing, building, operating, maintaining, and investing in
State infrastructure.

D.

Natural and Working Lands Including Agricultural Lands

In his 2015 State of the State address, Governor Brown established 2030 targets for
GHG emission reductions and called for policies and actions to reduce GHG emissions
from natural and working lands, including forests, rangelands, farms, wetlands, and
soils. This policy objective was codified through passage of SB 1386 in 2016. The
2030 Target Scoping Plan focuses renewed attention on California's natural and
working lands and the contribution they make to meet the State’s long-term goals for
carbon sequestration, GHG reduction, and climate change adaptation.
California’s natural and working lands encompass a range of land types and uses,
including farms, ranches, forests, grasslands, deserts, wetlands, riparian areas, coastal
areas and the ocean-- as well as the green spaces in urban and built environments.
These lands provide significant environmental and public health benefits to the State,
and they support clean air, wildlife and pollinator habitat, and strong economies. They
are home to the largest and most diverse sources of food and fiber production and
renewable energy in the United States. And, they are the foundation of the State’s
water supply, with more than two-thirds of California’s water supply originating in the
Sierra Nevada.163
Policy in this sector must balance carbon sequestration with other co-benefits.
California’s climate objective for natural and working lands is to maintain them as a
carbon sink (i.e., net zero or even negative GHG emissions) and minimize the net GHG
163

www.sierranevada.ca.gov/our-region/ca-primary-watershed

107

and black carbon emissions associated with management, biomass utilization, and
wildfire events. The State’s lands, as well as sub-tidal waters, can be both a source and
sink for GHG emissions. The carbon contained in vegetation and soils represents the
accumulated exchange of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.
CARB has worked extensively with other State agencies, academic researchers and the
public to quantify the individual components of the Natural and Working Lands
inventory. Recent work has focused on estimating the 2001- 2010 total carbon and
carbon fluxes for forests in California. The initial results from this work show that, for
2010, California’s natural lands contained an estimated 898 million metric tons of
carbon (MMT C) in above-ground live stock for all natural lands combined (forest,
grasslands, wetlands and other natural lands), and an additional 1,603 MMT C in
additional pools included in the Natural and Working Lands inventory. 164 CARB
continues to expand the scope of the inventory using the most recent data available and
plans to update the forest component of the Natural and Working Lands (to include
2012 GHG emissions estimates) inventory next year, followed by emissions estimates
for soil carbon, urban forestry, and croplands by mid-2018. Work currently in progress
applies airborne and space-based technologies to monitor forest health and quantify
emissions associated with land-based carbon. Remote sensing technology is maturing
rapidly. California and federal agencies are working with researchers and funding
studies to enhance our understanding of the roles of forests and other lands in climate
change using this advanced technology.165,166 CARB is continuously reviewing the
latest science in this sector and is committed to working closely with other State
agencies and the public to ensure a comprehensive review of the updates to the
inventory.
While not all of this stored carbon is in imminent danger of emission to the atmosphere,
recent trends indicate that significant pools of carbon risk reversal: an estimated
150 MMT C was lost to disturbance over the period 2001–2010, with the majority—
approximately 120 MMT C—lost through wildland fire. At the same time, energy use,
methane, and N2O emissions from the agricultural sector accounts for 8 percent of the
emissions in the statewide GHG inventory. While growing trees and other vegetation,
as well as soil carbon sequestration, make up for some of these losses, climate change
itself is expected to further stress many of these systems and affect the ability of
California’s landscapes to maintain its carbon sink without proactive management.
There are ways to slow and reverse this trend, in concert with other productive and
ecological objectives of land use, and the State will continue to rely on best available
science to promote those actions. These efforts can not only protect California’s natural
carbon stocks, they can also improve quality of life in urban and rural communities alike
and increase the climate resilience of agricultural, forestry, and recreational industries
and the rural communities they support; the State’s water supply; biodiversity; and the
safety and environmental health of all who call California home.

This Proposed Plan includes an initial analysis of business-as-usual net carbon
sequestration rates from natural and working lands, including forecasts to 2030 and
2050. This is being done outside of the PATHWAYS model used for the other sectors
in the Proposed Plan through a research contract with Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory that is managed by the California Natural Resources Agency (CNRA).
Additional 2030 and 2050 scenarios assess the expected impact of a set of
development, land protection, management, and restoration objectives on carbon
sequestration and GHG emissions. The Discussion Draft includes more information on
the initial modeling as does Appendix G.167 These projections will continue to be
developed in the coming months. The projections will be used to estimate the
difference between current carbon sequestration levels and expected sequestration
levels in the scenarios to achieve the net zero loss goal by 2030 and net sequestration
goal by 2050. This work will help guide near and long-term State policies to ensure net
sequestration in our natural and working lands. Refinement of these projections will
need to continue after the Final Plan is adopted. These refinements will be important to
support implementation planning and to model implementation scenarios to 2100 to
better understand the response of natural and working lands to major climate change
impacts such as increased temperature, drought, and wildfire. The business-as-usual
statewide baseline emission projection and carbon sequestration results may also
inform the accounting framework requirements set forth in SB 859.
1.

Looking to the Future

This section outlines the high-level objectives to reduce GHGs in the natural and
working lands sector to meet California’s climate objective to: (1) maintain them as a
resilient carbon sink (i.e., net zero or even negative GHG emissions) to 2030 and
beyond, and (2) minimize the net GHG and black carbon emissions associated with
management, biomass disposal, and wildfire events to 2030 and beyond. Achieving
these objectives will include establishment of agriculture sector GHG emission reduction
planning targets for the mid-term time frame and 2050.
Implementation will include policy and program pathways, with activities related to land
protection; enhanced carbon sequestration; and innovative biomass utilization:
(1) Protect land from conversion to more intensified uses by increasing conservation
opportunities and pursuing local planning processes urban and infrastructure
development patterns that avoid greenfield development. The latter is being
done in coordination with transportation and infrastructure climate policy, as
described in prior sections of this Proposed Plan.
(2) Enhance the resilience of and potential for carbon sequestration on those lands
through management and restoration, and reduce GHG and black carbon
emissions from wildfire and management activities. This includes expansion and
management of green space in urban areas.
(3) Innovate biomass utilization such that harvested wood and excess agricultural
and forest biomass can be used to advance statewide objectives for renewable
167

https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/scopingplan/meetings/meetings.htm

109

energy and fuels, wood product manufacturing, agricultural markets, and soil
health, resulting in avoided GHG emissions relative to traditional utilization
pathways. Associated activities should increase the resilience of rural
communities and economies.
The Forest Climate Action Team, Healthy Soils Initiative, State Coastal Conservancy’s
Climate Ready Program, various Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs, and
CARB’s compliance offset program already undertake this work. Future work will
identify and seek to fill gaps, and set a comprehensive and strategic path forward.
Research is underway across agencies to advance the state of the science on natural
and working lands carbon dynamics, including a number of projects within the Fourth
Climate Change Assessment.

Cross-Sector Interactions

Strategies that reduce GHG emissions or increase sequestration in the natural and
working lands sector often overlap and result in synergies with other sectors, most
notably at intersections with land use, biomass and waste utilization, and water.
Landowner, local, and regional decisions affect land use development patterns and
natural and working land conversion rates; conversely, conservation activities can
support infill-oriented regional development and related transportation needs. As
discussed earlier in the Transportation Sustainability section, under SB 375,
Sustainable Communities Strategies (SCSs) aim to link transportation, housing, and
climate policy to reduce per capita GHG emissions while providing a range of other
important benefits for Californians. Some SCSs include policies, objectives or
implementation measures relating to conservation and land protections, and to urban
greening.168 Protecting natural and working lands that are under threat of conversion
can promote infill development, reduce VMT, limit infrastructure expansion, and curb
associated GHG emissions. An integrated vision for community development, land
conservation and management, and transportation was presented at the 2030 Target
Scoping Plan Workshop on September 14, 2016.169
Agricultural and commercial forestry operations produce biomass as both an objective
(i.e., food and fiber production) and a waste product. How this material is utilized can
either increase or decrease emissions associated with management and restoration
activities, turn waste into usable products, displace fossil fuels used in energy and
transportation, and increase carbon stored in durable wood products in the built
environment. Finding productive ways to use this material offers new opportunities to
reduce GHG emissions, promote carbon sequestration, and generate economic
resources for forest, agricultural, and waste sectors and communities. California is
investigating ways to transform how organic waste from the agricultural and municipal
sectors is managed to meet emission reduction targets required by SB 1383,170 and to

protect public health. Cross-sector synergies and complete waste inter-cycles,
discussed further in the Waste Management section, result from conscientious
treatment of these resources, including opportunities to improve soil health, increase
renewable energy generation, and enhance market support for non-commercial
products and waste. Productive utilization of dead and dying trees is a significant focus
of the Governor’s Tree Mortality Task Force, and efforts to resolve the current shortfall
in utilization capacity is addressed in that State of Emergency Declaration as well as in
SB 859.
Natural and working lands stewardship is essential to securing the State’s water supply
along the entire supply chain, from protection and management of the forested
headwaters to preserving retention function of mountain meadows, ensuring flows and
habitat in the Delta and its tributaries, end use efficiencies in agricultural and urban
uses, and groundwater infiltration and utilization statewide. For example, efforts to
increase water and energy use efficiency of farming operations could support GHG
emission reduction goals in the energy sectors. And improving forest health in the
Sierra Nevada and other headwaters will protect water quality and availability, in
alignment with the California Water Action Plan.
a)

Agriculture’s Role in Emission Reduction and Carbon
Sequestration

As the State works to meet emission reduction goals, the agricultural sector can
contribute by reducing emissions from production and by playing a role in cross-sectoral
efforts to maximize the many benefits of natural and working lands.
Climate-smart agriculture is an integrated approach to achieving GHG reductions while
also ensuring food security in the face of climate change and promoting agricultural
adaptation to the compounding impacts of climate change. Conserving agricultural
land, sequestering carbon in agricultural soils, employing a variety of techniques to
manage manure on dairies, and increasing the efficiency of on-farm water and energy
use are examples of practices that can achieve climate and food production goals
across diverse agricultural systems. Climate-smart agriculture can support the goals of
Protect, Enhance, and Innovate. Focus areas that can lead to reduced emissions and
other co-benefits are discussed in the following paragraphs.
California agriculture accounts for 8 percent of the State’s GHG emission inventory. A
large percentage of agricultural emissions are methane emissions from the dairy and
livestock sectors. Emissions come from the animals themselves, through enteric
fermentation, as well as from manure management—especially at dairies. Senate Bill
1383 and the resultant Proposed SLCP Reduction Strategy identify a mix of voluntary,
incentive-based, and potential regulatory actions to achieve significant emissions
reductions from these sources. A variety of techniques will be employed to attain the
best results for each specific farming operation, and effectively implementing a broad
mix of strategies will reduce the GHG emissions from the agricultural sector
significantly.
111

Another source of GHG from agriculture is nitrous oxide resulting from nitrogen fertilizer
applications. Optimizing the rate, timing, placement and type of nitrogen fertilizers has
significant potential to reduce nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Reducing synthetic
nitrogen fertilizer sources by enhancing the use of organic nitrogen sources (such as
cover crops and compost) can achieve net GHG reductions as well. Over the last
several years steps have been taken to help farms optimize fertilizer applications to
protect water quality, reduce N2O emissions, and maintain high yields. Farmers are
required through the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program to manage nitrogen fertilizers
carefully to protect water quality through the use of nitrogen management plans.
Nitrogen management plans are a tool designed to prevent over-applications of nitrogen
through an approach that accounts for the nitrogen inputs from water, soil amendments
and other sources, and also accounts for nitrogen removed from the field. The
California Department of Food and Agriculture’s (CDFA’s) Fertilizer Research and
Education Program, in coordination with university researchers and others, has
developed fertilization guidelines to optimize the rate, timing and placement of fertilizers
for crops that represent more than half of the irrigated agriculture in California.
Similarly, innovations in water management and the expansion of high efficiency
irrigation methods also are contributing to N2O reductions.
California’s farms and ranches have the ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere
through practices that build and retain soil organic matter. Adequate soil organic matter
ensures the soil’s continued capacity to function as a vital living ecosystem with multiple
benefits, producing food for plants, animals, and humans. The Healthy Soils Initiative,
announced by Governor Brown in 2015, offers an opportunity to incentivize the
management of farmland for increased carbon sequestration in soil, also augmenting
co-benefits such as increased water-holding capacity and soil fertility and supporting
biodiversity and integrated farming techniques. State and local efforts to manage land
for carbon sequestration must work in conjunction with existing plans, incentives, and
programs protecting California’s water supply, agricultural lands, and wildlife habitat.
The Proposed Plan fits within a wide range of ongoing planning efforts throughout the
State to advance economic and environmental priorities associated with natural and
working lands.
3.

Potential Actions to Enhance Carbon Sequestration and
Reduce Greenhouse Gases

The land management targets outlined below are illustrative of the types of actions that
will be necessary to maintain California’s natural and working lands and urban green
space as a net sink of carbon, and are being used to aid in development of the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory scenario modeling—both the Reference
scenario and “with-policy” scenarios. Once the carbon implications of these activities
are established within that scenario modeling framework, the State and stakeholders
can begin the process of more accurately scoping the scale of action needed to reach
the carbon sequestration and GHG emission reduction targets. The preliminary
modeling results were included in the Discussion Draft and Appendix G.

112

a)

Protection of Land and Land Use

California will continue to pursue development and new infrastructure construction
patterns that avoid greenfield development, limit conflicts with neighboring land uses,
and increase conservation opportunities for natural and working lands to reduce
conversion to intensified uses. Success here will depend on working through local and
regional land use planning and permitting, as well as developing incentives for
participation by local governments and individual landowners. The preliminary modeling
results are included in Discussion Draft and Appendix G.
b)

Enhance Carbon Sequestration and Resilience through
Management and Restoration

California will increase efforts to manage and restore land to secure and increase
carbon storage and minimize GHG and black carbon emissions in a sustainable manner
so that the carbon bank is resilient over time.
To better understand the potential carbon outcomes of this strategy, the initial modeling
for this sector, as detailed in the Discussion Draft and Appendix G, considers a variety
of management and restoration activities employed across the State. The model
considers two potential scenarios, a “low” and a “high” rate of implementation to 2030,
with resulting carbon sequestration outcomes to 2050. The acreages given in the “low”
scenario all represent implementation above and beyond current rates for the listed
activity, but that could be considered reasonably achievable if additional funding and
other supporting resources are available. This applies to implementation on both
private and public lands. Many of these goals can be accomplished through existing
administrative structures, but will require additional public and private investment. The
“high” scenario includes more ambitious targets, and may entail new programs and
policies, including additional coordination with federal partners, to support
implementation. Details about the modeling are included in the Discussion Draft and
Appendix G.
The activities presented in Discussion Draft and Appendix G as part of the initial
modeling are not inclusive of all activities that will be considered under this strategy.
The modeled management strategies were included because well-established science
indicates that the strategies increase carbon sequestration and resilience. For example,
an increase in urban tree canopy is included in the initial modeling exercise though
urban greening initiatives will not be limited to tree planting. State agencies seek input
through this Scoping Plan process on the suite of activities to be considered under this
strategy to improve modeling and projections. Because modeling will need to continue
beyond finalization of the Final Plan, actions to reduce emissions and increase carbon
sequestration for this sector include next steps to identify and analyze land
management and restoration activities to advance the State’s climate objectives and
improvements in modeling projections or other quantification protocols.

113

Management and restoration activities to be considered beyond those included in the
initial modeling include, but are not limited to the following:
 Improved forest management such as forest fuel reduction treatments,
reforestation, other restoration activities, prescribed fire and managed ignition.
 Restoration of mountain meadows, managed wetlands in the Sacramento San
Joaquin Delta, coastal wetlands and desert habitat.
 Increased extent of eelgrass beds.
 Creation and management of parks and other greenspace in urban areas,
including expansion of the existing urban tree canopy.
 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resource Conservation Service
(NRCS) management practices suitable for California agriculture.
The Discussion Draft includes additional information about the initial modeling inputs,
assumptions, and results.
State agencies will require additional resources to complete efforts to model projections
for this sector.
c)

Innovate Biomass Utilization Pathways

Excess biomass generated by commercial agricultural and forestry operations, biomass
and wood harvested through forest health and restoration treatments, and material that
is generated in response to Tree Mortality Emergency activities, should be used in a
manner that minimizes GHG and black carbon emissions and promotes public and
environmental health. The legislature has called for reducing disposal of organic waste
in landfills, including millions of tons of wood and green waste that can be composted or
turned into other products, fuels, and electricity. The State must develop targeted
policies or incentives to support durable markets for all of this material. Achieving this
outcome will require diversion of this biomass to production of renewable electricity and
biofuels, commercial products including durable wood products, compost and other soil
amendments, animal feed and bedding, and other uses. Research, development, and
implementation activities underway in energy, wood products, and soil amendment
fields should be evaluated for utility in optimizing these resources on regional and
community scales.
4.

Efforts to Support Sector Objectives

To ensure the natural and working lands sector is a net carbon sink, the State will
complete an Integrated Natural and Working Lands Climate Change Action Plan by
2018. Modeling efforts currently underway with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
and additional modeling efforts, as needed, will support the development of this plan.
This plan will consider aggregation of eco-regional plans and efforts to achieve net
sequestration goals. The following list includes additional efforts that support this
sector’s goals, many of which will be included in the Action Plan.

structures, and include mandated programs, voluntary efforts, and state,
local, regional and federal partnerships with the U.S. Forest Service and
USDA NRCS, among others.

CalEPA’s Urban Heat Island Index Maps acts as a tool to establish baselines for 31 urban areas. The Index is calculated as a
positive temperature differential over time between an urban census tract and nearby upwind rural reference points at a height of
two meters above ground level, where people experience heat. See more at:
www.calepa.ca.gov/UrbanHeat/Index.htm#sthash.SZkxGYlA.dpuf. CalEPA concludes daytime temperatures in urban areas are on
average 1°F–6°F higher than in rural areas, while nighttime temperatures can be as much as 22°F higher as the heat is gradually
released from buildings and pavement. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) encourages cities to set quantitative
goals. For example, the City of Los Angeles’s The Sustainable City pLAn aims to reduce the temperature difference between the
urban core and the surrounding rural areas by 1.7°F by 2025 and 3.0°F by 2035.

E.

Waste Management

The Waste Management sector covers all aspects of solid waste173 and materials
management including reduction/reuse; recycling, and remanufacturing of recovered
material; composting and in-vessel (anaerobic and aerobic) digestion; biomass
management (chip and grind, composting, biomass conversion); municipal solid waste
transformation; and landfilling. This sector also includes market development programs,
such as the State’s recycled-content product procurement program and a range of grant
and loan programs. Data from CalRecycle’s report, 2014 Disposal Facility-Based
Characterization of Solid waste in California, shows that materials, such as organics,
that decompose in landfills and generate methane comprise a significant portion of the
waste stream. Methane is a potent SLCP with a global warming potential 25 times
greater than that of carbon dioxide on a 100-year time horizon and more than 70 times
greater than that of carbon dioxide on a 20-year time horizon.174
Within CARB’s greenhouse gas inventory, emissions from the waste management
sector consist of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from landfills and from
commercial-scale composting, with methane being the primary contributor to the
sector’s emissions. The sector emitted 8.85 MMTCO2e in 2014, comprising
approximately 2 percent of the State’s GHG emissions.

173

In general, the term solid waste refers to garbage, refuse, sludges, and other discarded solid materials resulting from residential
activities, and industrial and commercial operations. This term generally does not include solids or dissolved material in domestic
sewage or other significant pollutants in water such as silt, dissolved or suspended solids in industrial wastewater effluents,
dissolved materials in irrigation return flows or other common water pollutants.

Emissions from recycling and waste have grown
Figure IV-3. Emissions from
by 19 percent since 2000 (Figure IV-3).175 The
Landfill and Compost
majority of those emissions are attributed to
(MMTCO2e)
landfills, despite the majority of landfills having
gas collection systems in place.176 Landfill
emissions account for 94 percent of the
emissions in this sector, while compost
production facilities make up a small fraction of
emissions.177 The annual amount of solid waste
deposited in California landfills grew from
37 million tons in 2000 to its peak of 46 million
tons in 2005, followed by a declining trend until
2009 when landfilled solid waste stabilized to
relatively constant levels. Landfill emissions are
driven by the total waste-in-place, rather than
year-to-year fluctuation in annual deposition of
solid waste, as the rate and volume of gas
produced during decomposition depends on the
characteristics of the waste and a number of environmental factors. As a result, waste
disposed in a given year contributes to emissions that year and in subsequent years.
In addition to direct emissions, the reduction, reuse, and recycling of waste materials
decreases upstream GHG emissions associated with the extraction and processing of
virgin materials and their use in production and transport of products. Although many of
these upstream GHG emissions happen outside of California, California’s waste policies
can reduce both local and global GHG emissions and create jobs within the State.
While landfills are an effective and relatively safe way to manage some waste, disposalcentric activities result in squandering valuable resources and generate landfill gases as
well as other risks. A large fraction of the organics in the waste stream can be diverted
from landfills to composting or digestion facilities to produce beneficial products.
Moreover, food waste is the largest component of organics disposed in landfills; a
portion of this is edible and should be captured at its source and, for example, provided
to food banks to feed people in need. A State waste management sector “loading
order” should focus more attention on reducing how much waste we generate and
recovering and recycling whatever resources we can, using landfills as a last resort.
Landmark initiatives like the Integrated Waste Management Act of 1989 (AB 939)
demonstrate California’s efforts to build communities that consume less, recycle more,
and take resource conservation to higher and higher levels. Statewide, Californians
achieved a 49 percent recycling rate in 2014, and recycling programs support an
estimated 75,000 to 115,000 green jobs in California. If California were to achieve a

75 percent statewide solid waste recycling rate by 2020—a goal set out by the
Legislature in AB 341 (Chesboro, Chapter 476, Statutes of 2011) —by recycling and
remanufacturing at in-state facilities, the State could potentially generate an additional
100,000 green jobs.178 In addition to employment contributions, diversion of organic
waste from landfills can generate positive environmental impacts. Compost from
organic matter provides soil amendments to revitalize farmland, reduces irrigation and
landscaping water demands, contributes to erosion control in fire-ravaged landscapes,
and potentially increase long-term carbon storage in rangelands. Production and use of
bioenergy in the form of biofuels and renewable natural gas has the potential to reduce
dependency on fossil fuels for the transportation sector. For the energy sector,
however, renewable natural gas faces safety, feasibility, and cost issues.
The State has a robust waste management system in place, with established programs
that reduce air emissions through activities such as gas collection systems from
landfills179 and stringent recycling mandates. AB 939 required cities and counties to
reduce the amount of waste going to landfills by 50 percent in 2000, and municipalities
have nearly universally met this mandate. Californians dispose about 30 million tons of
solid waste in landfills each year. To further reduce landfilled solid waste, the
Legislature adopted AB 341 to achieve more significant waste reductions by setting a
goal that 75 percent of solid waste generated be reduced, recycled, or composted by
2020, and by mandating commercial recycling. AB 1826 (Chesboro, Chapter 727,
Statutes of 2014) added requirements regarding mandatory commercial organics
recycling.
Although solid waste management has evolved over the last 27 years and diversion
rates (which include more than recycling) have increased more than six-fold since 1989,
if no further changes in policy are made, the State’s growing population and economy
will lead to higher amounts of overall disposal along with associated increases in GHG
emissions. The pathway to reducing disposal and associated GHG emissions will
require significant expansion of the composting, anaerobic digestion, and recycling
manufacturing infrastructure in the State.
To help reduce GHG emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030 and meet
California’s waste reduction goals, California’s waste management sector strives to
achieve in-state processing and management of waste generated in California. To
carry out this vision, we must work with residents and producers to reduce the volume
of waste generated overall and capitalize on technology and social changes that might
enable waste reduction. Packaging comprises approximately 8 million tons of waste
landfilled in California annually, or about one quarter of the State’s total disposal stream.
To reduce the climate change footprint of packaging, the State is promoting the
inclusion of source reduction principles in packaging and product design; fostering
recycling and recyclability as a front end design parameter for packaging and products

that cannot be reduced; and encouraging recycling markets and market development
for recycled-content products and packaging. CalRecycle is developing a packaging
policy model containing components necessary for a mandatory comprehensive,
statewide packaging program in California; this would need to be legislatively enacted to
achieve a packaging reduction goal, such as 50 percent by 2030. CalRecycle is also
continuing to work with stakeholder organizations and industry to explore
complementary voluntary activities that have the potential to significantly decrease
packaging disposal in California. In addition, large-scale shifts in materials
management will be necessary, including steps to maximize recycling and diversion
from landfills and build the necessary infrastructure to support a sustainable, low carbon
waste management system within California. Working together, State and local
agencies will identify ways to increase the use of waste diversion alternatives and
expand potential markets, obtain funds and incentives for building the infrastructure and
strengthening markets, and evaluate the need for additional research to achieve
California’s GHG reduction and waste management goals.
Recently adopted legislation outlines new opportunities and requirements to reduce
GHG emissions from the waste sector, with a focus on reducing organic waste sent to
landfills. SB 605 (Lara, Chapter 523, Statutes of 2014) requires that CARB develop a
strategy to reduce SLCPs and SB 1383 requires the strategy to be implemented by
January 1, 2018. CARB’s Proposed SLCP Reduction Strategy includes organic waste
diversion targets for 2020 and 2025 consistent with SB 1383 to reduce methane
emissions from landfills. It requires CalRecycle, in consultation with CARB, to adopt
regulations to achieve statewide disposal targets to reduce landfilling of organic waste
by: (1) 50 percent from the 2014 level by 2020, and (2) 75 percent from the 2014 level
by 2025. Under SB 1383, of the edible food destined for the organic waste stream, not
less than 20 percent is to be recovered to feed people in need by 2025. The regulations
are to take effect on or after January 1, 2022, and CalRecycle, in consultation with
CARB, must analyze the progress that the waste management sector, State
government, and local government have made in achieving the 2020 and 2025 goals by
July 1, 2020. Incorporating SB 1383 requirements, CARB’s Final SLCP Reduction
Strategy is expected to be presented to the Board for approval in the first quarter of
2017. It is estimated that the combined effect of the food waste prevention and rescue
programs and organics diversion from landfills will reduce 4 MMTCO2e of methane in
2030 (using a 20-year GWP), but one year of waste diversion in 2030 is expected to
result in a reduction of 14 MMTCO2e of emissions over the lifetime of waste
decomposition.

Looking to the Future

This section outlines the high-level objectives and goals to reduce GHGs in this sector.
Goals

Cross-Sector Interactions

The waste management sector interacts with all of the other sectors of the State’s
economy. Reducing waste, including food waste, is key to reducing the State’s overall
carbon footprint. Additionally, replacing virgin materials with recycled materials reduces
the energy and GHGs associated with the goods we produce and consume.
California leads the United States in agricultural production in terms of value and crop
diversity. Soil carbon is the main source of energy for important soil microbes and is
key for making nutrients available to plants. Waste-derived compost and other organic
soil amendments support the State’s Healthy Soils Initiative being implemented by
CDFA. In addition, the use of compost to increase soil organic matter in the agricultural
sector provides other benefits, including reduced GHG emissions, conserved water,
reduced synthetic (petroleum-based) fertilizer and herbicide use, and sequestered
carbon.
3.

Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gases

The measures below include some required and new potential measures to help
achieve the State’s 2030 target and to support the high-level objectives for this sector.
Some measures may be designed to directly address GHG reductions, while others
may result in GHG reductions as a co-benefit. In addition, to move forward with the
goals of the waste management sector and achieve the 2030 target, certain actions are
recommended to help set the groundwork. These actions affect several broad areas
and are necessary for reducing the challenges facing this sector, and they are listed
below as supporting actions.

180

Examples may include renewable energy (biogas to renewable transportation fuels or electricity); soils (application of organics to
agricultural soils for building soil organic matter and conserving water; application of organics to mulch for erosion control;
application of organics to rangelands for increased carbon sequestration); and forests (support use of forest residues for erosion
control; stabilization of fire-ravaged lands).

122

Ongoing and Proposed Measures
 Continue implementation of the Landfill Methane Control Measure.
 Continue implementation of the Mandatory Commercial Recycling Regulation
and the Mandatory Commercial Organics Recycling requirements.
 As required by SB 1383:
o By 2018, CARB will adopt and implement the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant
Reduction Strategy.
o CalRecycle will develop regulations to require 50 percent organic waste
diversion from landfills from 2014 levels by 2020 and 75 percent by 2025,
including programs to achieve an edible food waste recovery goal of
20 percent below 2016 levels by 2025. The regulations shall take effect on or
after January 1, 2022. By July 1, 2020, analyze the progress that the waste
sector, State government, and local governments have made in achieving
these goals.
o CEC will develop recommendations for the development and use of
renewable gas as part of the 2017 Integrated Energy Policy Report. Based
on these recommendations, adopt policies and incentives to significantly
increase sustainable production and use of renewable gas.
Potential Additional or Supporting Action
The actions below have the potential to reduce GHGs and complement the measures
and policies identified in Chapter ll. These are included to spur thinking and exploration
of innovation that may help the State achieve its long-term climate goals.
 Establishing a sustainable State funding source (such as an increased landfill tip
fee and new generator charge) for development of waste management
infrastructure, programs, and incentives.
 Working with residents and producers to reduce the volume of waste generated
overall and capitalize on technology and social changes that might enable waste
reduction.
 Increasing organics diversion from landfills, building on established mandates
(AB 341’s 75 percent by 2020 solid waste diversion goal, AB 1594,181
AB 1826,182 AB 876183) and new short-lived climate pollutant targets for 2025
(SB 605, SB 1383) to be accomplished via prevention (including food rescue),
recycling, composting/digestion, and biomass options.
 Addressing challenges and issues associated with significant expansion and
construction of organics and recycling infrastructure in California that is needed
to achieve recycling and diversion goals. Challenges and issues include
permitting, grid/pipeline connection, funding, local siting, markets, and research.
 Developing programmatic Environmental Impact Reports (EIRs) and model
permit and guidance documents to assist in environmental review and CEQA for
new facilities.
 Providing incentives for expanded and new facilities to handle organics and
recyclables to meet 2020 and 2030 goals.

Water

Water is essential to all life, and is vital to our overall health and well-being. A reliable,
clean, and abundant supply of water is also a critical component of California’s
economy and has particularly important connections to energy, food, and the
environment. California’s water system includes a complex infrastructure that has been
developed to support the capture, use, conveyance, storage, conservation, and
treatment of water and wastewater. This elaborate network of storage and delivery
systems enables the State to prosper and support populations, amidst wide variability in
annual precipitation rates and concentration of rain north of Sacramento, through
storing and moving water when and where it is needed.
Local water agencies play an important role in delivering water to communities, farms,
and businesses. Some purchase water from the major State and federal projects, treat
the water as needed, and deliver it to their customers; others act as wholesale agencies
that buy or import water and sell it to retail water suppliers. Some agencies operate
their own local water supply systems, including reservoirs and canals that store and
move water as needed. Many agencies rely on groundwater exclusively, and operate
local wells and distribution systems. In recent decades, local agencies have developed
more diversified sources of water supplies. Many agencies use a combination of
imported surface water and local groundwater, and also produce or purchase recycled
water for end uses such as landscape irrigation.184

184

124

The State’s developed surface and groundwater resources support a variety of
residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural activities. California's rapidly
growing population—estimated to reach 44 million by 2030185—is putting mounting
pressure on the water supply system. In the future, the ability to meet most new
demand for water will come from a combination of increased conservation and water
use efficiency, improved coordination of management of surface and groundwater,
recycled water, new technologies in drinking water treatment, groundwater remediation,
and brackish and seawater desalination.186
One of the State’s largest uses of energy is attributed to several aspects of the water life
cycle, including treatment, heating, and conveyance of water. As shown in Figure IV-4,
overall, 10 percent of the State’s energy use is associated with water-related end uses,
while water and wastewater systems account for 2 percent of the State’s energy use.187
Therefore, as water demand grows, energy demand may increase concurrently.
Population growth drives demand for both water and energy resources, so both grow at
about the same rates and in many of the same geographic areas.188 This dynamic is
further exacerbated by the precipitation-population mismatch between Northern and
Southern California.
The principal source of GHG emissions from the water sector comes from the fossil
fuel-based energy used to “produce” (e.g., pump, convey, treat) water and the fossil
fuel-based energy consumed for water end uses (e.g., heating). Therefore, emission
reduction strategies are primarily associated with reducing the energy intensity of the
water sector. Energy intensity is a measure of the amount of energy required to take a
unit of water from its origin (such as
Figure IV-4. Energy Use Related to Water
a river or aquifer) and extract and
189
convey it to its end use.
Within
California, the energy intensity of
water varies greatly depending on
the geography and water source.
The California Department of Water
Resources (DWR) subdivides the
State into 10 regions corresponding
to the State’s major drainage basins.
An interactive map on the DWR
website allows users to see a
summary of the energy intensity of

A broader definition of energy intensity could consider the “downstream” energy (i.e., wastewater treatment) as well as the
upstream components. More robust data are needed, and the State is working to better quantify these upstream and downstream
emissions.
186

125

regional water supplies.190 As the energy sector is decarbonized through measures
such as increased renewable energy and improved efficiency, energy intensities will
also be reduced. It is also important to note that end user actions to reduce water
consumption or replace fresh water with recycled water do not automatically translate
into GHG reductions. The integrated nature of the water supply system means that a
reduction by one end user can be offset by an increase in consumption by another user.
Likewise, use of recycled water has the potential to reduce GHGs if it replaces, and not
merely serves as an alternative to, an existing, higher-carbon water supply.
The State is currently implementing several targeted, agricultural, urban, and industrialbased water conservation, recycling, and water use efficiency programs as part of an
integrated water management effort that will help achieve GHG reductions through
reduced energy demand within the water sector.
While it is important for every sector to contribute to the State’s climate goals, ensuring
universal access to clean water as outlined in AB 685 (Eng, Chapter 524, Statutes of
2012), also known as the “human right to water” bill, should take precedence over
achieving GHG emission reductions from water sector activities where a potential
conflict exists. AB 685 states that it is the policy of the State that “every human being
has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human
consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes.” As described in this section, water
supplies vary in energy intensity and resulting GHGs, depending on the source of the
water, treatment requirements, and location of the end user.
1.

Looking to the Future

This section outlines the high-level objectives and goals to reduce GHGs in this sector.
Goals
 Develop and support more reliable water supplies for people, agriculture, and the
environment, provided by a more resilient, diversified, sustainably managed
water resources system with a focus on actions that provide direct GHG
reductions.
 Make conservation a California way of life by using and reusing water more
efficiently through greater water conservation, drought tolerant landscaping,
stormwater capture, water recycling, and reuse to help meet future water
demands and adapt to climate change.
 Develop and support programs and projects that increase water sector energy
efficiency and reduce GHG emissions through reduced water and energy use.
 Increase the use of renewable energy to pump, convey, treat, and utilize water.
 Reduce the carbon footprint of water systems and water uses for both surface
and groundwater supplies through integrated strategies that reduce GHG
emissions while meeting the needs of a growing population, improving public

safety, fostering environmental stewardship, aiding in adaptation to climate
change, and supporting a stable economy.
2.

Cross-Sector Interactions

Water, energy, food, and ecosystems are inextricably linked, and meeting future climate
challenges will require an integrated approach to managing the resources in these
sectors.
Water is used in various applications in the energy sector, ranging in intensity from
cooling of turbines and other equipment at power plants to cleaning solar photovoltaic
panels. In 2003, CEC adopted a water conservation policy for power plants to limit the
use of freshwater for power plant cooling, and has since encouraged project owners
proposing to build new power plants in California to reduce water consumption with
water-efficiency technologies such as dry cooling and to conserve fresh water by using
recycled water. Likewise, energy is used in multiple ways and at multiple steps in water
delivery and treatment systems, including energy for treating and delivering drinking
water; heating and chilling water; conveying water; extracting groundwater; desalination;
pressurizing water for irrigation; and wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal.
Although GHG reduction strategies for the water sector have the closest ties to energy,
the water sector also interacts with the natural and working lands, agricultural, waste
management, and transportation sectors. Water flows from mountains to downstream
regions through natural and working lands, which provide habitat for many species and
function to store water, recharge groundwater, naturally purify water, and moderate
flooding. Protection of key lands from conversion results in healthier watersheds by
reducing polluted runoff and maintaining a properly functioning ecosystem. California is
the United States’ leading agricultural production state in terms of value and crop
diversity. Approximately nine million acres of farmland in California are irrigated. 191
In addition, water use is associated with livestock watering, feedlots, dairy operations,
and other on-farm needs. Altogether, agriculture uses about 40 percent of the State’s
managed water supply.192 In the end, agricultural products produced in California are
consumed by humans throughout the world as food, fiber, and fuel. Wastewater
treatment plants provide a complementary opportunity for the waste management
sector to help process organic waste diversion from landfills. Treatment plants with
spare capacity can potentially accommodate organic waste for anaerobic co-digestion
of materials such as food waste and fats, oil, and grease from residential, commercial,
or industrial facilities to create useful by-products such as electricity, biofuels, and soil
amendments. The water sector is also essential to our community health and long-term
well-being, and measures must ensure that we continue to have access to clean and
reliable sources of drinking water. Climate change threatens to impact our water
supplies, for example, with long-term droughts leading to wells and other sources of

192
Applied water use is the official terminology used by DWR. “Applied water refers to the total amount of water that is diverted from
any source to meet the demands of water users without adjusting for water that is used up, returned to the developed supply, or
considered irrecoverable.”

127

water running dry. This can have devastating consequences, especially on
communities already vulnerable and sensitive to changes in their water supply and
natural hydrological systems, including rural communities who have limited options for
water supplies. Water conservation and management strategies that are energy
efficient can also ensure a continued supply of water for our health and well-being.
3.

Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gases

The measures below include some required and new potential measures to help
achieve the State’s 2030 target and to support the high-level objectives for this sector.
Some measures may be designed to directly address GHG reductions, while others
may result in GHG reductions as a co-benefit. In addition, several recommended
actions are identified to help the water sector move forward with the identified goals and
measures to achieve the 2030 target; these are listed as supporting actions.
Ongoing and Proposed Measures
 As directed by Governor Brown’s Executive Order B-37-16, DWR and State
Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) will develop and implement new water
use targets to generate more statewide water conservation than existing targets
(the existing State law requires a 20 percent reduction in urban water use by
2020 [SBx7-7, Steinberg, Chapter 4, Statutes of 2009]). The new water use
targets will be based on strengthened standards for indoor use, outdoor
irrigation, commercial, industrial, and institutional water use.
 SWRCB will develop long-term water conservation regulation, and permanently
prohibit practices that waste potable water.
 DWR and SWRCB will develop and implement actions to minimize water system
leaks, and to set performance standards for water loss, as required by SB 555
(Wolk, Chapter 679, Statutes of 2015).
 DWR and CDFA will update existing requirements for agricultural water
management plans to increase water system efficiency.
 CEC will certify innovative technologies for water conservation and water loss
detection and control.
 CEC will continue to update the State’s Appliance Efficiency Regulations
(California Code of Regulations, Title 20, Sections 1601–1608) for appliances
offered for sale in California to establish standards that reduce energy
consumption for devices that use electricity, gas, and/or water.
 California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) will oversee development
of a registry for GHG emissions resulting from the water-energy nexus, as
required by SB 1425 (Pavley, Chapter 596, Statutes of 2016).
 The State Water Project has entered long-term contracts to procure renewable
electricity from 140 MW solar installations in California.
 As described in its Climate Action Plan, DWR will continue to increase the use of
renewable energy to operate the State Water Project.
Overall, these actions will contribute to the broader energy efficiency goals discussed in
the Low Carbon Energy section of this chapter.
128

Potential Additional or Supporting Action
The actions below have the potential to reduce GHGs and complement the measures
and policies identified in Chapter ll. These are included to spur thinking and exploration
of innovation that may help the State achieve its long-term climate goals.








Local water and wastewater utilities should adopt a long-term goal to reduce
GHGs by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 (consistent with DWR’s Climate
Action Plan), and thereafter move toward low carbon or net-zero carbon water
management systems where technically feasible and cost-effective.
Local water and wastewater utilities should develop distributed renewable energy
where feasible, using the expanded Local Government Renewable Energy Bill
Credit (RES-BCT) tariff and new Net Energy Metering (which allow for installation
without system size limit).
In support of the Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Strategy, encourage resource
recovering wastewater treatment projects to help achieve the goal of reducing
fugitive methane by 40 percent by 2030, to include:
o Determining opportunities to support co-digestion of food-related waste
streams at wastewater treatment plants.
o Incentivizing methane capture systems at wastewater treatment plants to
produce renewable electricity, transportation fuel, or pipeline biomethane.
Support compact development and land use patterns, and associated
conservation and management strategies for natural and working lands that
reduce per capita water consumption through more water-efficient built
environments.

129

V.

Achieving Success

Meeting, and exceeding, our mandated GHG reduction goals in 2020 and through 2030
requires building on California’s decade of success in implementing effective climate
policies. State agencies are increasingly coordinating planning activities to align with
overarching climate, clean air, social equity, and broader economic objectives.
However, to definitely tip the scales in favor of rapidly declining emissions, we also need
to reach beyond State policy-making and engage all Californians. Further progress can
be made by supporting innovative actions at the local level—among governments, small
businesses, schools, and individual households. Ultimately, success depends on a mix
of regulatory program development, incentives, institutional support, and education and
outreach to ensure that clean energy and other climate strategies are clear, winning
alternatives in the marketplace—to drive business development and consumer
adoption.

A.

Enabling Local Action

Local governments are essential partners in achieving California’s goals to reduce GHG
emissions. They can implement climate strategies to address local conditions and
issues, and they can often more effectively engage citizens than the State can. They
have broad jurisdiction—and in some cases, unique authorities—through communityscale planning and permitting processes, discretionary actions, local codes and
ordinances, outreach and education efforts, and municipal operations. And local
jurisdictions often develop new, innovative approaches to reduce emissions that are
then adopted elsewhere. Their efforts are critical to supporting the State’s efforts to
reduce emissions and can ultimately deliver additional GHG and criteria emissions
reductions beyond what State policy can, along with local economic benefits.
Many cities and counties are already setting GHG reduction targets, developing climate
action plans, and making progress toward reducing emissions. Climate action plans
allow a local government or region to look holistically at their GHG emissions and
develop their own strategies to reduce them, while providing specific, local co-benefits.
These plans should include the carbon sequestration values associated with natural and
working lands, as well as the importance of jurisdictional lands with regards to water,
habitat, agricultural, and recreational resources. Examples of plan-level GHG reduction
actions that could be implemented by local governments are listed in Appendix B.
The Statewide Energy Efficiency Collaborative and ICLEI recently released a report,
The State of Local Climate Action: California 2016,193 which highlights local government
efforts, including the following:

193

130





In California, 60 percent of cities and over 70 percent of counties have completed
a GHG inventory, and 42 percent of local governments have completed a
climate, energy, or sustainability plan that directly addresses GHG emissions.
Many other community-scale local plans such as general plans, have emissions
reduction measures incorporated as well (see Governor’s Office of Planning and
Research [OPR] Survey questions 23 and 24).194
Over one hundred California local governments have developed emissions
reduction targets that, if achieved, would result in a reduction of more than
45 MMTCO2e each year by 2020, and 83 MMTCO2e each year by 2050.

Several other local government agencies have important impacts on GHG emissions.
Local air districts have a key role to play in reducing regional and local sources of
criteria pollutants and GHG emissions. As State agencies are doing, many air districts
are actively integrating climate protection into air quality programs. Air districts also
support local climate protection programs by providing technical assistance and data,
quantification tools, and even funding.195 Local metropolitan planning organizations
(MPOs) support the State’s climate action goals via sustainable communities strategies
(SCSs), required by the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008
(SB 375, Chapter 728, Statutes of 2008). Per SB 375, MPOs must prepare SCSs as
part of their regional transportation plan to meet regional GHG reduction targets for
passenger vehicles in 2020 and 2035. The SCSs contain land use, housing, and
transportation strategies that allow regions to meet their GHG emission reduction
targets.
State agencies support these local government actions in a number of ways.
CoolCalifornia.org is an informational website that includes a “local government toolkit”
to help local governments, small businesses, schools, and households reduce
emissions. The local government toolkit includes carbon calculators, success stories,
climate action plan templates, a Funding Wizard that outlines available grant and loan
programs, and monitoring and tracking tools developed through the Statewide Energy
Efficiency Collaborative in coordination with CARB and OPR. Additionally, OPR’s
forthcoming General Plan Guidelines will provide specific, updated guidance for
addressing GHG emissions in general plans and related documents. Finally, a
significant portion of the $3.4 billion in cap-and-trade expenditures to date has either
directly or indirectly supported local government efforts to reduce emissions, including
$142 million to support Transformative Climate Communities and provide technical
assistance for local planning efforts.

State agencies are interested in ideas to further support local government, small
business, school, and household efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Along these lines,
CARB is currently developing a centralized database and map that will allow local
governments to view and compare emission inventories, reduction targets, climate
action planning strategies, and other climate planning materials. This information will
help jurisdictions around California identify what climate action strategies are working in
other, similar jurisdictions across the State, and will facilitate collaboration among local
governments pursuing GHG reduction strategies and goals. This database and map
will be featured on the CoolCalifornia.org website and are anticipated to be available in
2017. Additional information on local government activities is available on Cal-Adapt
(www.cal-adapt.org), OPR (www.opr.ca.gov), and Cool California’s websites.
CoolCalifornia City Challenge
To engage communities in efforts to reduce GHG emissions, CARB has
partnered with Energy Upgrade California on the CoolCalifornia Challenge. It’s
a competition among California cities to reduce their carbon footprints and
build more vibrant and sustainable communities. Three challenges have been
completed. Most recently, the 2015–2016 Challenge included 22 cities and
engaged nearly 3,200 households, who each took actions to reduce energy use
and carbon GHG emissions. In total, the participants reported that they
completed actions that will collectively save 5,638 MTCO2, equivalent to the
emissions more than 1,000 cars or from electricity used by more than 2,500
California homes in a year.

B.

Climate Action through Local Planning and Permitting

Local governments play an important role in achieving the State’s long-term GHG goals
because they have broad influence, and sometimes-exclusive authority, over activities
that enable or thwart uptake of policies that can contribute to significant direct and
indirect GHG emissions. These actions include their community-scale planning and
permitting processes, discretionary actions, local codes and ordinances, outreach and
education efforts, and municipal operations. Local government efforts to reduce
emissions within their jurisdiction can also provide important co-benefits, including
improved air quality, local economic benefits, more sustainable communities, and an
improved quality of life.
Although the Proposed Plan focuses on State agency actions necessary to achieve the
2030 GHG limit, local governments are essential partners in achieving California’s goals
to reduce GHG emissions. The 2030 target will require an increase in the rate of
emission reductions compared to what was needed to achieve the 2020 limit, and this
will require action and collaboration at all levels, including local government action to
complement and support State-level actions. Cities and counties are already setting
targets, developing climate action plans, and making progress toward reducing
emissions.
132

Recommended Local Plan-Level Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Goals
CARB recommends that local governments aim to achieve community-wide goal to
achieve emissions of no more than six metric tons CO2e per capita by 2030 and no
more than two metric tons CO2e per capita by 2050.196 Per capita and mass emissions
goals are consistent with the statewide emissions limits established in AB 32, SB 32, Sb
391,197 and Executive Order S-3-05 and B-30-15.198 Service population goals allow for
linkages with metropolitan planning organization reductions required under SB 375. To
develop a GHG mitigation strategy to achieve these targets, local governments should
refer to “The U.S. Community Protocol for Accounting and Reporting of Greenhouse
Gas Emissions,” which provides detailed guidance on completing a GHG emissions
inventory at the community scale in the United States—including emissions from
businesses, residents, and transportation. Tools such as ClearPath California, which
was developed with California agencies, may also be used to support analysis of
community-scale GHG emissions.
These per-capita goals are also consistent with the Under 2 MOU that California
originated with Baden-Württemberg and has now been signed or endorsed by 165
jurisdictions representing 33 countries and six continents.199,200 Central to the Under 2
MOU is that all signatories agree to reduce their GHG emissions to two metric tons
CO2e per capita by 2050. This limit represents California’s and these other
governments’ recognition of their “fair share” to reduce GHG emissions to the
scientifically based levels necessary to limit global warming below two degrees Celsius.
This limit is also consistent with the Paris Agreement, which sets out a global action
plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global
warming to below 2°C.201 This local government-recommended goal expands upon the
reduction of 15 percent from “current” (2005–2008) levels by 2020 previously
recommended in the 2008 Scoping Plan.202 This is a statewide goal based on all
emissions sectors in the State, and local jurisdictions may choose to derive regionspecific evidenced based on per capita or per service population GHG emissions goals
tied to these statewide goals. Once adopted, the plan and policies to achieve this goal
can serve as a performance metric for subsequent projects.
The State must accommodate population growth and economic growth in a far more
sustainable manner than in the past. While State-level investments, policies, and
actions play an important role in shaping growth and development patterns, regional
and local governments and agencies are uniquely positioned to influence the future of
the built environment and its associated GHG emissions. Contributions from policies
and programs such as renewable energy and energy efficiency are helping achieve the
196

These goals are appropriate for the plan level (city, county, subregional, or regional level, as appropriate), but not for specific

near-term 2020 target, but longer-term targets cannot be achieved without land use
decisions that allows more efficient use and management of land and infrastructure.
Local governments have primary authority to plan, zone, approve, and permit how and
where land is developed to accommodate population growth, economic growth, and the
changing needs of their jurisdictions. Land use decisions affect GHG emissions
associated with transportation, water use, wastewater treatment, waste generation and
treatment, energy consumption, and conversion of natural and working lands. Local
land use decisions also play a particularly critical role in reducing GHG emissions
associated with the transportation sector, both at the project level, and in long-term
plans, including general plans, local and regional climate action plans, specific plans,
transportation plans, and supporting sustainable community strategies developed under
SB 375 among others. While the State can do more to accelerate and incentivize these
local decisions to better align with State and local climate and other goals, local actions
that reduce VMT are also necessary to meet transportation sector-specific goals and
achieve the 2030 target under SB 32.
Climate action plans (CAPs) allow a local government or region to look holistically at
regional GHG emissions and local strategies to support the statewide GHG limit.
Greenhouse gas strategies in CAPs can also lead to important co-benefits, such as
improved air quality, local economic benefits such as green jobs, more transportation
choices, improved public health and quality of life, protection of locally, statewide, and
globally important natural resources, and more equitable sharing of these benefits
across communities. These plans should include the carbon sequestration values
associated with natural and working lands, as well as the importance of jurisdictional
lands with regards to water, habitat, agricultural, and recreational resources. Examples
of plan-level GHG reduction actions that could be implemented by local governments
are listed in Appendix B.
Sufficiently detailed and adequately supported GHG reduction plans (including CAPs)
also provide local governments and project applicants with a valuable tool for
streamlining project-level environmental review. For example, under CEQA, individual
projects that comply with the strategies and actions within an adequate local CAP can
streamline the project-specific GHG analysis.203 The California Supreme Court in a
recent decision expressly called out this provision in CEQA that allows tiering from a
geographically specific GHG reduction plan.204 The court also recognized that GHG
determinations in CEQA should be consistent with the statewide Scoping Plan goals,
including the State’s long-term 2050 goals.205 The recommended local government
goals of six metric tons CO2e per capita by 2030 and no more than two metric tons
CO2e per capita by 2050 are intended to provide consistency with the 2030 Target
Scoping Plan and the State’s long term goals. Knowing that the per capita emissions
goals may not be appropriate in some jurisdictions, mass emissions and service
population emissions are also important to discuss. Per the community protocol, a local
government should focus on those emissions that the jurisdiction controls, while

disclosing emissions within its geographical boundary but for which the local
government does not have regulatory authority.
Project-Level Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Actions and Thresholds
For transportation projects or transportation components of projects that affect amounts
and patterns of vehicle travel, refer to OPR’s guidance on CEQA VMT thresholds of
significance and for examples of VMT mitigation.
Beyond plan-level thresholds and actions, local governments can also support climate
action when considering discretionary approvals and entitlements of individual projects
through CEQA.206 Absent conformity with an adequate geographically specific GHG
reduction plan, CARB recommends that all new land use development implement all
feasible measures to reduce GHG emissions.207
Several recent examples of sustainable land use development projects in California
have demonstrated that it is feasible to design projects that achieve zero net additional
GHG emissions. For example, several projects have received certification from the
governor under AB 900, the Jobs and Economic Improvement through Environmental
Leadership Act (Buchanan, Chapter 354, Statutes of 2011), demonstrating an ability to
design economically viable projects that create jobs without contributing any net
additional GHG emissions. 208 Another example is the Newhall Ranch Resource
Management and Development Plan and Spineflower Conservation Plan, in which the
applicant, Newhall Land and Farming Company, proposed a commitment to achieve
net-zero GHG emissions for a very large-scale residential and commercial specific
planned development in Santa Clarita Valley.209
CARB believes that achieving no net increase in GHG emissions is the correct overall
objective, but it may not be appropriate or feasible for every development project. An
inability to mitigate a project’s GHG emissions to zero does not necessarily imply a
substantial contribution to the cumulatively significant environmental impact of climate
change under CEQA. Lead agencies may develop evidenced-based bright-line numeric
thresholds—consistent with the Proposed Plan and the State’s long-term GHG goals—
and projects with emissions over that amount may be required to incorporate on-site
design features and mitigation measures that avoid or minimize project emissions to the
degree feasible.210 Otherwise, a performance-based metric using a climate action plan
or other plan to reduce GHG emissions is appropriate.
206

For transportation projects or transportation components of projects that affect amounts and patterns of vehicle travel, refer to
OPR’s guidance on CEQA VMT thresholds of significance and examples of VMT mitigation.
207
This is where there is no adequate climate action plan to tier from, as discussed earlier.

ARB provided some guidance on developing project thresholds in a paper issued in October 2008, which included a concept
utilizing a bright-line mass numeric threshold based on capturing approximately 90 percent of emissions in that sector and a concept
of minimum performance based standards. Some districts built upon that work to develop thresholds. For example, Santa Barbara
County adopted a bright-line numeric threshold of 1,000 MTCO2e/yr for industrial stationary-source projects, and Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District adopted a 10,000 MTCO2e/yr threshold for stationary source projects and a
1,100 MTCO2e threshold for construction activities and land development projects in their operational phase. ARB is not endorsing
any one of these approaches.

135

To the degree a project relies on GHG mitigation measures, CARB recommends that
lead agencies prioritize on-site design features and direct investments in GHG
reductions in the vicinity of the project, to help provide potential air quality and economic
co-benefits locally. For example, direct investment in a local building retrofit program
can pay for cool roofs, solar panels, solar water heaters, smart meters, energy efficient
lighting, energy efficient appliances, energy efficient windows, insulation, and water
conservation measures for homes within the geographic area of the project. This type
of local program generates real demand side benefits and local jobs, while creating the
market signals for energy efficiency materials and goods—some of which can be and
are currently produced in California. Other examples of local direct investments include
financing installation of regional electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, paying for
electrification of public school buses, and investing in local urban forests. It is critical
that any such investments in actions to reduce GHG emissions are real and
quantifiable. Where further project design or regional investments are infeasible or not
proven to be effective, it may be appropriate and feasible to mitigate project emissions
through purchasing and retiring carbon credits issued by a recognized and reputable
accredited carbon registry. Appendix B includes other examples of on-site project
design features, mitigation measures, and direct regional investments that may be
feasible to minimize GHG emissions from land use development projects.

Implementing the Proposed Plan

This Proposed Plan outlines the regulations, programs, and other mechanisms needed
to reduce GHG emissions in California. CARB and other State agencies will work
closely with local agencies, stakeholders, and the public to develop regulatory
measures and other programs to implement the Proposed Plan. CARB and other State
agencies will develop regulations in accordance with established rulemaking guidelines.
Per Executive Order B-30-15, as these regulatory measures and other programs are
developed, building programs for climate resiliency must also be a consideration.
Additionally, agencies will further collaborate and work to provide the institutional
support needed to overcome barriers that may currently hinder certain efforts to reduce
GHG emissions and to support the goals, actions, and measures identified for key
sectors in Chapter IV. Table V-1 provides a high-level summary of the Climate Change
Policies and Measures discussed in the Proposed Plan, including but not limited to,
those identified specifically to achieve the 2030 target.

A Comprehensive Approach to Support Climate Action

Ultimately, successfully tipping the scales in the fight against climate change relies on
our ability to make clean technologies clear winners in the marketplace and other
climate strategies clearly understood and easily accessible. We must support and
guide our businesses as they continue to innovate and make clean technologies ever
more attractive to ever more savvy consumers. Until the point that clean technologies
become the best and lowest cost option—which is clearly on the horizon for many
technologies, including renewable energy and electric cars—we must continue to
support emerging markets through incentives and outreach efforts. More than just
coordinating among agencies and providing institutional support as described above,
we will succeed if we tackle climate change from all angles—through regulatory and
policy development, targeted incentives, and education and outreach.
Regulations and Programmatic Development
Our decade of climate leadership has demonstrated that developing mitigation
strategies through a public process, where all stakeholders have a voice, leads to
effective actions that address climate change and yield a series of additional economic
138

and environmental co-benefits to the State. As we implement this Proposed Plan, State
agencies will continue to develop and implement new and existing programs, as
described herein. During any rulemaking process, there are many opportunities for both
informal interaction with technical staff in meetings and workshops, and formal
interaction at Board meetings, Commission business meetings, monthly public
meetings, and others. Each State agency will consider all information and stakeholder
input during the rulemaking process. Based on this information, the agency may modify
proposed measures to reflect the status of technological development, the cost of the
measure, the cost-effectiveness of the measures, and other factors before presenting
them for consideration and adoption.
Further, to achieve cost-effective GHG reductions, California State agencies must
consider the environmental impact of small businesses and provide mechanisms to
assist businesses as GHG reduction measures are implemented. CARB provides
resources and tips for small businesses to prevent pollution, minimize waste, and save
energy and water on an informational website: www.CoolCalifornia.org. California’s
small businesses and their employees represent a valuable economic resource in the
State and “greening” existing businesses is not only achievable, but sets an example for
new businesses which will prove significant as California transitions to a low carbon
state.
State agencies conduct environmental and environmental justice assessments of our
regulatory actions. Many of the requirements in AB 32 overlap with agency traditional
evaluations. In adopting regulations to implement the measures recommended in the
Proposed Plan, or including in the regulations the use of market-based compliance
mechanisms to comply with the regulations, the agency will ensure that the measures
have undergone the aforementioned screenings and meet the requirements established
in California Health and Safety Code Section 38562(b)(1-9) and Section 38570(b)(1-3).
Incentive Programs
Financial incentives and direct funding are critical components of the State’s climate
framework. In particular, incentives and funding are necessary to support GHG
emission reduction strategies for priority sectors, sources, and technologies. Although
California has a number of existing incentive programs, available funding is limited. It is
critical to target public investments efficiently and in ways that encourage integrated,
systemwide solutions to produce deep and lasting public benefits. Significant
investments of private capital, supported by targeted, priority investments of public
funding, are necessary to scale deployment and to maximize benefits. Public
investments can help incentivize early action to accelerate market transition to cleaner
technologies, which can also be supported by regulatory measures.
Many existing State funding programs work in tandem to reduce emissions from GHGs,
criteria pollutants, and toxic air contaminants, and are helping to foster the transition to
a clean energy economy and are protecting and managing land for carbon
sequestration. State law, including Senate Bill 535 (De León, Chapter 830, Statutes of

139

2012) and Assembly Bill 1550 (Gomez, Chapter 369, Statutes of 2016) also requires
focused investment in low income and disadvantaged communities.
The State will need to continue to coordinate and utilize funding sources, such as the
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (cap-and-trade auction proceeds), the Alternative and
Renewable Fuel and Vehicle Technology Program (AB 118), Electric Program
Investment Charge (EPIC) Program, Carl Moyer Program, Air Quality Improvement
Program, and Proposition 39 to expand clean energy investments in California and
further reduce GHG and criteria emissions. Additionally, programs including the
Bioenergy Feed-In Tariff, created by Senate Bill 1122 (Rubio, Chapter 612, Statutes of
2012), Low Carbon Fuel Standard, Cap-and-Trade, Self-Generation Incentive Program,
Federal Renewable Fuel Standard, utility incentives pursuant to Assembly Bill 1900
(Gatto, Chapter 602, Statutes of 2012), and others provide important market signals and
potential revenue streams to support projects to reduce GHG emissions.
These programs represent just a portion of the opportunities that exist at the federal,
State, and local levels to incentivize GHG emission reductions. The availability of
dedicated and long-lasting funding sources is critical to help meet the State’s climate
objectives and help provide certainty and additional partnership opportunities at the
national, State, regional, and local levels for further investing in projects that have the
potential to expand investments in California’s clean economy and further reductions in
GHG emissions.
Public Education and Outreach Efforts
California State agencies are committed to meaningful opportunities for public input and
effective engagement with stakeholders and the public through the development of the
Scoping Plan, and as measures are implemented through workshops and other
meetings. Additionally, the State has broad public education and outreach campaigns
to support markets for key technologies, like ZEVs and energy efficiency, as well as
resources to support local and voluntary actions, such as CoolCalifornia.org.
In developing this Proposed Plan, there has been extensive outreach with
environmental justice organizations and disadvantaged communities. The EJAC
launched a community engagement process starting in July 2016, conducting 11
community meetings throughout the State and collecting hundreds of individual
comments. To enhance the engagement opportunity, CARB coordinated with local
government agencies and sister State agencies to hold collaborative discussions with
local residents about specific climate issues that impact their lives. This effort was well
received and attended by local community residents and initiated a new community
engagement endeavor for CARB. Recognizing the value of the input received and the
opportunity to present California’s climate strategy to communities across the State,
CARB intends to continue this community involvement to generate awareness about
California’s climate strategy and be responsive to specific community needs as climate
programs are implemented.

140

Education and Environment Initiative
The California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), the California
Department of Education, and the California Natural Resources Agency have
developed an environmental curriculum that is being taught in more than half of
California’s school districts. The Education and Environment Initiative (EEI)
provides California’s teachers with tools to educate students about the natural
environment and how everyday choices can improve our planet and save money.
