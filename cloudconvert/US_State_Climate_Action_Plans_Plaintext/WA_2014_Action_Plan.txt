Executive Summary
Governor Jay Inslee's Executive Order 14-04 (issued in April 2014) established the Carbon Emissions
Reduction Taskforce (CERT or Taskforce) and charged it to "provide recommendations on the design and
implementation of a carbon emissions limits and market mechanisms program for Washington." In the
preamble to his Executive Order, the Governor noted that a recent independent review of existing State and
Federal policies prepared for the Climate Executive and Legislative Workgroup (CLEW) concluded that
"Washington will not meet our statutory limits without additional action." Additionally, the Governor stated
that "it is critical to Washington's economic future that greenhouse gas reduction strategies be designed and
implemented in a manner that minimizes cost impacts to Washington citizens and businesses" and that our
State "needs to take additional actions now, to meet our statutory commitment, to do our part in preventing
further climate change, to capture the job growth opportunities of a clean energy economy, and to meet our
obligation to our children and future generations." The Executive Order thus framed and guided the CERT
member discussions and the perspectives and findings contained in this report. CERT members intend that
this report will serve as a valuable resource to inform effective public policy.
The Executive Order further framed the CERT’s charge by stating that a carbon emissions reduction program
in Washington must:




“establish a cap on carbon pollution emissions, with binding requirements to meet our statutory
emission limits”;
“include the market mechanisms needed to meet the limits in the most effective and efficient
manner possible”;
“be designed to maximize the benefits and minimize the implementation costs, considering our
emissions and energy sources, and our businesses and jobs”.

In developing recommendations for the Governor, the Executive Order asks Taskforce members to
participate in the “best interests of the current and future citizens of the State”. The Taskforce included 21
individuals drawn from business, labor, public interests, public health, and federal, tribal, and local
government entities. Each member served on the CERT as an individual and his or her support for this report
should be understood in that context. The Taskforce (See Appendix 1) met in person six times between April
29 and October 28, 2014. Meetings provided for presentations on and discussions of the workings of both
emissions-based (cap-and-trade system) and price-based (carbon tax) market mechanisms; current examples
of market mechanism design and implementation in the United Kingdom, British Columbia, California, and
Quebec; a review of how each market mechanism’s approach could be designed to achieve the objectives of
the Executive Order; initial thinking about market mechanism design for Washington State; an overview of
health-related effects of climate change; and very preliminary economic analysis of the impact of placing a
price on carbon in Washington.
The CERT structured its discussions around eight topics that comprised an Evaluation Framework reflecting
the Executive Order’s requirements and the CERT’s assessment of the critical interests and factors that would
reflect what is most important for Washington to understand when considering either market mechanism.
The topics (See Table 1 in the main report text) included: confidence in meeting emissions reduction limits;
sufficiency of a carbon price to drive investment shifts; minimizing cost and competitiveness impacts;
maximizing economic development and job growth; minimizing cost impacts to consumers and low-income
communities; reducing public health risks; effective administration; and influencing national and
international action. Section 3 of this report provides background context and the CERT perspectives on each

1

Evaluation Framework topic. The text strives to provide a balanced presentation of both emissions-based
and price-based approaches, with the full range of CERT perspectives synthesized to guide and provide a
foundation for further, thoughtful consideration of the design and implementation of a market mechanism
program for the State of Washington.
CERT deliberations, in addition to providing for a range of perspectives on the design aspects of emissionsbased and price-based market mechanism approaches, supported the development of four Findings
(presented in full in Section 4). These findings reflect CERT members’ common perspective on the key
aspects of, and potential role in State policy for, a market mechanism program. The highlights for these
findings appear below.
CERT Finding 1: Emissions-based or price-based market mechanisms add unique features to an overall
carbon emissions reduction policy framework. Both mechanisms internalize a price on carbon, can provide
coverage across a full or nearly full range of emissions sources, and do not dictate specific, and can provide
for a range of, strategies to meet compliance obligations and reduce emissions. Both mechanisms thus share
important similarities, and CERT deliberations indicate that both come with advantages, while their
disadvantages can be mitigated such that the differences between the two can be minimized.
CERT Finding 2: Thoughtful and informed policy design, drawing on the lessons learned from other
jurisdictions, CERT member perspectives, and additional analysis (see Finding 4), will be required to
achieve either an emissions-based or price-based policy approach that is workable for the State of
Washington. CERT perspectives indicate that either an emissions-based or price-based policy adopted by
the State can help the state build a coherent carbon emissions reduction strategy that aligns private
incentives in support of reaching the State’s emissions limits. Development of such policy does, however,
have substantial design challenges, and although these mechanisms can serve uniquely important functions,
their design and implementation requires thoughtful harmonization with Washington’s existing and potential
future policy framework. To meet the objectives reflected in the Evaluation Framework topics, specific
design elements available under these mechanisms will need to address: generating confidence in the
strength and integrity of the State’s emission reduction commitment; establishing carbon prices that limit
volatility and provide long-term certainty; addressing competitiveness impacts; considering a range of
revenue recycling options to address equity and affordability concerns especially for low and moderate
income communities and communities of color, competitiveness and cost impacts to businesses, support
growth strategies, facilitate a sound transition to a lower carbon economy (thereby enabling the lifestyle
changes that sustained carbon emissions reduction requires), reducing public health impacts and supporting
adaptation particularly for vulnerable communities and heavily impacted economic sectors; and examining
coordination/linkage with other jurisdictions that have policies placing a price on carbon.
CERT Finding 3: Reaching the State’s statutory carbon emissions limits will require a harmonized,
comprehensive policy approach. The thoughtful and informed design of an emissions-based or price-based
market mechanism, along with a well harmonized set of complementary policies, can help align incentives
and provide a foundational, long-term signal in support of economically efficient shifts in energy uses and
investment patterns. A market mechanism can have a special role as the “economic infrastructure” for an
overall policy design by establishing a common price signal across all emission sources and emissions
reduction opportunities. Any overall suite of policies will be highly interactive and needs to be built and
harmonized in a cohesive and comprehensive manner to align both the short-term and long-term incentives
as efficiently as possible. Particular attention needs to be given to the transportation sector as the largest
source of carbon emissions in the State. With an explicit cost placed on carbon, the price of transportation
fuel will increase. At the same time, complementary policies, along with the targeted use of revenues, will be

2

designed to create downward pressure on overall transportation costs by incentivizing innovation and
investment which diversify fuel sources, expand the use of low and zero emissions vehicles, and expand
accessible public transit. Overall, a policy design going forward needs to address an integrated approach
which considers such items as: land-use policies; equitable transit oriented development; alternatives to
current single occupancy vehicles such as adequate transit, zero emissions vehicles, and alternative fuel
infrastructure; the different needs of rural communities and industries that require long distance travel; the
effects on and needs of low-income communities; and the incentives for the electric sector to take on
activities like vehicle electrification infrastructure that reduce societal emissions while potentially increasing
emissions in the electric sector.
CERT Finding 4: Certain important questions remain unanswered and further analysis will be important to
provide the foundation for a well informed and well-functioning policy approach. The CERT members
understand that the State is doing further analysis as it proceeds toward a thoughtful policy design, and CERT
members encourage this further work. CERT members further believe that continued analytical work as any
policy is implemented will help define and characterize the impact of the policies on the objectives captured
in the Evaluation Framework. CERT members have compiled a useful, though not prescriptive or
comprehensive, list of the information and analysis that could be helpful in shaping policy. The information
and analysis items fall into four categories (specific areas of further information and analysis are provided for
each in Appendix 4 of this report): completing and validating macroeconomic analysis; refining the
understanding of comparative advantage/disadvantage dynamics for Washington State business; identifying
and analyzing the impacts (including job loss particularly for vulnerable fossil fuel dependent industries) to
low/moderate income and vulnerable communities of both climate change and carbon pricing; and refining
the anticipated revenue picture.
The members of the CERT appreciate the opportunity to serve the State in this capacity as the question of
how best to reduce carbon emissions in Washington is considered by policy makers and our elected leaders.
The CERT members represented a broad range of interests and expertise, and individual members have
varying opinions about the basic policy choices and specific design elements best suited to Washington
State’s carbon emissions context. With this in mind, Appendix 6 provides individually attributed comments
submitted by CERT members to make clear their specific interests and recommendations to the Governor’s
Office for proceeding forward with a carbon emissions reduction market mechanism for the State of
Washington.

1. Introduction
Governor Jay Inslee's Executive Order 14-04 (issued in April 2014) established the Carbon Emissions
Reduction Taskforce (CERT or Taskforce) and charged it to "provide recommendations on the design and
implementation of a carbon emissions limits and market mechanisms program for Washington." In the
preamble to his Executive Order, Governor Inslee states: “…the University of Washington, as required by
statute, recently released its summary of existing knowledge regarding causes, impacts, and effects of
climate change on Washington State, concluding:







Human activities have increased atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases to levels unprecedented in
at least the past 800,000 years;
Washington has experienced long-term warming, a lengthening of the frost-free season, and more
frequent nighttime heat waves. Sea level is rising along most of Washington’s coast, coastal ocean
acidity has increased, glacial area and spring snowpack have declined, and peak streamflows in many
rivers have shifted earlier in the year;
Three key areas of risk, specifically changes in the natural timing of water availability, sea level rise
and ocean acidity, and increased forest mortality, will likely bring significant consequences for the
economy, infrastructure, natural systems, and human health of the region; and
Decisions made today about greenhouse gas emissions will have a significant effect on the amount of
warming that will occur after mid-century.”

The Governor further noted that a recent independent review of existing State and Federal policies prepared
for the Climate Executive and Legislative Workgroup (CLEW) concluded that "Washington will not meet our
statutory limits without additional action." Additionally, the Governor stated that "it is critical to
Washington's economic future that greenhouse gas reduction strategies be designed and implemented in a
manner that minimizes cost impacts to Washington citizens and businesses" and that our State "needs to
take additional actions now, to meet our statutory commitment, to do our part in preventing further climate
change, to capture the job growth opportunities of a clean energy economy, and to meet our obligation to
our children and future generations." The Executive Order thus framed and guided the CERT member
discussions and the perspectives and findings contained in this report. CERT members intend that this report
will serve as a valuable resource to inform effective public policy.

A. Background - Climate Policy Context in Washington State
The 2008 Washington State Legislature enacted E2SHB 2815 codified in the Public Health and Safety Chapter
70.235 which specifies limits to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Washington. RCW 70.235.020 details the
following statutory GHG limits for Washington State:
“(1)(a) The state shall limit emissions of greenhouse gases to achieve the following emission
reductions for Washington state:
i.
ii.
iii.

By 2020, reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases in the state to 1990 levels;
By 2035, reduce overall emissions of greenhouse gases in the state to twenty-five
percent below 1990 levels;
By 2050, the state will do its part to reach global climate stabilization levels by
reducing overall emissions to fifty percent below 1990 levels, or seventy percent
below the state's expected emissions that year.”

4

RCW 70.235.005 provides further framing of the policy context in which the CERT has undertaken its charge.
1. “The legislature finds that Washington has long been a national and international leader on energy
conservation and environmental stewardship, including air quality protection, renewable energy
development and generation, emission standards for fossil-fuel based energy generation, energy
efficiency programs, natural resource conservation, vehicle emission standards, and the use of
biofuels. Washington is also unique among most states in that in addition to its commitment to
reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, it has established goals to grow the clean energy sector and
reduce the state's expenditures on imported fuels.”
2. “The legislature further finds that Washington should continue its leadership on climate change
policy by creating accountability for achieving the emission reductions established in RCW
70.235.020, participating in the design of a regional multi-sector, market-based system to help
achieve those emission reductions, assessing other market strategies to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases, and ensuring the state has a well trained workforce for our clean energy future.”
3. “It is the intent of the legislature that the state will: (a) Limit and reduce emissions of greenhouse gas
consistent with the emission reductions established in RCW 70.235.020; (b) minimize the potential to
export pollution, jobs, and economic opportunities; and (c) reduce emissions at the lowest cost to
Washington's economy, consumers, and businesses.”
4. “In the event the state elects to participate in a regional multi-sector market-based system, it is the
intent of the legislature that the system will become effective by January 1, 2012, after authority is
provided to the department for its implementation. By acting now, Washington businesses and
citizens will have adequate time and opportunities to be well positioned to take advantage of the
low-carbon economy and to make necessary investments in low-carbon technology.”
5. “It is also the intent of the legislature that the regional multi-sector market-based system recognize
Washington's unique emissions portfolio, including the state's hydroelectric system, the
opportunities presented by Washington's abundant forest resources and agriculture land, and the
state's leadership in energy efficiency and the actions it has already taken that have reduced its
generation of greenhouse gas emissions and that entities receive appropriate credit for early actions
to reduce greenhouse gases.”
6. “If any revenues that accrue to the state are created by a market system, they must be used to
further the state's efforts to achieve the goals established in RCW 70.235.020, address the impacts of
global warming on affected habitats, species, and communities, and increase investment in the clean
energy economy particularly for communities and workers that have suffered from heavy job losses
and chronic unemployment and underemployment.”
Additionally, as outlined in RCW 70.235.040, The Washington Department of Ecology will make
recommendations to the Legislature regarding whether the greenhouse gas emissions reductions required
under RCW 70.235.020 need to be updated based on the science on human-caused climate change reported
in global or national assessments of climate change science. As directed in the Executive Order 14-04, the
Department of Ecology has reviewed the limits, and the report is expected to be available in late 2014.
In 2010 and 2011, Washington GHG emissions totaled 96.1 and 91.7 million metric tons carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMTCO2e)1 respectively (See Figure 2 in Appendix 2 for a graph of historical emissions back to
1990, as well as business-as-usual projected emissions through 2050). The transportation sector accounts for
46 percent of this total, and electricity consumption and industrial sources each comprise 17 percent.
1

The following six GHGs are included in Washington’s inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these gases are converted to the common unit
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), based on their relative global warming potential, in accordance with methods used by US EPA.

5

Additional sector sources include residential (6 percent), agriculture (6 percent), waste (4 percent), and
commercial (4 percent)2. (See Appendix 2: Washington State GHG Emissions, 2011 for further details.)
Washington has implemented several policies to reduce emissions in the transportation, electricity, and
residential and commercial sectors. These policies include, but are not limited to, the Renewable Fuel
Standard, Washington State Energy Code, closing the State’s only coal-fired electric generating plant
(Centralia), GHG Emissions Performance Standards, Appliance Standards, Energy Independence Act (I-937),
Energy Efficiency and Energy Consumption Programs for Public Buildings, Conversion of Public Fleet to Clean
Fuels, Purchasing of Clean Cars, and Growth Management Act. Several federal policies also may contribute to
meeting the State’s limits on GHGs. These federal policies include, but are not limited to: renewable fuels
standards; tax incentives for renewable energy; tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles; Corporate Average
Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for cars and light trucks; and Clean Air Act requirements for emissions from
stationary sources and fossil-fueled electric generating units, including the proposed Clean Power Plan rule.
In 2013, the Washington Legislature passed E2SSB 5802, an act relating to developing recommendations to
achieve the State’s GHG targets. The Climate Legislative and Executive Workgroup, composed of the
Governor and four members of the Washington Legislature, was created and charged with developing
recommendations. This effort included an independent review of the estimated emission reductions
contribution of the existing State and Federal policies. The Workgroup examined several potential policies
that the State could implement, including: Low Carbon Fuel Standard; Zero Emissions Vehicle Mandate; five
percent Renewable Fuel Standard; Public Benefit Fund; Property Assessment Clean Energy; Appliance
Standards; and Feed-in-Tariff, 375 MW Cap. This assessment concluded that Washington is unlikely to meet
its statutory emission reductions for 2020, 2035, or 2050 with the current State and Federal policies, nor is
Washington likely to meet its limits with the potential State policies (See Appendix 2).
On April 29, 2014, Washington State Governor Inslee issued Executive Order 14-04 on Washington Carbon
Pollution Reduction and Clean Energy Action. The Executive Order outlines a series of steps to meet the
statutory limits on carbon emissions enacted by the 2008 Washington State Legislature. The Executive Order
established the CERT and directs State agencies to lead efforts to reduce emissions related to coal-fired
electricity, clean transportation, clean technology, energy efficiency, State government operations, a review
of the carbon pollution limits, intergovernmental relations and public outreach, and State agency
coordination.
The Taskforce was established to “provide recommendations on the design and implementation of a carbon
emission limits and market mechanisms program for Washington.” The Executive Order states that a carbon
emissions reduction program in Washington must:




“establish a cap on carbon pollution emissions, with binding requirements to meet our statutory
emission limits”;
“include the market mechanisms needed to meet the limits in the most effective and efficient
manner possible”;
“be designed to maximize the benefits and minimize the implementation costs, considering our
emissions and energy sources, and our businesses and jobs.”

In developing recommendations for the Governor, the Executive Order asks Taskforce members to
participate in the “best interests of the current and future citizens of the State” and states that the Taskforce
must consider measures to:









“help offset any cost impacts to consumers and workers”;
“protect low-income households”;
“assist energy-intensive trade-exposed businesses in their transition away from carbon-based fuels”;
“provide oversight and regulation of the markets”;
“be fair in allocating responsibility to emission sources”;
“minimize shifting of emissions and jobs to out-of-state locations (“leakage”);
“provide clear accountability for, along with appropriate flexibility in, compliance”; and
“provide for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of the program, as needed to secure
benefits and minimize unintended consequences.”

B. Background on Emissions-based and Price-based Market Mechanisms
A market mechanism program aims to align private economic incentives with a public policy commitment to
reduce GHG emissions. Under a market mechanism, entities have flexibility to either pay the internalized
carbon price or reduce their emissions to reduce their exposure to carbon prices. In contrast, direct
regulation would generally require specific emissions standards or installation of particular technologies.
Market mechanisms aim to provide greater compliance flexibility at a lower overall cost.
The CERT was asked to focus its discussions on two market mechanism options: emissions-based (also known
as cap-and-trade) and price-based (also known as carbon tax) approaches. An emissions-based system
typically sets a limit or “cap” on the total quantity of carbon3 that can be emitted in a specified timeframe.
The system issues a fixed number of emissions allowances, tradable certificates that permit a covered entity
to emit a specified amount of carbon (one ton CO2e per allowance), which are then auctioned or freely
distributed. The quantity of allowances is fixed, and the price of allowances may vary depending on demand.
After the end of a compliance period, covered sources must submit a number of allowances equal to their
emissions. A price-based system typically sets a price on each unit of carbon emitted. Covered entities must
pay an amount equal to the carbon price times their carbon emissions. In contrast to an emissions-based
system, a price-based system typically fixes the carbon price in advance, while the amount of carbon
emissions may vary. Either approach can work in concert with other tax changes to be, in effect, “revenue
neutral” to society, as a whole.

C. Roadmap of this Report
This report is designed to:
1. Review background information shared with the CERT to support their evaluation of the two market
mechanism policy design options.
2. Collect and synthesize the perspectives shared verbally and in writing by CERT members into a set of
observations for Governor Inslee’s consideration relative to the design and implementation of a
carbon emission limit and market mechanism program in Washington.

A. Taskforce Background
The Taskforce included 21 individuals drawn from business, labor, public interests, public health, and federal,
tribal, and local government entities. The Taskforce (See Appendix 1) met in person six times between April
29 and October 28, 2014. Over the course of the CERT meetings, presentations included the following:





Introduction to carbon markets by technical policy experts.
Overview of emissions trading and market mechanisms approaches in the United Kingdom by
representatives of the United Kingdom.
Summary of emission trading systems and detailed information on the tools and strategies available
to Washington to achieve emission reductions in the transportation, buildings, and electricity sectors
by the Washington Governor’s Office and Department of Ecology.
Presentation on the policy choices California made and why in the design of their emissions-based
approach by a representative from the California Air Resources Board.
Presentation on the policy choices British Columbia made and why in the design of their price-based
approach by a representative from the Province of British Columbia, Ministry of the Environment,
Climate Action Secretariat.

Background information, from technical policy experts, on how a number of the key, widelyrecognized attributes of emissions-based and price-based approaches align or differ with respect to
the Evaluation Framework topics and on how an emissions-based and a price-based system could be
designed to address each of the Evaluation Framework topic areas.
Background information, from technical policy experts, on the program features and options for a
Washington State linked emissions-based system and a price-based system. The assessment
indicated which of the policy design features of a Washington emissions-based system linked to the
California-Quebec market would need to be identical or harmonized to the California-Quebec system
or would allow significant flexibility for Washington to tailor the design and operation.
Background information, from technical policy experts, on why and how the transportation sector
could be incorporated into a market mechanism in Washington.
A very preliminary economic analysis of the impact of placing a price on carbon in Washington.
An overview of health-related effects of climate change by the Dean of the University of Washington
School of Public Health.

During the first two CERT meetings, CERT members received presentations and background information
designed to provide for consideration of both an emissions-based and price-based policy approach. Through
presentations provided at the third and fourth CERT meetings, the Washington State Governor’s Office
indicated a “starting point” inclination towards an emissions-based approach as the market mechanism
potentially best suited to meet the objectives set forth in the Executive Order. CERT meeting agendas,
presentations, and discussions provided for and invited a balanced consideration by CERT members of both
emissions-based and price-based policy approaches within the context of the Evaluation Framework (See
Appendix 5 for link to WA CERT Evaluation Framework, Review of Topics: Version 2 in Meeting 4 Materials).4
In addition, the transportation sector received substantial attention during CERT discussions given its
prominence in the State’s carbon emissions profile. CERT members were also invited to provide written input
throughout the process.
CERT members represented and provided individual perspectives unless specifically stated otherwise as an
organizational or other perspective, and the perspectives provided here reflect individual perspectives
captured on a non-attributed basis. Fully attributed individual comments submitted by CERT members are
provided in Appendix 6. CERT members believe it is important to note that the Taskforce was asked to assess
a complex issue and formulate their perspectives over a short period of time. Important questions could
benefit from further evaluation in order to gain a more complete understanding of the specific impacts of
different policy approaches (see Section 4, Finding 4 below). As dialogue proceeds forward beyond the CERT
and further analysis is undertaken, the results will ultimately influence CERT member perspectives on, and
participation in, the discussions about these policy instruments.

B. Preliminary Economic Modeling Scenarios
At the September 9 and October 28 CERT meetings, the State’s OFM modeling team presented preliminary
economic analysis of two carbon emission pricing scenarios. These presentations intended to illustrate the
models’ capabilities and to spur CERT dialogue on how the State should design further analyses to inform
policy design. They were not calibrated to reflect any existing policy preferences of either the CERT or the
Governor’s Office. The State is performing these and future analyses to inform policy design and the public
on the potential economic implications of different design strategies.
The State used two models (Carbon Tax Analysis Model (CTAM) and REMI) in sequential fashion to
characterize the effects of a carbon price on emissions levels and the broader economy through 2035 when
the State must meet its second carbon emissions reduction limit. The preliminary analysis looked at two
scenarios modeled starting in 2015: a low carbon price scenario beginning at $12 a ton (approximately the
current price in the California market) and increased $.60 annually through 2020, and by $2/ton annually
thereafter until 2035; and a higher carbon price scenario ($12 a ton in 2015, increasing by $8/ton annually
thereafter). The higher price scenario reflects the CTAM model’s estimate of the price levels required to meet
the State’s statutory emission limits for 2020 and 2035, assuming price was the sole driver of emissions
reductions and no price volatility as a function of market manipulation or other factors.
Additionally, one approach to reinvesting program revenues back into the economy was modeled5 to
examine the potential economic impacts of the State’s use of program proceeds (See Appendix 3 for more
information on the revenue reinvestment formula). The modeled approach was also intended to be
illustrative, does not reflect a particular desired policy outcome, and is one of numerous scenarios that will
be run by OFM in the future.
Under both preliminary modeling scenarios (and their associated assumptions), fossil fuel prices rise
accordingly; statewide economic impact on jobs, GDP, and personal income are likely to be close to zero (in
the noise) or slightly positive. Results vary more at the industry level with some industries negatively affected
and some positively affected. Again, the changes are small under both pricing scenarios. During the
presentation to the CERT on October 28th, OFM emphasized that how revenue from either allowance sales or
tax receipts is allocated will be an important determinant of how impacts are distributed across economic
sectors and income groups.
Additionally, CERT members recognized how the assumptions underlying the model (See Appendix 3) are
critical to interpreting results. In particular, certain CERT members pointed out that the scenarios anticipated
no exceptional innovation or structural shifts in the economy that significantly shift energy demand and
supply patterns. For future iterations, the State is working to better understand the role of innovation in
shaping demand, increasing the availability of new fuel options, and lowering overall energy costs.
These and other observations from the CERT will help guide further iterations of the economic analysis, and
these will be made publicly available as they are completed.6 These presentations helped frame and influence
the CERT member perspectives provided under each of the Evaluation Framework topics presented in
Section 3.

These scenarios used one revenue reinvestment formula to model potential impacts: 30% to Working Families Tax Credit; 15% B&O tax cut to
trade exposed industries; 40% B&O tax cut to construction sector; 10% Public Utilities Tax cut to electric power generation, transmission, and
distribution; and 5% to state General Fund. As mentioned above, the modeled approach was also intended to be illustrative, does not reflect a
particular desired policy outcome, and is one of numerous scenarios that will be run by OFM in the future.

3. Taskforce Evaluation Framework for Consideration of the
Design and Implementation of a Market Mechanism in
Washington
The Governor’s Executive Order outlined several requirements for the market mechanisms program and
criteria for use in the Taskforce’s deliberations. CERT members shared their interests and priorities for the
design and implementation of any potential market mechanism during the first two CERT meetings. From
those discussions the Evaluation Framework emerged bringing together the criteria outlined in the Executive
Order and the interests and priorities shared by CERT members. The eight topics in the Evaluation Framework
(Table 1) reflect topics of substantial relevance to any market mechanism system (including for Washington)
and served as the basis for CERT member review and consideration of policy design and implementation
options for a carbon emission limits and market mechanisms program in Washington.

Background Information reflects presentations provided to CERT members during meetings, with
this information informing CERT member perspectives and findings for the design and
implementation of a carbon emissions limit and market mechanisms program in Washington. This
section draws heavily on the presentations and background materials that were prepared for the
deliberations including WA CERT Evaluation Framework, Review of Topics: Version 2 (See Appendix 5
for link to Meeting 4 Materials).
CERT Perspectives capture CERT member observations shared verbally during CERT meetings and in
written feedback following each meeting. These perspectives are designed to provide guidance to
the Governor if a particular carbon emissions limit and market mechanism program is designed and

11

implemented. This synthesis seeks to provide the full range of perspectives shared by CERT members
and is designed to provide a foundation for further, thoughtful consideration of a carbon emissions
limit and market mechanism approach in Washington. CERT members agree that a thoughtful policy
going forward needs to take these perspectives, and others in the broader community, into account.

1. Reach WA’s emissions reduction limits with high confidence and consideration of WA’s emissions
and energy sources
Background:
Reaching the State’s emission limits with high confidence depends on several key design factors, including
the setting or targeting of a specific cap on emissions, coverage of key emissions sources, and accounting for
expected emissions from those sectors not covered by the market-based program. An emissions-based
approach establishes a statutory declining cap on aggregate emissions across covered sectors. The cap on
emissions provides a long-term market signal to all emitters of the requirement to reduce emissions
consistent with the emissions cap schedule. A price-based approach does not set an explicit cap on emissions,
but the carbon price (i.e., tax rate) could conceivably be adjusted (increased or lowered) should the pace of
carbon emissions reductions vary from the target trajectory. Each approach has the ability to cover the same
emissions sources and greenhouse gases. The greater the coverage of emission sources, the greater the
confidence will be in achieving the State’s emissions limit. In the State of Washington, inclusion of
transportation fuels, the largest contribution to the State’s emissions, is central to achieving broad coverage
and can be achieved under either approach, although a price-based system, in principle, should be easier to
administer for a larger number of emission sources. Either system can align incentives and serve as a
backstop to spur additional emission reductions in case other emission-reducing (“complementary”) policies
deliver fewer benefits than expected. Confidence in meeting the State’s limits also depends on careful
consideration of future emissions from sectors not covered by a carbon pricing policy.7
CERT Perspectives:
CERT members shared a range of perspectives regarding the contribution of emissions-based and price-based
approaches to help achieve the State’s emissions reductions limits with high confidence. Central to the
discussions is CERT member recognition that confidence in the strength and integrity of the emission
reduction commitment made through State policy, along with a clear and meaningful price signal, can act as
a foundation for achieving Washington’s statutory carbon emissions limits. Certain CERT members also
emphasized that Washington must comply with its statutory limits.
Certain CERT member observations signaled that an emissions-based approach is generally considered to
provide greater confidence that a specific emissions reductions limit will be achieved. In particular, certain
CERT members observed that:
1. By establishing a statutory and declining cap on emissions, an emissions-based approach makes the
State’s carbon emissions over time predictable and enforceable; and
2. An emissions-based approach draws on the power of the market to establish a price for carbon
emissions in support of meeting the State’s emission limits.

7

For example, sectors such as waste or agriculture are generally not covered by carbon pricing policies. However, all sectors are included in the
State’s overall emissions limit. Therefore, when setting the cap under an emission-based approach or a carbon tax under a price-based
approach, expected increases or decreases in emissions from covered sectors need to be taken into account to ensure the State meets its
overall emissions limit.

12

At the same time, certain CERT member observations highlighted that there are ways to design a price-based
approach to support confidence in achieving the State’s carbon emissions limits, while other CERT members
emphasized that, comparatively, an emissions-based approach can be anticipated to provide greater inherent
emissions reduction confidence. In particular, certain CERT perspectives highlighted the policy design
options, such as adjustment to the tax rate in response to emissions levels, that can provide greater
confidence in achieving the State’s emissions limits. Certain CERT members also indicated that a price-based
system is generally considered to provide greater confidence in the predictability of the economic impacts on
the State’s economy and can be more easily constructed to be revenue neutral if this emerges as an element
of a program. A further CERT perspective indicated that a transparent (e.g., public disclosure) reporting and
independent verification element for emissions reduction will be important to influence behavior. For
example, the ability of the public to know the energy efficiency status of a building could be a key ingredient
in driving material emissions reductions in this important emissions sector. This led certain CERT members to
conclude that adequate transparency will depend heavily on thorough monitoring.
CERT members also discussed the importance of the scope (or coverage) of a market mechanism in relation
to the level of confidence that the State will achieve its emissions limits. Considering that the transportation
sector represents a substantial portion of the State’s carbon emissions (46 percent in 2011), CERT members
specified the importance of including the transportation sector in any market-based approach that emerges
in the State. Certain CERT members observed that phasing in the coverage of different sectors could be a
means to provide for a more stable transition from business-as-usual to improved carbon emissions
performance. An additional CERT member perspective indicated that investing in low-carbon alternatives to
covered emitters, including transportation fuels, will be critical to the system’s success.

2. Establish a carbon price signal sufficient to stimulate a shift in investment patterns
Background:
Emissions-based and price-based market mechanisms seek to establish a common price signal across all
covered emissions sources and emissions reduction opportunities. Conceptually, the price signal can serve to
level the playing field among sectors and prompt emissions reducing behavior in the near-term. Under either
an emissions-based or price-based approach, the strength of the price signal to stimulate investment
depends on the carbon price level, price certainty, and long-term stability established by the policy. Under a
price-based approach, the price level is fixed in advance, and this can be useful for informing long-term
investment decisions. Under an emissions-based approach, the carbon price level, as reflected in allowance
trading prices, can fluctuate depending on the allowance market. An emissions-based approach can be
designed for greater price certainty through the use of price containment mechanisms, such as a floor and
soft ceiling for prices (this is usually accompanied by a tradeoff of lower emissions certainty). Price certainty
in an emissions-based approach will also depend on policy design features such as how the emissions cap is
set, the availability of alternative compliance mechanisms (e.g., offsets), as well as other factors such as
economic conditions, relative fuel prices, and the ability of Washington residents and businesses to adopt
lower-carbon behaviors.
CERT Perspectives:
Underlying CERT deliberations was a common theme that the use of either market mechanism approach
needs to support carbon prices that are sufficiently stable to protect consumers as well as support and
attract investment. Certain CERT members highlighted Washington businesses’ successful experience
reducing their emissions and indicated that additional policy signals, such as a price on carbon, can help spur

13

additional emissions reductions. To be most effective, a carbon price should provide both low short-term
volatility and long-term certainty, as excessive volatility and long-term uncertainty can undermine the
effectiveness of a carbon price in promoting investment.
Certain CERT members suggested that a price-based approach could provide more price certainty because a
specific tax rate is placed on a unit of carbon emissions. In this context, CERT members provided the
following specific observations that a price based approach:
1. Could provide more cost effective emissions reductions and aid long-term business decision-making;
2. Makes setting a price on carbon more transparent than an emissions-based system; and
3. Appears to provide a more targeted means to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.
The potential for price volatility within an emissions-based approach was a consistent concern raised by
certain CERT members. Others suggested that the tendency of the price to respond to economic conditions
(moving downward when the economy is low and demand is soft) can be a positive feature. After hearing
from other jurisdictions about their experience, certain CERT members highlighted that a variety of policy
design options are, in theory, available to increase price stability of allowances when implementing an
emissions-based approach. In particular, the options discussed include price controls such as setting a floor
and/or ceiling on allowance prices, and market linkage to promote liquidity. However, other than a price
floor, these approaches largely remain untested in practice. Certain CERT members further suggested that an
emissions-based approach may be more stable over time, and this policy “stickiness” would provide greater
certainty to business decision-making and may result in a stronger long-term price signal. CERT members did
recognize that either approach could be vulnerable to future alterations and observed that stability of the
policy commitment over time is important to provide predictability to businesses and consumers. CERT
members also discussed the potential to provide the Governor with the flexibility to influence allowance
prices under specified conditions. Certain CERT members indicated support for this type of flexibility,
particularly to control price spikes, while other CERT members registered concern that this option, structured
into policy, would create uncertainty for both reaching emissions targets and for sustained business
investments in, for example, clean energy.

3. Minimize the implementation costs and competitiveness impacts to our businesses and industries
Background:
A comprehensive emission reduction program in Washington will have costs and benefits. While some
industries will gain competitive advantage relative to other regions, others have concerns about adverse
impacts to competitiveness due to the costs of emissions reduction. As compared to direct regulation based
on facility-specific emissions standards or particular technologies to be installed, market mechanisms aim to
provide greater compliance flexibility in an effort to lower overall cost. Market mechanisms aim to put a
price on carbon that gives businesses the option to either pay the carbon price at their current emissions
level or reduce their own emissions through any means they choose (e.g., efficiency improvements, fleet
upgrades) and pay a lower overall cost of compliance. A price-based approach, in general, provides business
with two compliance options: reduce emissions or pay the carbon price for GHGs emitted. An emissionsbased approach often provides additional options for compliance, such as allowance trading (the ability to
sell and purchase allowances), banking (buying allowances in one compliance period and holding them for
use in a later compliance period), acquisition of offsets (reducing one’s compliance obligations by purchasing
carbon credits from other sectors that are not required to do so for their own compliance obligations),
allowance price containment, and multi-year (e.g., three year) compliance periods. Also, to the extent that a

14

price-based system is inherently simpler, many of the cost containment and flexibility design features of an
emissions-based system would not be applicable. The use of offsets or banking could be, in principle, applied
to both approaches, and both approaches can offer revenue neutrality to all or select sources and individuals,
by providing, for example, a commensurate reduction in non-carbon taxes, or through a dividend/rebate
approach.
Internalizing carbon costs in Washington may be a source of competitive advantage for some businesses in
Washington, particularly insofar as Washington has a rich endowment of clean energy resources. However,
from a competitiveness impacts perspective, under either approach, certain businesses and industries in
Washington could face higher production costs compared to competitors in regions where carbon costs have
not been accounted for and internalized. In particular, energy-intensive and trade-exposed businesses and
industries are likely to face greater competitiveness risks due to a carbon price. Companies could choose to
relocate to those regions without a carbon price to maintain their competitiveness in the global marketplace;
this would lead to relocation rather than reduction of emissions, a risk referred to as “carbon leakage.” By
directing revenues (or tax rebates or exemptions or free allowances) to energy-intensive and trade-exposed
industries in Washington, market mechanisms can reduce or eliminate competitiveness concerns. Free
allowance distribution, under an emissions-based system, or tax rebates or exemptions as mentioned above,
under a price-based system, can be energy efficiency-based (or production-based). Companies would have
the potential to raise revenue by selling allowances if they reduce emissions through increases in energy
efficiency.
CERT Perspectives:
CERT members expressed substantial interest in and concern about the potential competitive impacts to
Washington industries of placing a price on carbon and expressed a need (see Finding 4) for the State to
undertake analysis to sharpen the understanding of impacts and the potential for mitigating these impacts,
including recognizing the risks to globally competitive industries. In this context, CERT members shared their
(at times differing) perspectives related to a variety of policy design features available to mitigate impacts of
concern (competitiveness and leakage impacts).
1. Regional Approach: Certain CERT members highlighted the need for Washington to take a regional
approach to better level the playing field between in-state and out-of-state companies. For example,
certain CERT members noted that there is an open question about the potential to apply border
adjustments, or border taxes, to products imported to Washington so that they face a similar
effective carbon price. Certain CERT members shared that a price-based system could be more
effective at targeting emissions from imports to the Washington economy. Other CERT members
emphasized that there are Washington industries that must compete beyond the region in national
and global markets – a regional approach would have limited or no impact on the playing field for
these companies.
2. Compliance Flexibility: Overall, CERT members understood that either a price-based or emissionsbased approach provides for greater flexibility than direct regulation and can provide for more
economically efficient emissions reductions and can add to price stability (that in turn lowers risk to
long-term business investments) as a result. Certain CERT members, however, highlighted that
emissions-based systems provide a greater range of compliance options. However, an emissionsbased program would likely have higher overall administrative costs compared to a price-based
approach – an effect potentially partially mitigated by linkage with other systems.

15

3. Offsets: CERT members discussed the use of offsets as one means to lower compliance costs (note:
although often associated with emissions-based approaches, offsets can play a role in a price-based
approach). Generally, CERT members’ observations focused on the trade-off of the flexibility offsets
can provide with the concern that they could undermine emission reductions in the covered sectors
(e.g., reduce actual emissions reductions within a state) and fail to address public health impacts, in
general, and particularly on vulnerable communities. Certain CERT members provided specific
perspectives on the use of offsets in an emissions-based policy context:
a. Strict offset protocols (e.g., stricter than those used for the California market) are desirable
to protect vulnerable communities from the potential negative consequences of offset use.
b. The State should consider adopting the California eight percent limit on the fraction of an
entity’s compliance obligations that can be met through offsets.
c. Forestry and agricultural offsets could help reduce carbon in the atmosphere while providing
new business opportunities for these economic sectors.
d. A key to maximizing the benefits of forestry offsets is to maintain the health and vitality of
Washington’s working forests.
e. It is important that all offsets be located within the United States, Mexico, or Canada (this is
the same approach as California, but it is stricter than what was suggested as part of the
WCI design framework).
f. Trading outside of the cap (or “offsetting”) can undermine the integrity of the system, can
raise environmental justice concerns, can reduce public confidence in the policy, and may
discourage necessary investments for transition and job creation in the energy sectors.
g. Offsets can support allowance price stability and thereby help reduce risk to long-term
business investments.
4. Allowances: The CERT also discussed the lessons from other emissions-based programs regarding the
distribution of allowances under an emissions-based approach. Certain CERT members provided the
following observations:
a. All or a substantial portion of allowances should be auctioned, and transportation fuels
should not receive free allowances.
b. Free allowance distribution should not lead to windfall profits for covered entities.
c. Free allocations for energy-intensive, trade exposed industries should be phased in to
provide time for a stable transition and should be pegged to efficiency.
d. The program could have initially low allowance price minimums and ceilings and/or more
modest emissions reductions requirements for initial compliance years.
e. In general, policy makers should avoid negative outcomes for early adopters. An allowance
allocation system should not disadvantage jurisdictions (in the case of multi-state programs)
or entities with a long history of investment in low-emission resources and energy efficiency
programs.
Some CERT members did express concerns that measures targeted to address costs and competitiveness for
businesses could harm consumers and communities even while they protect business interests. From this
perspective, allowing the excessive use of offsets could mean minimal actual emissions reductions in the
State of Washington, thereby excluding communities from the public health benefits associated with
emissions reductions. These CERT members further observed that rebating revenues directly to emitters
does very little to mitigate increased costs to consumers and misses the opportunity to invest in projects that
will allow Washingtonians to decrease their emissions, particularly in the transportation sector where
individual carbon emissions play a big role.

16

4. Maximize the economic development benefits and opportunities for job growth in WA
Background:
Both price-based and emission-based approaches can spur investment and employment growth in some
sectors as the shift from carbon-intensive to clean energy sources moves forward. This shift in private
investment patterns – how we spend our energy dollars – is a critical driver for the transition to a low-carbon
economy. Both price-based and emissions-based approaches can also generate revenue for the State. A
price-based system will generate tax revenues and can provide tax exemptions or commensurate tax
reductions in non-carbon taxes. An emissions-based system can generate allowance auction proceeds and
provide for targeted allowance distributions. The amount of revenue generated will depend on the carbon
price, the coverage of the policy, and the amount of tax exemptions or free allowance distributions offered
by the program. Revenues from either an emissions-based or price-based system can be directed to a variety
of purposes. These include economic development and opportunities for job growth, mitigating impacts to
consumers and low-income populations, and investments in alternative energy technologies and modes of
transportation. For example, revenues could be redirected toward small businesses and corporations by
reducing other taxes such as Washington’s B&O tax. Investment in projects that improve energy efficiency,
such as building retrofits, and reduce the carbon intensity or use of fuels, such as green infrastructure
development, public transportation, renewable energy, and low carbon fuels, could support job growth.
Revenue policy can seek to help Washington citizens avoid the rising price of fossil fuels by providing
practical, affordable energy and transportation alternatives. Job training programs targeted at Washington
residents, particularly low-income and minority residents and current employees in impacted industries and
emitting facilities, can be directed toward the needs of infrastructure investment projects and support
maximum job creation and existing job security. The degree to which either market mechanism will spur
private sector investment and contribute to economic development and job growth will depend, as noted
above, on the strength of the carbon price signal as well as the accessibility of low-carbon alternatives. The
carbon price level, price certainty, long-term stability of the carbon pricing program, and the strength of the
commitment to achieve emission limits are primary drivers of the overall effectiveness of the policy to
stimulate a shift in investment patterns and behavior.
CERT Perspectives:
CERT members in their discussions acknowledged that emissions-based and price-based systems have the
potential to generate revenue and the use of these revenues can be an important part of the design of the
market mechanism. In general, CERT member discussions reflected five areas for the possible use of any
revenues generated:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Address competitiveness impacts for trade exposed industries (e.g., fruit and aluminum producers).
Support the central emission reduction objectives of the policy.
Address any prospective adverse impacts on racial and economic equity.
Provide for measurable improvements to public health impacts, particularly in communities
impacted by emissions and low-income and minority communities.
5. Support adaptation investments to help, for example, communities strengthen resilience and
agriculture to adjust to temperature and precipitation impacts.
General observations made by certain CERT members related to the potential role and use of revenues in
support of market mechanism policy included:

17

1. The point of a carbon price is not to pay it – it is a signal to reduce carbon emissions and thereby
avoid it. Not everyone, however, is in an equal position with respect to their opportunities to
reduce emissions or their economic exposure to carbon prices. In response, policy should be
designed to facilitate the transition to an energy economy that systematically reduces carbon
emissions, with particular focus on the transition needs of workers, businesses, consumers,
families, and communities for whom the transition presents the greatest challenges. For example,
workforce development and job training development for “green jobs” could be part of policy.
2. Revenues from either system have a history of not going to the intended purposes (e.g., some
states have “raided” or “swept” these funds when economic conditions became difficult or nonsupporters assumed office). There is a need to protect the integrity of original revenue use
intentions.
3. Revenue must not fund projects that could lead to increased or sustained carbon emissions.
4. Any use of revenues needs to be calculated with the assumption that emissions will in fact decline
per the statutory limits. To avoid creating constituencies with an interest in prolonged emissions,
revenues can be recycled directly to consumers and used to provide consumers with more
practical and affordable alternatives, as well as create sustainable jobs, in order to ensure that the
program delivers results over the long haul.
5. How revenues are spent is just as important, or more so, than the actual price on carbon
emissions. The focus should be on using revenues to maximize economic efficiency. This drives a
need for an economic analysis of the impacts of revenue options that can enhance economic
growth and opportunity without risking the carbon emission reduction goals. Consideration
should be given to reducing the capital and marginal labor tax.
Certain CERT members provided the following perspectives on how revenues could be invested to maximize
economic development opportunities particularly in the context of a transition to a low carbon economy:
1. Spurring economic development in the energy efficiency/clean energy sectors, supporting
complementary actions by local governments to pursue smart growth, equitable transit oriented
development (TOD), and development of alternative transportation modes (e.g., transit, rail,
bikes, pedestrian).
2. Preservation, maintenance, and completion of major transportation corridor projects already
underway in the State that provides an equitable share between maintaining and improving
transportation infrastructure.
3. Caution was expressed about the emission impacts if the focus of transportation projects is
strictly on increased capacity, with the suggestion that, to realize a reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions from transportation will require some shift in how transportation corridors are
finished and modified (e.g., transportation corridors that prioritize high capacity vehicles and
goods movement over single occupancy vehicles, finishing HOV and transit only lanes, and
providing additional vehicle electrification infrastructure).
4. Local GHG reduction strategies such as energy efficiency retrofits, waste prevention, recycling
infrastructure, and forest protection and restoration initiatives.
5. Revenue allocation programs that include incentives and/or regulations that reward business for
energy efficiency investments made at energy intensive facilities beyond “business as usual”
(there will need to be careful accounting for real, verified emission reductions – incentives
should be narrow, focused, targeted, and have an evaluation mechanism), as well as training to
ensure existing and new workers can participate in emerging sectors.
6. Investments in electricity grid modernization.

18

7. Deployment of clean energy technologies, such as wind, biomass, solar, and nuclear.
8. Exemptions, rebates, and/or direct allocation to public transportation systems to address the
impacts of increased fuel costs due to carbon pricing.
9. Protecting agriculture from fuel price spikes, supporting ports to utilize clean fuels, and creating
dedicated goods movement corridors to address vulnerable community impacts.
10. Support traffic congestion management strategies that can also protect and provide high wage
jobs, such as building dedicated clean goods movement corridors that will allow our ports to
continue to efficiently move goods through the area.
11. Recognize that Washington State is one of the most beneficial places to invest in vehicle
electrification as our electricity is low in greenhouse gas emissions and is scheduled to become
more so with phase outs of coal fired power plants.
12. Carbon revenues should be used in ways that are consistent with the purpose of the policy –
helping to lower emissions where possible, and in no case exacerbating the problem by
increasing emissions.

5. Minimize cost impacts to consumers and protect low-income communities from increased energy
costs
Background:
Carbon market policies have the potential to be regressive, that is, impact lower income households
disproportionately. Revenues from either an emissions-based or price-based system can be directed at the
cost impacts to consumers and energy cost increases experienced by low-income communities. Using
revenues to reduce preexisting taxes (e.g., sales tax, business and occupation tax, or property tax) are a
means to adjust the net costs faced by consumers, while reductions to these taxes require taking into
account the overall tax structure. Directing revenues to fund tax rebates to low-income households or equal
lump-sum rebates (e.g., California’s “Climate Credit” to electricity ratepayers) has been directed to offset
regressive effects to lower income households. Revenues could also be used to subsidize electricity and
natural gas rates for lower income households, and/or invested in job training and infrastructure projects.
CERT Perspectives:
CERT discussions recognized the reality that adoption of a market mechanism that will set a price on carbon
will, at least in the near term, increase fossil fuel and potentially other prices to consumers and can be
regressive in nature, thereby impacting low-income communities more substantially. Within this context,
certain CERT members provided the following observations to emphasize the importance of managing for the
potential equity impacts of an emissions-based or price-based carbon emissions reduction policy.
1. Climate disruption is inequitable: those who have done the least to cause it generally suffer the
worst of its consequences – not only financially, but from a human health standpoint. Climate policy
must be designed to ease rather than exacerbate that inequity. At a bare minimum, climate policy
cannot further disadvantage low-income residents and communities of color, and policy must seek
opportunities to aim higher than the status quo. Affordable energy and transportation services and
shared economic opportunity are vital. Where climate policy might otherwise adversely affect these
imperatives, that effect must be mitigated. Where it can advance these imperatives – ensuring that
the changes necessary to tackle the climate crisis are practical and affordable for all – it must.
2. Adopt a model, perhaps comparable to the one used in California, to distribute revenue to
disadvantaged communities. Set aside 25 percent of revenues for the benefit of disadvantaged

19

communities, with 10 percent reserved for direct investment in these communities. An added CERT
reflection on this perspective pointed out the importance of defining “disadvantaged communities”
and “direct investment,” with the suggestion that, for electricity consumption, allocating funds to
customers eligible for low-income energy assistance programs could be one approach, while direct
payments could be an interpretation of “direct investment.”
3. Investment should be designed to increase access to non-carbon alternatives for low-income
communities and communities of color by reducing cost barriers and providing education about
options. In anticipation of the impending effects of climate change in low-income communities,
investment should also fund resiliency efforts.
4. Adjust for any disproportionate impacts due to increases in transportation costs for rural
communities that have a greater average Vehicle Miles Traveled.
5. Use revenues to invest in targeted mitigation strategies that help vulnerable communities meet the
increased cost of basic needs (e.g., Working Families Tax Rebate, investments in basic food, utilities,
and transportation subsidies).

6. Reduce the public health risks associated with carbon pollution, especially for vulnerable
populations
Background:
To the extent that either an emissions-based or price-based approach reduces carbon emissions, they also
can support reduction in any associated public health risks of global climate change and conventional local air
pollutants for Washington residents. The degree to which either an emissions-based or price-based approach
lowers these emissions depends on the contribution to reducing carbon emissions globally and other air
pollutant emissions (e.g., carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and hydrocarbons) associated
with carbon pollution locally. The design of a market mechanism can affect the location at which carbon and
other pollutant emissions reductions occur. This is important as often those most adversely affected by, for
example, lung health effects of climate change are living in closest proximity to pollution sources such as
transportation corridors and manufacturing facilities. Both systems are designed to provide the market with
the flexibility to reduce emissions at the location where they can be achieved at lowest cost. Whether or not
Washington’s system is linked can have implications on the degree of flexibility in the location of emissions
reductions. In a linked system, the extent to which emissions reductions will occur within Washington State
communities would be uncertain. In a price-based approach, emission reductions would have a greater
certainty to occur within the State’s borders. As a benefit to public health, revenues from either policy
approach, in principle, could be directed to alter air quality in vulnerable communities that have a high
burden of pollution.
CERT Perspectives:
CERT discussions acknowledged the potential impacts lowering carbon emissions could have on lowering the
public health impacts of other air pollutants on local communities. CERT members further recognized that
the policy actions taken by Washington will need to help spur broader action from other jurisdictions for
relief from climate impacts to emerge.
Regarding contributing to the reduction of public health impacts, certain CERT member observations
regarding the importance of reducing the public health impacts associated with carbon pollution and other
air pollutants, especially for vulnerable populations included the following.

20

1. In addition to the impacts from increases in ozone and fine particulate matter (for example, from the
four-fold increase in wildfires in the Western states in recent years), climate change will impact
human health from extreme weather events (droughts/floods); animal, water, and food-borne
diseases; food production (agricultural yields and fishing); and other factors.
2. It is a priority to ensure the environmental integrity of the cap on emissions and ensure that emitters
that have a negative environmental impact on their neighboring communities are held accountable
to those communities. It will be impossible to meet equity goals without also striving to generate
positive impacts for the communities most disproportionately impacted by emitters.
3. To ensure benefits to public health, revenues from either policy approach should be directed to alter
air quality in vulnerable communities that have a high burden of pollution. Additionally,
accountability measures that limit compliance flexibility (preferably without increasing the costs of
abatement) for emitters in highly polluted areas can provide further protections for vulnerable
communities.
4. There are important short-term public health gains related to the reduction in black carbon
emissions from diesel exhaust and wood smoke. There are a number of environmental justice
communities that are close to ports and transportation corridors that have high cancer risk and high
rates of juvenile asthma that could see substantial public health benefit from black carbon reduction
efforts. This is one area where revenue from a carbon limit should be directed.
5. An important design element of any program would be the creation of a strong Environmental
Justice Advisory Board (EJAB). For example, if the State were to adopt offsets or offer free
allowances under an emissions-based strategy, an EJAB could have the authority to review and
approve the impact of such policies on so-called EJ communities. An additional CERT perspective
indicated that EJAB authority to approve/disapprove allowances could create great uncertainty for
energy intensive globally competitive industries.
6. Climate adaptation measures should be funded. Washington must recognize that some climate
impacts are inevitable and these impacts will likely have disproportionate impact on low-income
communities and communities of color. Furthermore, the hardening of vulnerable infrastructure
(such as sewage treatment and water treatment facilities, transportation corridors, and levies and
dikes) is a much needed investment and would be a linkage the public would understand and
support.
7. A linked cap-and-trade system by definition does not guarantee that all required emissions
reductions occur within state boundaries; thus, losing some of the ancillary benefits of in-state
emissions reductions (e.g., air quality improvements) is better ensured by a price-based mechanism.

7. Allow for effective administration (oversight, regulation, monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment)
of the program and markets created or affected by it
Background:
An emissions-based approach or a price-based approach can build on existing administrative structures in the
State or the region to implement and administer the program. A price-based approach could use existing
State tax collection and enforcement structures. Drawing on existing administrative structures provides the
potential for more efficient overall administration. An emissions-based approach is administratively more
complex and would require new staffing and organizational structures but could benefit from administrative
systems already in place to service existing emissions reductions markets such as those supporting the
Quebec and California markets where allowance tracking tools, an allowance auction platform, and offset
registries exist. Using these existing administrative systems for a Washington emissions-based program

21

would very likely require linking to an existing market. (Information on the specific administrative structures
that would likely need to be identical or harmonized to a linked California-Quebec market is reviewed in the
Meeting 4 Materials. See Appendix 5.) Either approach is likely to require that Washington State agencies
develop certain new capacities and expertise to administer the program, however, a price-based approach
would very likely require significantly less than an emissions-based approach.
CERT Perspectives:
In general, CERT observations surfaced a series of themes related to the administration of a market
mechanism program:
1. A price-based approach, because of its ability to leverage existing tax administrative infrastructure
and the greater, overall simplicity would be more streamlined and efficient for the State to
implement. Related observations included:
a. The concept of a tax is better understood than a cap-and-trade system making messaging
related to a tax much more straight forward (though not necessarily uncontroversial).
b. A tax is simpler, more efficient, and a better match for Washington’s carbon emission
circumstances.
2. An emissions-based approach that is linked to the Quebec and California market would create an
opportunity to leverage existing administrative infrastructure already created by those jurisdictions,
thereby improving the efficiency of implementing the program.
3. An emissions-based program would necessitate the creation or expansion of an administrative
agency responsible for constantly monitoring market structure and constantly course correcting as
new issues arise. The costs and complexity of such a structure under the emissions-based approach
could therefore reduce revenue recycling prospects.
4. Under an emissions-based approach, there is substantial potential for market manipulation, and thus
a need for a market monitor with teeth and the costs associated with it. A market monitor and a
price cap are needed to avoid market dysfunction and associated economic dislocation.
Certain CERT members shared observations related to the importance of simplicity in policy design indicating
that political pressures will tend to drive any policy mechanism toward complexity, while simplicity is critical
for public understanding as well as for both effectiveness in the short-term and sustainability in the longterm. Related to the administration and oversight of an emissions-based approach, certain CERT members
shared that the State should consider whether it is possible to limit trading further, for instance, to only those
entities with compliance obligations.

8. Influence and catalyze national and international action
Background:
Emissions-based or price-based policy approaches provide a potential opportunity for Washington State to
contribute to, influence, and catalyze greater regional, national, and international action on carbon emissions
reduction. Broader action is vital to address the climate challenge at scale, and state and regional action has
historically played an important role in building collective will. Neighboring jurisdictions have (British
Columbia) or are discussing (Oregon) a price-based system, while other jurisdictions in the U.S. (California
and Northeast States) have an emissions-based system. If either an emissions-based or price-based system is
adopted in Washington this would serve as an example of carbon pricing as a policy designed to reduce
carbon emissions. An emissions-based approach adopted in Washington could be “linked” to the existing
Quebec and California markets (which are already linked), or a price-based approach adopted in Washington

22

could be coordinated with British Columbia to harmonize efforts and establish a common price signal across
jurisdictions. In either case, Washington would serve as an example of the potential to adopt policy
approaches that can be coordinated and, if suitably harmonized, managed for competitive disadvantages
among the linked jurisdictions that have internalized a price on carbon.
CERT Perspectives:
Overall, CERT discussions signaled that if a market mechanism is adopted in Washington, then examining
“linking” with other emissions trading markets and/or policy programs will be important, as a regional
approach can help address certain critical competitiveness concerns as well as create an important
foundation for catalyzing broader carbon emission reduction efforts by other jurisdictions. CERT input
clarified that competitiveness concerns do exist as well with jurisdictions that are unlikely to adopt price- or
emissions-based programs anytime soon. CERT perspectives on the ability of either an emissions-based or
price-based system to better support broader regional and national efforts were mixed. Certain CERT
members shared an interest in stimulating broader emissions reduction action and shared the observation
that adoption of a carbon emissions limit and market mechanism program in Washington could have the
potential to do so. Certain CERT members suggested that evaluating how well Washington’s policy
complements and integrates with other jurisdictions and how effectively it encourages greater total
investment in solutions while minimizing any additional capital investments that exacerbate the problem will
be important.
Certain CERT members observed that an emissions-based approach provided a clearer path and opportunity
to link and provide momentum to a growing regional/national market through association with the Quebec
and California market. Certain CERT members observed that a price-based approach provides comparable
opportunity through coordination with the existing British Columbia carbon tax system, and certain CERT
members noted that if discussions in Oregon lead to a price-based approach, Washington runs the risk of
missing an opportunity to participate in and show leadership for a regional price-based initiative. Certain
CERT members observed that there is also the risk, if an emissions-based policy is pursued in Washington, of
creating a programmatic checkerboard among Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, depending on
policy developments in Oregon.
Possible linkage with the Quebec and California market received focused attention by the CERT, not only in
the context of the opportunity to build momentum for further regional or national efforts, but also from the
standpoint of economic and administrative efficiency. CERT discussions about the prospects of linking to the
Quebec and California market produced the following observations in support of linkage.
1. Linkage is the only way to make a cap-and-trade system viable for Washington. The universe of
covered sources in Washington is not large enough to stand alone; linking will create a larger, more
stable market. The market will be more robust for trades and offsets, thereby increasing compliance
options and reducing compliance costs.
2. Linkage to the California system allows for leveraging existing administrative structures, thereby
lowering market operational costs relative to a Washington State-only cap-and-trade system, and
with lower administrative costs, the opportunity increases to devote resources to ensure, for
example, environmental justice priorities are met.
3. Linkage creates “stickiness” – a program in cooperation with others potentially is a more durable
commitment.
Certain CERT members observed the following considerations and concerns about linking with the Quebec
and California market.

23

1. Washington would be adopting a program designed through WCI but then primarily tailored for
another State (California) that may not well reflect Washington’s hydro-based system and
transportation-heavy carbon emissions profile.
2. The California offset approach has remained controversial and has not met objectives for availability
(as a percent of the cap), and this gap will take on more pressure with changes to the cap in 2015.
Washington will require a different approach if offsets are to be a meaningful part of the program.
3. Quantifying and capturing the benefits of the forest products sector remains a contentious issue in
the California cap-and-trade program. This creates a concern over offset opportunities, and concern
that the Washington forest products industry would be at a competitive disadvantage to California
offset projects due to a different, though no less effective, regulatory framework.
4. There will be a need to seek fair treatment for early and aggressive adopters of energy efficiency as
Washington is a leader in this arena.
5. Before launching a program, it is critical for the State to have a better understanding about how
allowances and offsets would flow between capped entities, and the comparative carbon emission
reduction cost advantage or disadvantage on Washington covered entities and the resulting pattern
of revenue flows and investments between jurisdictions participating in the market.
6. An alternative perspective was that Washington’s offset protocols must be at least as strong as those
in California if offsets are allowed at all, and that using allowance revenue to support
biosequestration in forests might be a more promising pathway than offsets.
7. Linkage represents a fundamental trade-off between increased liquidity in larger markets and loss of
autonomy. Washington State should strive to retain an appropriate degree of autonomy over any
program so that it can rapidly respond to market dysfunction if necessary.
8. Design of a linked cap-and-trade system cannot be separated from EPA’s 111(d) rule (Clean Power
Plan) for greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. Before deciding on a linked cap-andtrade program, Washington State must have clear guidance from EPA on the conversion process
between EPA’s rate-based carbon goal and the mass-based approach. In addition, policy makers
need to understand how linked markets can average the compliance cost for participating states,
and what impacts this may have on Washington State compliance costs and energy process.

4. Taskforce Findings on the Design and Implementation of a
Carbon Emissions Limits and Market Mechanism Program in
Washington
CERT member perspectives and findings for the design and implementation of a carbon emissions limit and
market mechanisms program in Washington have been informed by the CERT’s discussions and information
provided by other jurisdictions and technical experts throughout the CERT process. Several common themes
emerged from the discussions, and they are presented below as CERT findings.

CERT Finding 1: Emissions-based or price-based market mechanisms add unique features to
an overall carbon emissions reduction policy framework.
Market mechanisms, such as the emissions-based and price-based systems examined during CERT
deliberations, internalize a price on carbon, can provide coverage across a full or nearly full range of
emissions sources, and do not dictate specific, and can provide for a range of, strategies to meet compliance

24

obligations and reduce carbon emissions. Market mechanisms aim to provide greater compliance flexibility
at a lower overall cost. In this way, both mechanisms share important similarities in the context of creating
incentives for carbon emissions reductions. Utilizing either of these market mechanisms if properly
structured also holds the potential to position the State to build momentum for further action by additional
jurisdictions, thereby helping to address competitiveness concerns and broaden efforts to reduce overall
carbon emissions to a point where Washington’s economy, communities, and environment would be less
subject to the impacts of extreme weather and other greenhouse gas-related impacts. Through examining
the emissions-based and price-based approaches implemented by other jurisdictions, CERT deliberations
indicate that both come with advantages, while their disadvantages can be mitigated such that the
differences between the two can be minimized. Importantly, although these mechanisms provide unique
features, their design and any implementation requires thoughtful harmonization with Washington’s existing
and potential future policy framework.

CERT Finding 2: Thoughtful and informed policy design, drawing on the lessons learned from
other jurisdictions, CERT member perspectives, and additional analysis (see Finding 4), will be
required to achieve either an emissions-based or price-based policy approach that is workable
for the State of Washington.
A market mechanism, either emissions-based or price-based, can be a foundational element of the State’s
overall carbon emissions reduction framework in support of meeting emissions reduction targets. It is in part
in this context that the CERT has considered the design and implementation of a market mechanism policy
approach for Washington. CERT perspectives, as captured in Section 3, indicate that either an emissionsbased or price-based policy adopted by the State can help the state build a coherent carbon emission
reduction strategy that aligns private incentives in support of reaching the State’s emissions limits, while
development of any such policy also has substantial design challenges. To effectively meet the objectives
outlined in the Evaluation Framework, specific policy design elements available under either an emissionsbased or price-based policy approach will need to address the following.
1. Generating confidence in the strength and integrity of the emission reduction commitment made
through State policy to establish the certainty businesses and consumers need to achieve
Washington’s statutory carbon emissions limits.
2. Establishing carbon prices that are sufficiently stable to protect consumers as well as support and
attract investment by limiting volatility and providing long-term certainty.
3. Ensuring that the policy addresses the potential competitiveness impacts that a price placed on
carbon in Washington State (but not in other jurisdictions) might otherwise create, while maximizing
the opportunity for competitive benefits from leadership in climate solutions.
4. Considering revenue recycling options (and other incentives such as allowance distribution if an
emissions-based approach is adopted) including: 1) supporting the core emission reduction
objectives of the policy; 2) addressing any adverse impacts on vulnerable communities and
competitiveness; 3) supporting adaptation to a more resilient state in the face of more extreme
weather and other climate impact challenges; and/or 4) mitigating negative economic impacts on
people (particularly the most highly impacted, including low-income communities and communities
of color) and business and supporting economic growth strategies through targeted reductions of
existing taxes.
5. Structuring policy design to support improving local public health impacts associated with a full
range of air pollution emissions associated with burning fossil fuels.

25

6. Examining “linkage” with other jurisdictions that have established a price on carbon (either through
an emissions-based or price-based approach), as a more regional approach provides both challenges
and opportunities. Linkage can have the downside of transferring other jurisdictions’ policy priorities
and regulatory frameworks, while at the same time linkage can help address certain critical
competitiveness concerns, provide for greater administrative efficiency, as well as create an
important foundation for catalyzing broader carbon emission reduction efforts by other jurisdictions
so critical to the overall health of Washington’s economy, communities, and environment.

CERT Finding 3: Reaching the State’s statutory carbon emissions limits will require a
harmonized, comprehensive policy approach. A clear policy commitment and alignment of
private incentives will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of that approach.
The thoughtful and informed design of an emissions-based or price-based market mechanism, along with a
well harmonized set of complementary policies, can help to align incentives and provide a foundational, longterm signal in support of economically efficient shifts in energy uses and investment patterns. Such a suite of
policies will be highly interactive and needs to be built and harmonized in a cohesive and comprehensive
manner to align both the short- and long-term incentives as efficiently as possible. With a better alignment
of private incentives with the emission limits, other elements of a comprehensive policy approach can be
simpler and work more efficiently.
A market mechanism can have a special role as the “economic infrastructure” for an overall policy design by
establishing a common price signal across all emissions sources and emissions reduction opportunities.
Market mechanisms can also complement measures to improve fuel and energy efficiency by helping to
dampen the potential “rebound effect” of consumers increasing their fuel and energy usage in response to
more efficient vehicles, lighting, appliances, or other changes. Overall, the policy framework will work better
and more cost-effectively if incentives are aligned properly. With the introduction of either policy approach,
a review of the existing (and anticipated) policies will be needed to ensure the overall policy framework that
is created is well harmonized, integrated, and streamlined in order to avoid redundancy and unnecessarily
burdensome requirements, while achieving meaningful and sustained emissions reductions.
In light of Washington’s emissions profile, particular attention needs to be given to the transportation sector.
With an explicit cost placed on carbon, the price of transportation fuel will increase. At the same time,
complementary policies, along with the targeted use of revenues, will be designed to create downward
pressure on overall transportation costs by incentivizing innovation and investment which diversify fuel
sources, expand the use of low and zero emission vehicles, and expand accessible public transit. Overall, a
policy design going forward needs to address an integrated approach which considers items such as land-use
policies; equitable transit oriented development with alternatives to single occupancy vehicles such as
adequate transit, zero emissions vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicle infrastructure; the different needs of
rural communities and industries that require long distance travel; the effects on and needs of low-income
communities; and the incentives for the electric sector to take on activities like vehicle electrification that
reduce societal emissions while potentially increasing emissions in the electric sector.

CERT Finding 4: Certain important questions remain unanswered and further analysis will be
important to provide the foundation for a well informed and well-functioning policy
approach.
During CERT discussions and in written material submitted by CERT members, Taskforce members raised
questions and expressed interest in additional analysis to better inform development of specific design

26

elements of any potential market mechanism for Washington State. CERT members understand that the
State is doing further analysis as it proceeds toward a thoughtful policy design, and CERT members
encourage this further work. CERT members further believe that continued analytical work as any policy is
implemented will help define and characterize the impact of the policy on the issues described in the
Evaluation Framework. CERT members have provided a useful, though not prescriptive or comprehensive,
list of the information and analysis that could be helpful in shaping policies in Appendix 4. In general, these
information and analysis items can be grouped into four areas: completing and validating macroeconomic
analysis; refining the understanding of comparative advantage/disadvantage dynamics for Washington State
business; refining the understanding of impacts to low/middle income and vulnerable communities; and
refining the revenue picture.

Appendix 3: Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce Preliminary
Economic Analysis – Update October 2014
Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce
Preliminary Economic Analysis – Update
October 2014
At the September 9, 2014, meeting of the CERT, the state’s OFM modeling team presented preliminary
economic analysis of two examples of carbon emission pricing. The analyses were intended to illustrate
the models’ capabilities and to spur CERT dialogue on how the State should design further analyses to
inform policy design and the public debate. They were not calibrated to reflect any existing policy
preferences of either the CERT or the Governor’s office. Errors in the presentation of results reflecting
the GDP impacts of the two pricing scenarios have been corrected and the updated presentation is
available for public review at the Governor’s CERT webpage.
Analysis Objective: The goal of the Washington State Office of Financial Management, working with
consultants from ICF, was to identify a modeling approach that would improve understanding of the
impacts to household income, job growth, state productivity and energy prices of putting a price on
carbon through any of the policy mechanisms under consideration by the CERT (a carbon tax and a cap
and trade program). CERT members also asked, what sectors will experience job growth or loss? Will
there be impacts as the state transitions from more carbon-intensive processes to a greener economy?
How might the revenues from a carbon policy be best used to create jobs or income, or both?
Model Selection: The State selected two models, which, when combined, can characterize the effects of
a carbon price on emissions levels and the broader economy. These models were selected because they
are the most current tools available to characterize the dynamic relationships between energy costs and
the economy in a way that is sensitive to the particular dynamics of Washington’s economy.
1. Carbon Tax Analysis Model (CTAM): This open-source Microsoft Excel-based model initially
built for the Washington Department of Commerce is designed to forecast how energy
consumption and CO2 emissions shift when the price of those emissions changes. CTAM
calculates the price impact of a given price on carbon on each energy source in each sector of
the economy and estimates the change in consumption levels for each energy source. CTAM
captures economy wide price impacts and emissions reductions by modeling four main
sectors of energy demand: residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation, and treats
the electricity generation as an intermediate sector.
2. REMI is a best in class, dynamic forecasting and policy analysis tool. REMI is an econometric,
input-output model that can characterize complex relationships between industries in an
economy. REMI is being used here to analyze economic growth as well as income distribution
impacts - negative to positive – of different carbon prices as well as different approaches to
recycling revenue obtained through carbon pricing policy back into the economy. REMI uses
the carbon pricing and emissions data generated by CTAM as inputs in its analysis of the
broader economy.

31

Key Assumptions & Inputs: Two scenarios, a high and low carbon price, were modeled, starting in 2015
(for modeling purposes) and running through 2035 when the state must meet its second emission
reduction limit. The following assumptions and source data are important to interpreting the results.
1. CTAM requires the input of carbon prices for each year in the model run. Carbon prices in the
low price scenario began at $12 a ton (approximately the current price in the California
market) and increased $.60 annually through 2020, and $2 annually thereafter through 2035.
For the higher price scenario, prices began at $12 a ton and increase by $8 annually
thereafter. The higher price scenario reflects the model’s estimate of the price required to
generate emissions sufficient to attain the emissions reductions limits set in statute for 2020
and 2035 as if price was the sole driver of emissions reductions.
2. CTAM also requires fuel costs be input. Fuel costs were derived from Pacific Region forecast
of the Annual Energy Outlook published by the Energy Information Agency, an office of the
US Dept. of Energy that generates some of the most sophisticated energy forecasts
available. Regional gasoline and diesel prices were adjusted by modeling staff in the
Commerce Department to estimate Washington prices.
3. The “business as usual” (BAU) reference scenario assumes that a number of federal energy
efficiency policies that halt, or are set to sunset, during the modeled period, are in fact
extended. It does not incorporate the impacts of new policies under consideration such as
EPA’s newly released Clean Power Plan proposal (111D).
4. Revenue estimates assume 100% of emissions are paid for, either in the form of a carbon tax
or a in the form of 100% auction of allowances under a cap and trade program. .
5. Models do not provide for exceptional innovation or structural shifts in the economy
that significantly shift energy demand and supply patterns.
6. Additional emissions reductions from spending of revenues are not estimated.
7. Revenue recycling formula used B&O tax cuts to simulate attempts to combat leakage
through support to affected sectors. “Trade exposed industries” were identified through a
preliminary consideration of businesses that produce sizable quantities of carbon dioxide;
have significant outside competition not subject to the WA emission-reduction program or
to an equivalent program implemented in other jurisdictions; and face a substantial
percentage increase in its costs as a result of the emission-reduction program. The rest of
the recycled revenues were allocated to addressing impacts on low income communities,
transportation needs and clean electricity.
Key Findings:





Economic: The net effects of both scenarios are positive. The net statewide economic
impact on jobs, GDP and personal income under both pricing scenarios is, however, small.
Results vary more at the industry level with some industries negatively affected and
some positively affected. Again, the changes are small under both pricing scenarios.
Fuel and Energy Costs: Increasing but at different rates: natural gas the most and
gasoline increasing at a slower rate.
Emissions Under Low Price Scenario: Under the low price scenario we do not reach the 2020
or 2035 emissions reduction limits.

32




Emissions Under High Price Scenario: Under the high price scenario we hit both limits
because the carbon price was chosen so that the limits were met.
Sectors gaining most jobs (~6-20% over BAU) under both pricing scenarios include traditional
industries such as construction, chemical manufacturing, electric power generation and
transmission and iron/steel manufacturing; sectors losing jobs (~2-5% over BAU) include
natural gas, pipeline transportation and apparel manufacturing.

Next Steps: The State is working with its consulting team to prepare a second round of analyses that
may include additional pricing scenarios, model additional revenue recycling formulas and provide
additional detail on impacts to households of various income levels. Round two analyses will ask what
does the income distribution look like for the lower quintiles with energy prices up? And, to what
extent do the rebates offset the increased energy prices, gas prices and other costs of transportation?
Also, the analysis team is working to better understand the role of innovation in shaping demand,
increasing the availability of new fuel options and lowering their cost. While these analyses will not be
complete in time for CERT consideration, they will be made publicly available by the end of the year to
support continued debate over carbon pricing in Washington State.

The Honorable Jay Inslee
Office of the Governor PO
Box 40002
Olympia, WA 98504-0002 Dear
Governor Inslee:
Thank you for the opportunity to serve on the CERT, to conduct a thorough review of different models
for cap and trade and carbon taxes, and to hear a wide range of perspectives on the design of a marketbased price on GHG Emissions.
The CERT was charged with providing recommendations on the design and implementation of a carbon
emissions limit and market mechanisms program for Washington State. The CERT spent significant
time reviewing cap and trade and carbon taxes that have been implemented in Europe, Canada, and
California. Much of the CERT’s discussion about key design elements is captured in the member
perspectives, but is not reflected in the high-level consensus findings. I would like to take this
opportunity to weigh in with specific recommendations on the design, consistent with the original
charge of the CERT.
Need for Action
Climate change is the paramount challenge of this generation and has far-reaching and fundamental
consequences for our economy, environment, public health, and safety. Across Washington – and in
King County and its cities – we are already experiencing the impacts of climate change: warming
temperatures, acidifying marine waters, rising seas, decreasing mountain snowpack, and less water in
streams during the summer. These changes have the potential for significant consequences for public
and private property, resource-based economies like agriculture and forestry, health of vulnerable
populations, and numerous other issues that are important to our environment, economy, and quality of
life.
We are not on track to meet Washington State’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions limits, as committed
to by state law. Based on the information provided to the CERT and King County’s own assessments of
“what it will take” to achieve local GHG targets, I have concluded that internalizing the cost of GHG
emissions – whether through a cap-and-trade

39

program similar to the one adopted in California or a carbon tax as adopted in British Columbia – is
essential to the State’s overall strategy to reduce GHG emissions.
Initial modeling done by the State in support of the CERT indicates a net minor, but positive, statewide
effect of modeled carbon pricing scenarios on jobs, GDP, and personal income.
These findings are consistent with other market-based programs around the U.S. and world that are
showing economic benefits to establishing a market based price on carbon. By internalizing the cost of
climate pollution, both a cap and trade and carbon tax should spur innovation, investment, and growth in
the clean energy and technology sectors in Washington State.
In addition to the direct economic benefits that will come with a thoughtfully implemented marketbased policy, there will be concurrent and important co-benefits from Washington’s effort to reduce
GHG pollution. For example, reducing fossil fuel use in transportation will not only reduce GHG
emissions, but will also reduce air pollution and associated health impacts, such as asthma risk.
We have enough information about the performance of models from other regions, as well as analysis of
likely outcomes in a Washington State context, to proceed with thoughtful, informed design and
enactment of a successful and effective Washington State policy.
Relationship to Local Actions
The decisions we make locally and regionally, such as where our communities will grow and how they
will be served by transportation, will set the stage for success or failure in reducing GHG pollution and
ensuring our communities are livable and resilient to climate change impacts.
Local governments will play a critical role in progress towards the State GHG requirements, and many
Washington cities and counties are taking action. In July 2014, the King County Growth Management
Planning Council – a formal body of elected officials from across King County and its 39 cities – voted
unanimously to adopt a shared target to reduce countywide sources of GHG emissions, compared to a
2007 baseline, by 25 percent by 2020, 50 percent by 2030, and 80 percent by 2050. These goals are
even more ambitious than the State’s reduction limits.
Since these targets were adopted, elected officials from many of these cities – through a regional
partnership known as the King County-Cities Climate Collaboration (K4C) – have come together to
chart out and formally agree to a set of joint actions to help reach these targets. There is much we can
and must do at the local level to reduce emissions, from pursuing transit-oriented development to
adopting green building standards. But we’ve also highlighted the essential role of a market-based price
on carbon pollution and other GHG emissions to send a broader price signal that would reduce fuel use
and drive investment in energy efficiency and clean technologies. Reinvestment of a portion of the
revenue from the

40

market-based programs would further leverage local GHG reduction efforts, such as expanded transit
service, energy efficiency projects, and forest protection and restoration initiatives.
Recommendations
 Ease the transition: While the shift to a market-based approach to reduce GHG pollution is
essential, the state should reduce impacts to low income families and individuals through
provisions such as offsetting tax reductions and credits.



Include transportation: The transportation sector is the largest source of GHG emissions in
Washington State, comprising almost half of the State’s emissions, and must be covered under a
market-based policy. Because of the heavy reliance in Washington State on fossil fuel energy for
transportation, additional complementary actions will be needed to achieve deep reductions for
this sector. Overall, a policy design going forward needs to consider an integrated approach which
supports efficient land-use policies, transit oriented development, and alternatives to current single
occupancy vehicles such as transit, zero emissions vehicles, and alternative fuels.



Carefully design allowances and exemptions: It will be important to design a market- based
program that ensures a smart transition to cleaner energy sources for fossil fuel based industries,
but also a program that learns from other cap and trade and carbon tax programs and does not
give windfall profits to fossil fuel based industries or delay action to reduce emissions in these
sectors of the economy. In addition, the design should provide allowances or exemptions for
actions that are fuel and energy dependent, but provide significant community scale reductions in
GHG emissions, such as transit service.



Reinvest in actions that reduce GHG emissions: A substantial share of revenues generated by
either an emissions or price-based market mechanism should be invested in actions that reduce
GHG emissions and help communities prepare for the impacts of climate change. For example,
California’s cap and trade program helps fund local transit service and operations, recognizing
the GHG reduction benefits that transit provides by reducing congestion, providing alternatives to
cars, and supporting efficient land use and transit-oriented development. Because a market-based
solution should not be relied on to achieve all the State’s GHG reductions, it will be important to
reinvest a significant portion of the program’s revenue into efforts that support further reductions
beyond the impact of the price on carbon.

41

The time for action is now to protect the future of our environment and public health and safety, and to
position Washington State to attract investment and economic development in clean energy and 21st
century technology.

Dow Constantine

RE:

CERT R E P O RT A T T RI BU TE D C O MME NT S

I thank you, Governor Inslee, for the opportunity to participate in the Carbon Emissions
Reduction Taskforce. I also want to thank the other taskforce members, who brought strong
and varied perspectives to the taskforce proceedings. I appreciated the opportunity to share
my thoughts and opinions to this important public policy development.
Our charge was to provide recommendations “on the design and implementation of carbon
emissions limits and market mechanisms program for Washington.” After six months of
deliberations, our final report takes an important step in that direction but falls short on
recommending a specific market mechanism. I agree with the findings in the report, even
though my expectation was for the Taskforce to act more decisively in recommending a
particular market mechanism for carbon reduction.
During our deliberations, the world has again been reminded by its most prominent scientists
that action on reducing carbon emissions is imperative if we are to avoid catastrophic impacts
to our global ecosystems. As stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
“Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes
in all components of the climate system, increasing the likelihood of severe, pervasive and
irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems. Limiting climate change would require
substantial and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions which, together with
adaptation, can limit climate change risks. Substantial emissions reductions over the next few
decades can reduce climate risks in the 21st century and beyond, increase prospects for effective
adaptation, reduce the costs and challenges of mitigation in the longer term, and contribute to
climate-resilient pathways for sustainable development.”
In the northwest, we are just beginning to experience the effects of a changing climate.
Industries in Washington State such as shellfish, forestry, agriculture and health care are
dealing with the adverse effects of climate change today.
There are some who argue that Washington’s emissions are a small part of a global problem,
and that our efforts will lack meaning and effectiveness. I argue the opposite. The tragedy of
the commons that we are experiencing can only be solved by universal action. Our leadership
in this respect is not only essential, but will serve our region well as early adopters.
Given the magnitude of the challenge in front of us, I urge you to authorize the appropriate
analyses called for in Finding 4 of this report, and then to work with haste to put forward a

43

market mechanism to reduce carbon emissions. As concluded last year by the Climate
Legislative and Executive Workgroup (CLEW), Washington will not be able to achieve its carbon
reduction targets without additional, market-wide actions. Furthermore, as the IPCC notes,
every year we delay in implementing policies, the magnitude of the challenge escalates.
Beyond the environmental issues, I believe that we have an economic imperative to be a leader
in creating a clean energy economy. Currently, Washingtonians spend $20 billion on energy to
heat and cool our buildings, power our industries and fuel our transportation system. Upwards
of 86% of this energy spend is wasted through inefficiencies—that’s over $16 billion. Imagine
the economic development potential of reinvesting $16 billion into our local economies every
year.
Much of this wasted energy is emitted as carbon pollution into our atmosphere. Putting a price
on this carbon pollution will send the correct market signals across our economy to reduce
wasted energy. As we do this, our economy will be strengthened. The economic analysis
conducted during the CERT confirms this. Even at the highest estimate of a carbon price, rising
to over ten times the current cost in California, the modeling confirms that every economic
indicator for Washington is improved—personal income, State GDP and jobs.
One of the reasons this will occur is that we are able to dramatically increase the efficiency of
how we use energy. Despite a rise in price, we can reduce how much we spend on energy by
investing in more efficient technologies.
Emissions in the transportation give us one example. The economic modeling suggests that a
price on carbon will increase gasoline prices between 40 cents and $1.50 by 2030. That
translates into an annual increase between .67% and 2.5%. During the next ten years, however,
the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles will improve 5%. We can further increase the
efficiency of our transportation energy by transitioning to electricity. An electric-drive vehicle is
3 to 4 times as efficient as an internal combustion, mechanical-drive vehicle.
A similar situation occurs in our built environment. A carbon price will increase the cost of
heating, cooling and lighting buildings, based on the fossil content of the fuels used. We know,
however, that homes and commercial buildings routinely waste 20-50% of the energy they
consume. By investing in building efficiencies, we can re-direct our wasted spending into
creating family wage jobs in our local communities.
This imperative for economic sustainability is what is driving, in part, many leading Washington
businesses to call for immediate action on climate change. Representing MacDonald Miller, I
joined over 100 Washington businesses this month in signing the Washington Business Climate
Declaration. The declaration begins with the statement that “there is a clear and present need
for climate action to protect our region’s natural assets, its vibrant communities and its growing
economy.”

44

In addition to MacDonald- Miller, companies like Microsoft, Virginia Mason, Seattle Chamber,
Saltchuck and REI urged policymakers to “support using energy efficiently, investing in cleaner
fuels, advancing renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gases”. These companies
understand that squeezing the waste out of our economy will spur investments in innovation
and will create jobs in our communities. Our competitive advantage is to be first movers and to
benefit from the innovations that we will develop.
As one of the business owners at this table, I know that price is key. We cannot fully unleash
our innovative potential if we continue to allow unmitigated carbon pollution for free. It is
costing all of us in the degradation of our economy and our planet. Putting a price on carbon
pollution—either through a direct price or through an emissions mechanism—is a reasonable
policy to invigorate a rational economic response to carbon emission and $16 billion of wasted
energy just in our very own Evergreen State.
I remain optimistic and confident that the know-how to construct an effective carbon emissions
reduction policy framework exists today. Without any question, it will require additional
research and business testing prior to formalizing; however, there is no reason we cannot craft
this policy framework based on what is already known and effectively consolidated in the draft
CERT Report.
I look forward to being a catalyst of sound business reason to move this discussion forward into
real and meaningful policy action.

MEMORANDUM
To: Governor Jay Inslee, Chris Davis, Keith Phillips, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce
From: KC Golden, Senior Policy Advisor, Climate Solutions
Re: Comments on the CERT Report
__________________________________________________________________________________
Thank you for the opportunity to serve on the CERT. Having served on a number of such task forces, I
particularly appreciate that this one squarely tackled the core issue – how to put responsible limits on
climate pollution and internalize the cost of emitting it. It is no surprise that this is the toughest climate
policy issue, because it’s the most important one.
In the CERT process, we consciously skipped the science, because the “debate” has already gone on for
too long. But as we go forward, our success depends on the strength of our commitment to overcome
political obstacles. So it’s worth a quick look what happens if we don’t. (Bummer alert.) The most
pressing question, in the wake of the recent IPCC report, seems to be: “Is it too late?” I get this
question all the time, and there’s a simple answer: No! But it sure as hell isn’t too early.
The slightly more complicated answer is that our weak response to date guarantees that we will
experience some costly and disturbing climate impacts. We already are. But the difference between a)
doing what is necessary to stabilize the climate from here forward and b) failing to do so is the difference
between two quite different planets. The IPCC’s synthesis report illustrates this difference clearly:

On the left is a planet we can recognize as Earth, a planet that will have to cope with very significant but
potentially manageable climate impacts. The opportunity for our grandchildren to live on this Earth can
only be preserved with a rapid and bold transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. We obviously can’t
do it all in Washington, but the fact that we have already taken some meaningful steps – and that we
enjoy a relatively low-carbon, low-cost electric power system – should give us the confidence to lead,
rather than an excuse to dither.
On the right we have a planet that would be so radically transfigured in this century by climate
disruption that we would have to give it a new name, say, planet Toast. It is roughly the path we’re on.
Kevin Anderson, director of UK’s Tyndall Center for Climate Change, says this path “is incompatible with
organized global community, is likely to be beyond ‘adaptation’, is devastating to the majority of

46

ecosystems and has a high probability of not being stable (i.e. 4-degrees Centigrade, [7-degrees
Fahrenheit] would be an interim temperature on the way to a much higher equilibrium.)”
Millions of people are scrambling now to rebuild their lives in the wake of intensifying climate-related
disasters, and we’ve “only” raised the average global temperature by less than 1 degree C. This isn’t
hypothetical. There are victims, now. And there are the prospective victims of still preventable disasters
– our kids and theirs. If my comments reflect impatience, it’s because I’m increasingly disturbed by how
comfortable, fortunate people (myself included) – people with immense capacity and responsibility for
delivering solutions – inch forward so timidly while significant and growing populations who did little to
cause the problem are ravaged by floods, storms, droughts.
Our report is cautious and tentative, as any consensus document on this politically charged subject is apt
to be. But if our collective determination to move forward with a responsible climate policy is no
stronger than the language in this report, then make your reservations for Toast. Because – cue
elephant in room – serious climate action is contrary to the interests of the fossil fuel industry, and they
will fight with all their concentrated economic and political power to stop it.
This is to be expected. Asking them to do otherwise would be like asking bees to get out of the honey
business. And if this were just another “win some, lose some” business proposition or political contest,
maybe we wouldn’t have to get too worked up about it. But since the choice is between Earth and
Toast, we might want to consider whether we will let the financial interests of fossil fuel companies
continue to dominate our climate policy. So, I feel compelled1 to ground us back in physical reality. One
way or the other it will trump whatever stories we tell ourselves about “political reality.”
Now, if the financial interests of the fossil fuel industry and the economic interests of Washington State
were the same, then we would have a much more complicated problem. But the modeling conducted
for the CERT shows clearly that they are not. Even in the extremely unrealistic case where carbon prices
were very high and we did nothing else to respond – no new policies, no innovation, no rational
adjustments – the impact on the economy would be very modest and on balance positive. (And that’s
without even counting the benefits of living on Earth instead of Toast.)
More realistically, instead of paying higher prices for fossil fuels, we would continue to develop better,
cheaper alternatives to fossil fuel. We would reduce the immense drain on Washington’s economy –
over $15 billion annually – associated with importing fossil fuels. Instead of surrendering that money at
the gas pump, where most of it is directly evacuated from our communities and businesses, we’d spend
more of it here, creating more jobs and economic opportunity for Washingtonians. As the clean energy
transition gains momentum globally, we’d position ourselves to compete and win in the biggest energy
technology markets of the future. It’s not hard to imagine a smarter and more robust strategy for
shared prosperity and healthy communities than resigning ourselves to fossil fuel dependence.
1

My professional obligation to remind us of this depressing situation may explain the pathetic state of my social life. I promise, if you invite
me to your party, I won’t mention the IPCC report once. But here, well, I kind of have to. Because it affirms that there is something more
difficult and distasteful than overcoming the political obstacles to climate policy. And it’s barreling toward us as we waffle. Washington has
had its share of previews – fires, floods, ocean acidification…. Those who would forestall action can quibble about attribution of a specific
event, but the science is clear: unless we tackle climate change hard, we will careen into more of this misery.

47

Oil interests will stoke fear with the claim that internalizing the cost of carbon will increase energy costs
to consumers. (And on the subject of raising gas prices, their expertise should not be underestimated.)
But the purpose of internalizing these costs is precisely so we DON’T have to pay them. The idea that
we will sit still for higher gas prices (and climate devastation) rests on the assumption that oil companies
have us over a barrel – that we have no choice but to pay whatever they charge and suffer the climate
consequences. And indeed, with or without an explicit carbon price, they will always charge as much as
they can, optimizing near-term profits and long-term dependence on fossil fuels. That’s just business.2
The truth of course is that only where costs are internalized can markets function to minimize them.
The total cost of fossil fuels – including the cost of escalating climate and health impacts – is exorbitant,
and all the more unbearable because we foist most of it onto our kids. These “external” costs amount
to an enormous subsidy for fossil fuels, on top of the direct subsidies they enjoy. Only when prices tell
the truth about those costs can we efficiently deliver and choose cost-effective alternatives.
The only genuinely powerful, effective strategy available to consumers and businesses to reduce our
exposure to fossil fuel prices is to give ourselves more good choices – to develop an array of
convenient, affordable alternatives to fossil fuels. An explicit climate policy – responsible limits on
climate pollution and an end to free carbon dumping – would unleash our power to develop more and
better alternatives, to gradually and economically end our dependence on fossil fuels. It would send a
clear, technology-neutral market signal for greater private and public investment in efficiency, clean
fuels, transit, electric vehicles, renewables, and other transportation and energy choices. It would
generate revenue that could be used to give us more and better options – especially for those
businesses and individuals who are most exposed to fossil fuel costs and most in need of good
alternatives. And it would signal to other jurisdictions – who also worry about competitive position –
that we are prepared to move forward together, as our neighbors in BC and California have done3.
As we reduce demand globally for fossil fuels, we will apply downward pressure on the price that
producers can charge (hence their steadfast opposition). Only when we lack alternatives can fossil fuel
suppliers run their prices up. And once again, according to the modeling done for the CERT, even if we
do nothing to adapt, innovate, and deliver better solutions, an explicit carbon price – even a very high
one – would have a modest and positive net economic impact.
It would, however, result in changes. And even if the net impacts are positive, they won’t necessarily
be positive for everyone. So it’s absolutely imperative that climate solutions be fair, opening pathways
to sustainable, broadly-shared prosperity and a just transition. The opportunities here are exceptionally
bright, since fossil fuel expenditures produce fewer jobs and more narrowly concentrated benefits than
any other energy strategy. Climate policy must start from the recognition that climate disruption itself is
a grave injustice. Those who do the least to cause it often suffer the worst of its impacts. Policy design
must address that injustice squarely. Briefly, it must:
2

Their war on reason, however, is beyond the pale. See, e.g., “The Self-Interest in Climate Denial”; Merchants of Doubt; “’Dark Money’ Funds
Climate Change Denial Effort”; “Steve Coll: How Exxon Shaped the Climate Debate”….ad nauseum.

National leadership would of course be ideal. But suggesting that we should wait for it no longer passes the laugh test. Concerted action on
the west coast can lead the way.

maximize the opportunity for broadly-shared prosperity and public health in the transition from
fossil fuels to clean energy;
accelerate private and public investment in practical alternatives to fossil fuel dependence;

industries, facilitating a just and effective transition. I echo and support the principles for
climate justice that Rich Stolz has offered, as well as the accommodations for trade-exposed
industries that others have offered.
reliably and transparently deliver on our commitment to achieve responsible, science-based
emission limits. No loopholes, no negotiating with physics.

I will refrain from further comments on policy design, appreciating and supporting the many good
insights of the group, and anticipating plenty of discussion to come. I would refer folks to the excellent
ongoing work of the Sightline Institute in analyzing our options and clarifying our choices.
…Look, this isn’t easy, but it’s not as hard as we’re making it. The concerns and reservations we’ve aired
are fair and legitimate. Climate policy and the energy transition it will drive represent a significant
economic shift; we must take care to avoid new hardships and seize new economic opportunities,
especially for economically vulnerable people, communities, and businesses. After this process and the
many task forces that preceded it, we are better prepared to move forward thoughtfully.
That word “thoughtful” appears a great many times in our report, and no one could fairly accuse us of
less. But they could accuse of being too hesitant, too complacent, too slow to tackle the challenge with
all the determination we’ll need.
Our deliberations to date, and for decades, are the kind of conversations they might have had up until
December 6, 1941, about the gathering storm of fascism. Only now it’s December 7; that’s the
takeaway of the IPCC report. I’ve been tempted on many occasions as we discussed one or another
potential pitfall of climate policy to say, “Well, what if we had to?”… in the same way that our parents
and grandparents “had to” after Pearl Harbor, and rose up from a tentative, Depression-scarred national
funk to become America’s “greatest generation” in response to that necessity.
Any fair reading of the science says we have to. Any serious analysis of the costs and benefits of climate
solutions relative to climate chaos says we have to. Any defensible interpretation of the
intergenerational contract says we have to. And anyone with a healthy confidence in the extraordinary
capacity of the people and businesses of Washington to deliver solutions knows we damned well can.
So, with immense appreciation and respect for the genuine commitment of everyone who spent so
much time and effort on this process, for Heaven’s sake, let’s go.

To: Governor Jay Inslee
From: Jay Gordon, Dairy Farmer
RE: Perspective for CERT report carbon reduction and pathways forward
Dear Governor Inslee,
Thank you for the opportunity to serve on the Carbon Emission Reduction Taskforce (CERT) the past
6 months. The question of how we as a state respond to climate change, carbon emission reduction and
future energy supplies is important, complex and daunting. I generally agree with the four broad
findings in the CERT report with the usual caveat that the devil is in the details. You asked me to advise
you on the impacts and opportunities that I saw to and for Agriculture from the proposals considered in
the CERT process. We were asked and I offer these personal perspectives on challenges, opportunities,
questions, concerns and process as one of the CERT committee, as a farmer and as a rural citizen of our
state.
Here is a quote that provides a backdrop of my perspective of how daunting the pathway is:
“Today’s farmer will have to double the global food supply using half the water, far less land area
and exhausted soils, without fossil fuels, with very costly fertiliser, with limited technology, spreading
diseases and pests, under the hammer of an erratic climate.”
Julian Cribb, Author “The Coming Famine”
In addition to feeding a hungry planet we add the challenge of finding massive energy sources to
replace carbon-based fuels. Moving away from fossil fuels across this planet after hundreds of years of
use will be neither easy nor fast. That being said it is nevertheless important for a multitude of reasons.
How and which pathway to choose on this challenging transition is a core question. I believe the
private sector can and will play the major role. As such my first suggestion is that this discussion
should be enlarged significantly to include a much broader group of stakeholder such as innovators,
businesses, policy makers and more sources of information about solutions. Our country and definitely
our state is one that welcomes discovery through and from debate and discussion.
The CERT process and report left me with more questions than answers. But here are some thoughts,
starting with the most most intuitive directions:
Transportation improvements are needed. – congestion costs time, money, productivity and carbon.
Encourage innovation, deployment and support for alternative transport fuels. We are seeing offerings
of electric cars and CNG trucks, while government policy shouldn't pick winners in alternative fuels, it
can assist. Your Executive Order outlines this pathway as well.
Continued incentives and encouragement for conservation – There are federal funds to partner with on
these conservation efforts across a broad spectrum – housing, business, farms and industrial. Broader
awareness of of these incentive opportunities would be helpful.
Now into the weeds a bit.

A cap and trade process does not seem a good fit for Washington. Washington emissions are already
very low and moving lower, thanks to broad adaptation of energy reduction investments, more efficient
vehicles, and a transition from coal to natural gas for electricity generation. Reducing already low
Washington State emissions across very few emitting sectors requires different considerations than say
New England or California. Cap and Trade is an incredibly complex, bureaucratic process that I submit
will be administratively costly and a poor fit for our economy or state. Transportation is our largest
carbon emitter. Cap and trade schemes have not proven, yet, to be a viable model alone to reduce
transportation based carbon. California will engage in finding out if it works in 2015.
The simplicity of a carbon tax scheme – especially a strict revenue neutral program such as British
Columbia – is appealing...but simple may not mean correct. But the CERT process left me with
unanswered concerns and questions on carbon taxes. The CERT process was not extensive enough for
me to answer – with any confidence- the very question you charged me with answering. I.e. What
impacts are there to Agriculture? A carbon tax scheme was modeled but it was a simplistic model. At
the very last CERT meeting there were still significant unanswered questions about impacts on our
economy from loading large carbon taxes on fuel – the modeling was too simplistic and left CERT
members wanting more. My specific concerns within rural Washington and agriculture are for
economic viability/vitality specifically if natural gas and transportation fuels are heavily taxed. Natural
gas is essential to food processors, such as drying dairy products, potato processing, pulp and paper,
etc. There is no viable replacement today for CNG that I know of. I am not an expert and suggest the
important specific sectors like timber, food processors and more farm sectors MUST be engaged in
discussion on short and long term impacts to these important sectors of our economy, especially our
rural economy.
Rural driving patterns are different than urban areas with little solution to be found in public
transportation or electric cars. Without a viable energy replacement and the time to make capital
investments for these sectors the carbon tax simply becomes a tax without an avoidance plan or “offramp”. The rural community I live in, is timber dependent, the same concerns for viability in
agriculture applies to timber. These two significant portions of our rural economies are at risk of
reduced competitiveness since they both are inextricably tied to international prices and competition. I
am not comfortable speaking on the impacts to all farm sectors, let alone our food processors or the
other important sectors of our rural economy. The economic modeling must be deepened and the
discussions and modeling inputs broadened to gain the understanding we must have before we take
additional policy steps in carbon reduction like a carbon tax.
Innovation - I submit that Washington has done a good job of encouraging alternative fuel, but we are
not there yet....Consider accelerating – where budgets allow – more innovation and incentives to
develop and deploy commercially viable technologies that offer alternatives to transition to especially
in transportation. If history is any guide, it’s impossible for us to know today what breakthrough
technologies will be present 10 years from now that revolutionize the transportation sector. As
referenced in the last CERT meeting, government and economist forecasting of the impact of future
technologies on energy use is limited or imprecise. They normally undervalue the impact considerably.
I am familiar with the process of using taxes to alter behavior, having experienced the transition away
from ozone depleting freon. The goal of eliminating R-12 was similar and just as critical as carbon
reduction but there are differences. There were readily available alternatives to R-12. The time line of
increasing tax load on R-12 was gradual such that capital purchases of replacement equipment – which
used new, ozone safe, refrigerants could be phased out – without significant economic effects.

51

Carbon based fuels are much more insidious than Freon in our lives and economy. Fuel substitutes,
while available and being adopted are not nearly sufficient. The goal is to reduce carbon, in lieu of
collecting taxes or auction proceeds – BUT right now the alternative choices to fossil fuel energy
supplies are NOT growing fast enough. Example, while we have seen new vehicles offered that are low
carbon (high mileage) or low carbon electrics. Battery technology has not advanced yet to entice
adoption of electric cars significantly. We have only just seen truck manufacturers release natural gas
power options in semis and farm tractors. Adoption and deployment of CNG powered heavy equipment
will face the economic scrutiny of thousands of businesses as they ponder the capital equation of repowering and consider fueling station availability. To repeat- alternatives to high carbon fossil fuels are
needed. Let’s make sure we have different “Lilly pads” for folks to jump to.
I must mention one big caveat – biofuel crops may well have a place in the mix, but caution must be
exercised – we are limited to the farmland we have- they don't make it anymore. I have seen the
changes that corn based ethanol mandates have brought across America, costs have gone up for feed. I
have heard about the similar feed cost increases of biofuel crops in Europe. Farmers are asked to
provide Food, Fiber and Feed or the world, adding more Fuel crops to this list should be done
cautiously. I am not saying not to look to biofuels like cellolostic ethanol or bio-diesel, just urging
caution. I am optimistic we will soon make advances into renewable compressed natural gas from
methane digesters on dairy farms that do not add crop competition to existing cropping.
Adaptation- while the CERT process was tasked with exclusively emission reduction, adaptation
simply has to be part of any discussion. Budgets are tight and choices are inevitable. The Federal help for projects and communities – has diminished in both capacity and ability. Given these realities and
given what is increasingly clear data and evidence that the climate has and is changing. ( I.E. Data
clearly shows increased flooding frequency and flood levels in Western Washington since the 1980's.
Science indicates these increases are consistent with increasing atmospheric particulates. The same
particulate science that shows increased wetter wet events ALSO indicates that increased atmospheric
particulates also tend to make dry patterns drier...increased frequency of drought on the east side or
drier summers on westside).
The question arises how to prioritize adaptation such as flood and drought preparation, or wildfire
preparation/prevention. Floods, droughts and fire affect the rural communities and the farms and forests
that provide the jobs or taxes in much of rural Washington. Based on my very limited experience I
submit that carbon reduction is a separate but related issue to adaptation. Decisions on carbon reduction
policy, implementation, deployment, or revenues should be kept separate. Carbon reduction means
continuing to learn how to live with less fossil fuel, dealing with particulate enhanced floods and
droughts now and in the foreseeable future is urgent. One is a snake in the grass, the other is in your
shirt!

To: Governor Jay Inslee and the CERT Taskforce
From: Jeffrey Johnson, President, Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO
Re: Comments and Policy Considerations

We face two systemic crises today, climate disruption and extreme inequality, and, thus far,
a failed public response adequately addressing either of them.
Disruptive climate change threatens our jobs, our health, our economy and our
communities. It is an existential crisis that in the words of U.N. Secretary General Ban Kimoon must be addressed now since "there is no plan B, because we do not have planet B."
Nonetheless tens of billions of dollars in tax incentives are given to fossil fuel companies to
search for more oil, gas, and coal reserves, while to prevent global climate temperature
from rising two degrees, two-thirds of current reserves need to be left in the ground.
Extreme income and wealth inequality has expanded the ranks of the poor, dismantled the
middle class, and far too often has eroded our sense of common purpose and the belief that
we can make big changes that restore a measure of shared prosperity.
The impact of climate disaster, while bad for everyone, will fall disproportionately on the
poor and communities of color, the very people who will be least able to afford the cost of
transitioning to a new energy economy.
The impacts of mitigating climate disaster will also significantly affect workers and
communities that have been fossil fuel dependent. Workers and their families whose wages,
health care and pensions are dependent on fossil fuel production and distribution and their
communities need to be provided a real social safety net not vague references to a "just
transition."

53

Given my limited background in climate policy and the brevity of the CERT process, I can't
claim to know whether a carbon tax or a cap and trade system or some hybrid model is best
suited for lowering Washington's carbon emissions, I would, however, like to suggest some
thoughts and core values that I think must be addressed in any carbon reduction regime.
At the outset for purposes of full disclosure, I have read both One America's report and the
report submitted by the Budget and Policy Center and SEIU 775 and find myself in
agreement with most of their comments and specific policy suggestions.

Thoughts and Core values:
1. The science on climate is settled. We have a crisis and we need to deal with it now or

suffer the consequences - with those who had the least to do with causing the
problem bearing the greatest cost.
2. Reversing climate crisis and extreme inequality are inextricably linked. The lens

through which we need to look is one that views a future in which our public policy
decisions, and the private investment decisions they leverage, create a shared
prosperity while we create a sustainable environment for the future.
3. The sooner a price is set on carbon, the sooner we will be able to lower carbon

emissions. Which market mechanism is best, should be determined by what actually
lowers carbon emissions enough to meet the goals that we have set for ourselves as a
State. The actual carbon emission target levels we are trying to hit ought to be reevaluated and reset on a regular basis.
4. We need a set of policies that minimize leakage - the movement of production and

jobs out of state - and that treat imports of energy as if they were produced in
Washington State. The goal needs to level the playing field between in-state and outof-state producers so that we can maintain jobs and truly meet our carbon emission
levels.
5. Create an Economic Justice and Environmental Equity Board made up of

representatives from highly impacted communities ( low income, communities of
color, front line workers in fossil fuel dependent communities) from around the state
to monitor the suite of policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions and to
recommend policy changes with regards to investing carbon revenues in a way that

54

maximizes equity, job creation, positive health outcomes, and further carbon
emission reduction.
6. Revenues from carbon pricing need to be used to:
7. Protect low income, middle income, and communities of color from rising fuel and

energy costs as the transition to a new energy economy proceeds and subsidize
energy retrofits.
8. Provide income and benefit protection and retraining funds for fossil fuel dependent

workers.
9. Protect the social safety net in fossil fuel dependent communities impacted by a

transition to a new energy based economy.
10. Create public investment (and leveraging private investment) in new energy

economy infrastructure (solar, wind, geothermal, wave, bio-mass, smart grids, etc),
transit-oriented development, mass transit, high speed rail, repairing Washington
State's infrastructure, and taking to scale public, commercial, and residential energy
retrofits, etc.
11. Prioritize public investment in environmental "hotspots" to address serious pollution

related public health issues and to create new energy economy job growth and
economic benefit
12. Promote domestic content and domestically sourced products when investing public

dollars in infrastructure development
13. Promote the use of state certified highly trained and skilled labor, and apprentice

utilization standards, in rebuilding infrastructure projects
14. Build into the state's carbon price economic modeling the impact of the full suite of

existing carbon reduction policies and potential policies to get the best measure of
price needed to meet carbon emission reduction levels.
15. Act now.

MEMORANDUM
To:

Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce; Governor Jay Inslee

From: Renee Klein, President & CEO, American Lung Association of the Mountain Pacific
Re:

Comments on the CERT Report

It has been a privilege to participate in the Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce. As we submit our report to
the governor and he considers legislative recommendations, my concern is not which market mechanism will
best meet our statutory carbon limits (each has merits and weaknesses), it is that our state has the political will
for action.
Too often when we are deep in debate over cap-and-trade vs. carbon tax we lose sight of the single greatest
reason to act: to protect human health. Poor air quality, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, stronger storms, more
intense and longer droughts, more frequent heat waves, wildfires and other public health threats will affect the
lives of Washingtonians for generations to come.
The most vulnerable populations include the elderly, pregnant women, low income and minority communities,
people with chronic illnesses … and of course our children. Looking just at the respiratory impacts of climate
change, children breathe deeper than adults so pound for pound they inhale more toxic pollutants than adults;
what can make an eight year old cough can literally make an infant stop breathing.
The American Lung Association’s 2014 State of the Air Report found that nearly half of the people in the United
States (147.6 million) live with unhealthy levels of ozone or particle pollution, nearly 16 million more than in the
previous year’s report. This confirms that warmer temperatures increased ozone pollution in large areas across
the U.S. Ground level ozone is associated with many respiratory diseases and is even harmful to healthy people.
Ozone can also affect the heart, leading to cardiac arrhythmia and heart attacks. It also can increase the number
of low birth-weight babies in mothers exposed to high levels during pregnancy, as well as contribute to other
infant health issues.
Episodes of drought, and particularly for our state, wildfires, threaten public health as clouds of dust and smoke
with particulate matter can shorten life. Extreme weather events leave families living in damp homes, inhaling
mold or soot as they recover. Longer pollen seasons release allergens that can worsen lung diseases.
Asthma, for example, has become an epidemic over the last three decades. It is the most common chronic
pediatric disease, and Washington already has one of the highest adult asthma rates in the nation. In 2010,
more than 100 Washingtonians were hospitalized every week from asthma, and we paid $73 million in asthmarelated hospital expenses. 60% of those expenses were paid for via public funds – Medicare and Medicaid – and
nearly one-quarter of asthmatic adults missed work for $4.3 million personal days of lost productivity. So in
addition to the human toll, there is a cost – a hidden tax if you will – associated with our dependence on fossil
fuels and climate warming. And that’s just looking at one chronic disease.
Fortunately there is also a return on investment for taking action. Numerous studies show how investments in
reducing climate change produce near-term health co-benefits from reduced air pollution, offsetting a substantial

56

fraction of mitigation costs. So as we reduce greenhouse gases, we improve health and dramatically lower
health care costs.
The Task Force developed these eight criteria by which we would evaluate policy design and implementation
options for carbon emission limits and market mechanisms. I have added our priority, looking at these criteria
from a public health lens, in the right hand column.
Topic Number
(not indicative Evaluation Framework Topics
of priority)
1

Reach WA’s emissions reduction limits with high confidence and
consideration of WA’s emissions and energy sources

2

Establish a carbon price signal sufficient to stimulate a shift in investment
patterns

3

Minimize the implementation costs and competitiveness impacts to our
businesses and industries (flexibility)

4

Maximize the economic development benefits and opportunities for job growth
in WA

5

Minimize cost impacts to consumers and protect low-income communities from
increased energy costs

6

Reduce the public health risks associated with carbon pollution,
especially for vulnerable populations

7

Allow for effective administration (oversight, regulation, monitoring, evaluation,
and adjustment) of the program and markets created or affected by it

8

Influence and catalyze national and international action

Public Health
Lens/Priority
#2

#1

#3

Not unexpectedly, we suggest that Topic Number 6, “Reduce the public health risks associated with carbon
pollution, especially for vulnerable populations,” is the highest priority around which a market mechanism should
be selected, and that Topic Number 1, “Reach WA’s emissions reduction limits with high confidence and
consideration of WA’s emissions and energy sources” is the next most critical criteria. Topic Number 8,
“Influence and catalyze national and international action,” is the next highest priority inasmuch as Washington
alone cannot combat the effects of climate change, and we share a collective responsibility to protect the public
… everywhere.
Washington policy makers have an opportunity and a choice. The opportunity is to be a leader in demonstrating
the need for comprehensive action, and joining other states and regions already working to stem the impacts of
a warmer climate.
The choice is for both political parties and the executive and legislative branches to work together for the health
of all Washingtonians, because the worst climate change scenarios may be avoidable with aggressive policy
measures. The only stumbling block, and this would be unthinkable, is if our state has insufficient political will.
Our elected officials must take action for the health of our state and to spur other jurisdictions to do the same.
Those same officials can feel confident that the public will support this action. Our citizens are savvy, and they
understand this is not a choice of a healthy planet or a healthy economy; they know we can have both and,
indeed, that many climate strategies both reduce costs that can pay for mitigation, as well as spur innovation
that creates jobs.
I look forward to the governor and legislature taking near-term action to protect our health and our future.

Forestry’s Role in Carbon Reduction:
Recommendations from Forest Products Industry
To Carbon Emissions Reduction Task Force

Washington State’s abundant forests are a unique and considerable resource in combating climate change. In
fact, the Washington Department of Ecology reports that each year, Washington’s forests absorb 28% of the
state’s total carbon emissions1. Supporting our state’s forest products industry represents the best possible
outcome for reduction of carbon emissions.
Over ½ of Washington’s total land area is forested; approximately 47 percent of that total, or 10 million acres,
is considered working forest while the other 53 percent is preserved due to various policies at local, state and
federal levels, or due to practical matters. Nearly 90 percent of the annual timber harvest in Washington State
comes off state and private lands, which are managed under a federal Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) known
widely as the Forests & Fish Law. Several individual companies have their own Habitat Conservation Plans as
well. These HCPs represent some of the toughest forest practices laws and rules in the world, protecting clean
water, fish and wildlife and soils. At the same time, harvest and regeneration cycles ensure carbon storage
both in forest growth and in forest products.
Recommendation #1: Protect and Promote Washington’s Forest Products Industry
Working forests in Washington State are a contributor to carbon reduction. Therefore, all segments of the
forest products industry should be protected in order to maintain a viable industry throughout the state.
Existing statutes recognize the need to protect and promote working forests in our state








Provide incentives for maintaining working forests, such as expanding Transfer of Development Rights
programs and creating a Forest Legacy-type program in Washington to purchase development rights
on working forests. Incentives should be developed to maintain working forests, as required by law in
RCW 76.09.010.
Protect against disincentives such as changes in tax status and regulatory takings.
Current government ecosystem services programs; such as the Rivers and Habitat Open Space
Program, the Forestry Riparian Easement Program and the Family Forest Fish Passage Program, are
grossly underfunded. The state’s commitment to funding these programs should be fulfilled, and while
the industry is interested in other ecosystem services programs, priority should be placed on funding
these programs before creating new ones.
Maintain sawmill infrastructure.
Maintain the pulp and paper infrastructure. Protect against leakage of pollution and jobs, as required
by RCW 70.235.005; the majority of fuel used by Washington’s pulp and paper facilities is biomass,
which is carbon neutral. The world’s demand for paper products will continue to increase. If these
facilities move out of Washington, they may well burn coal instead of biomass. Use Washington’s high
environmental standards as a reason to keep pulp and paper in the state rather than forcing facilities
offshore.

Governor Inslee could position himself as a promoter of wood products as a green building material and
encourage innovative uses of wood products and increasing markets for Washington wood products by issuing

58

an executive order, similar to Governor Kitzhaber’s Executive Order 12-162, and the Obama administration’s
support 3 for innovative, sustainable wood building materials to protect the environment and create jobs.
National Forest Products Week is traditionally celebrated the third week in October and was signed into law in
1960. In September 2014, Governor Kitzhaber proclaimed October 19-26 as the first-ever Oregon Forest
Products Week, setting Oregon up as the nation’s leader in lumber production, and a world leader in using
innovation and advanced technology in all facets of forest management, research and production. Washington
is the second only behind Oregon in lumber production. We should be leading the world in innovation and
technology for forest management, research and production.
Recommendation #2: Protect Biomass Carbon Neutrality
The use of biomass to create energy is deemed carbon-neutral in state law (RCW 70.235.020(3)). Trees grow
through solar power and soak up carbon dioxide as they grow. Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases
stored in plants and trees are released to the atmosphere through decomposition, wildfires, prescribed fires, or
the burning of logging debris. Using forest bioenergy simply captures the energy potential of the carbon
dioxide as it moves through the natural carbon cycle.
 Preserve this carbon neutrality.
 Champion this position at regional and federal levels.
Recommendation #3: Advocate for Wood Construction to Store Carbon
Wood frame construction provides two important advantages toward reduction of carbon in the atmosphere:
Wood stores carbon for the life of the project, and embodied energy costs are lower in manufacturing wood
products, thereby saving energy. Yet in Washington State, barriers exist to expanding the use of Washington
wood in buildings.
 Advocate for building code changes to expand the use of cross laminated timber and other wood
products in multi-story buildings. In Europe and Canada, multi-story wood frame structures have
received acclaim, yet current building codes here in Washington limit the height of wood buildings.
Cross laminated timber is a practical answer to these code restrictions; Washington should act
decisively and creatively to remove code barriers. Governor Kitzhaber has become a market advocate
for Oregon wood, British Columbia too is a leader in support of wood building practices; the forest
products industry asks that Washington State’s leaders advocate for increased manufacturing and use
of technologically advanced wood products for their role in storing carbon.
 Empower the Technical Advisory Group of the State Building Code Council with a mission to assess and
recommend code changes to ensure best practices for carbon reduction in buildings, rather than
relying on current certification schemes with their inherent bias against Washington wood.
Recommendation #4: Implement Forest Health Treatments
Catastrophic wildfire poses a considerable threat in terms of carbon emissions here in Washington State. Since
1990, CO2 emissions from wildland forest fires in the lower 48 United States have averaged about 67 million
tons per year.4 Forest management treatments, particularly on federal lands, can reduce fuel loads and
increase disease resistance.



Governor Inslee could position himself as a protector against carbon pollution by joining with Governor
Kitzhaber in providing substantial incentives for forest health treatments on (particularly federal) forest
lands. Incremental harvest on these lands would serve the dual purpose of protecting mill
infrastructure as stated above. The 2008 Climate Action Team Forest Sector Workgroup recognized
this need and suggested additional exploration. Some capital funding has been provided; building on
this foundation, with the cooperation of stakeholder groups such as the Northeast Forestry Coalition,
can make substantial strides in reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire.
We applaud Governor Inslee’s request to the US Secretary of Agriculture to designate 720,000 acres of
federal land in Washington to allow for expedited and prioritized forest health treatments and
restoration efforts. Continued follow-through to ensure this restoration is completed to request a
specific designation would further signal his interest in mitigating this potential carbon pollution
source.

Response to carbon pricing proposals:
Governor Inslee issued EO 14-04 and created the CERT to provide advice and recommendations to inform the
Governor’s 2015 carbon emissions reduction legislative proposal in order to achieve the intent of RCW 70.235.
The intent statement in RCW 70.235.005 is clear that the state will, in addition to meeting the limits
established in RCW 70.235.020, minimize the potential to export pollution, jobs, and economic opportunities,
and reduce emissions at the lowest cost to Washington’s economy, consumers and businesses. The CERT has
heard from British Columbia on a carbon tax, and California on their cap and trade program, but we do not yet
have enough information to provide advice and recommendations to the Governor for his 2015 legislative
proposal on how Washington can achieve its long-term greenhouse gas emission reductions that will ensure
pollution, jobs and economic opportunities are not leaked to other states or countries, and what measures
should be taken that will be at the lowest cost to Washington’s economy. There are many questions yet
unanswered, but Washington’s businesses are clear that we want to work collaboratively with the government
to protect our environment and economy for future generations.
Cap and Trade
From the timber industry’s perspective, linkage to the California cap and trade market-based mechanism would
have significant drawbacks for Washington’s forest industry. California does not have a pulp and paper sector.
Washington forest landowners rely on our pulp and paper sector to help maintain the economic viability of our
forest lands. The timber industry is Washington’s third largest manufacturing sector, with an exemplary
regulatory structure. If our wood products manufacturing facilities are regulated under a cap, there is an
extremely high risk that those facilities, many of which are owned and operated by international companies,
would relocate to other states and nations with lower environmental and labor regulatory standards. In
addition, the majority of the fuel used in Washington’s facilities is biomass. If those facilities leave the state,
they may well be rebuilt in an area that uses coal for energy.
Quantifying and capturing the benefits of forest offsets remains a contentious issue in the California Cap and
Trade program. Using the California model would likely import the same divisive arguments to Washington
and impact the very sector that is both a significant economic driver and an important asset in reducing carbon
emissions in this state.

60



The Department of Ecology, in its 2008 “Comparison of the impacts of forest practices on carbon
storage in Washington, Oregon, California and British Columbia” acknowledges the issues with
Washington’s competitive position. Use this report to level the playing field.

Carbon Tax/Alternative fuels
Business interests in Washington State have advocated for a transportation package which essentially taxes
carbon, using revenues to fund preservation, maintenance and completion of major corridor projects already
underway. The forest products industry remains committed to this goal.
It should be recognized that a carbon tax disproportionately affects rural areas, which tend to travel farther for
work, shopping and other services, and tend not to have critical mass to make transit schemes effective. Many
forest products businesses have been established for generations as the economic heart of rural communities
throughout the state.
If Washington adopts a tax approach, we must:



Ensure farm equipment (and other off-road diesel use, already included by statutory definition) is
exempt.
Ensure that an equitable share of the tax is dedicated to maintaining and improving the transportation
infrastructure in Washington State, reducing emissions caused by wait times.

A low carbon fuel standard is an attractive option for some business sectors. While not covered in the CERT
process, shifting to lower carbon in transportation fuels does focus on the transportation sector, which targets
the area of most concern here in Washington:





Focus on fuels currently available.
Providing research funding for new alternatives, including forest-derived biomass.
Phase in alternative fuel standards on a timeline that recognizes the considerable cost to business.
Provide incentives to shift vehicle fleets to alternative fuels, recognizing that fleet shifts can offer
significant carbon reduction yet can negatively impact transportation-dependent industries.

61

Combined Recommendations for the
Washington Carbon Emissions Reduction Task Force
and Joint Select Task Force on Nuclear Energy
from the Energy Northwest Executive Board
(October 2014)

BACKGROUND
Energy Northwest
The Washington Public Utility Districts Association prompted establishment of Energy
Northwest in 1957 to aggregate the collective needs and resources of public power, and,
through cooperative action, to build and operate electrical generating facilities.
Today Energy Northwest operates five clean generating sources – nuclear, wind, hydro and
solar – that produce more than 1,300 megawatts of power, including the Northwest’s only
nuclear power plant. These projects provide enough reliable, affordable and environmentally
responsible energy to power more than a million homes annually – or a city the size of
Seattle – and that carbon-free electricity is provided at the cost of generation.
As a state joint operating agency, Energy Northwest comprises 27 public power member
utilities that serve more than 1.5 million Washington ratepayers. The agency continually
explores new generation projects to meet its members’ needs.
Current Nuclear & Gas Generation
The electricity annually generated by Columbia Generating Station represents nearly five
percent of the state’s electric utility fuel mix, and annually prevents about 4.4 million metric
tons of CO2 from entering our atmosphere. The facility is also recognized by the region’s
Public Power Council, among others, as the best economic value for the Northwest
compared to the next best possible replacement option – combined-cycle natural gas.
Some Energy Northwest member utilities operate or take power (approximately 370 MWs
total) from two combined-cycle natural gas-fired plants. Currently providing affordable
power – like Columbia – but with half the carbon emissions of coal generation. Natural gas
accounts for 11 percent of the state’s electric utility fuel mix.
DISCUSSION
Carbon Pricing & Future Generation Options
Given the significant contribution by currently operating natural gas plants to the state’s
energy mix, carbon pricing will result in a cost impact to some electric ratepayers. As such,
the Energy Northwest Executive Board believes a diverse mix of low-carbon and carbon-

62

free generation – an “all-of-the-above” approach – will satisfy the complex economic and
social pressures that will continue to shape our state’s energy infrastructure.
Regional energy demand is growing very slowly in Washington – a result of lagging
industrial growth and efficiencies gained through energy conservation – and will likely stay
that way for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, Washington enjoys among the lowest
electric rates in the nation, in great part due to low-cost, clean hydro generation, which
provides 70 percent of Washington’s baseload electricity, followed by low-cost natural gas
and low-cost, clean nuclear.
However, hydro is built out close to capacity, and intermittent wind and solar sources do not
provide required baseload generation. Although Energy Northwest is a regional leader in
demand response and energy storage development, these innovations are still in their
infancy, and in the near term will not provide the efficiencies and storage necessary to
satisfy the eventual baseload power requirements of significant regional growth.
When energy demand increases in the Northwest, the only likely available baseload
development options will be natural gas and nuclear. The Energy Northwest Executive
Board believes these generating sources should be evaluated based upon their proven
capability to meet carbon emission performance goals consistently, reliably and costeffectively.
Nuclear Value Studies
Economically, both natural gas and nuclear are uniquely attractive – natural gas has low
up-front costs, while nuclear, which requires significant up-front investment, is considered
by leading economists to be the best long-term value.
Environmentally, natural gas lifecycle emissions are about half those of coal (approximately
620 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per gigawatt hour). Nuclear lifecycle emissions (17
tons per gigawatt hour), on the other hand, are less than hydro, and considered second
only to hydro (and not by much) in reducing global emissions to date.
All credible analyses of carbon reduction – by the Energy Information Administration and
independent international institutions like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,
the International Energy Agency, and even the Environmental Protection Agency –
demonstrate unequivocally that the United States and world cannot achieve meaningful
reductions in carbon emissions without preservation of our existing nuclear energy assets
and large-scale construction of new nuclear power plants.
Energy Department Secretary Ernest Moniz recently underscored those results by stating
“nuclear energy, as an important low-carbon energy source, must play a major part in
meeting the most pressing challenge of climate change.”

63

Small Modular Reactor Team
Energy Northwest is currently working with NuScale Power and Utah Associated Municipal
Power Systems to meet that challenge; Energy Northwest has first right of offer to operate
a small, multi-modular reactor facility in southeastern Idaho. The facility will be developed
by NuScale and owned by UAMPS. Federal funding and project momentum have helped
move the original 2025 operational target date forward to end-of-year 2023.
When energy demand increases in Washington, Energy Northwest’s experience with the
Idaho project will position us to bring this technology to Washington and the Tri-Cities.
Clean, Reliable & Cost-Effective Nuclear Power
Massive Amounts of Electricity
Each fission, or splitting of an atom, provides nearly one hundred million (100,000,000)
times as much energy as the “burning” of one carbon atom in a fossil fuel; one uranium
pellet is equivalent to the energy provided by 149 gallons of oil, 1,780 pounds of coal, or
17 million British thermal units of natural gas.
The electricity annually generated by Columbia Generating Station alone represents nearly
five percent of the state’s electric utility fuel mix, nearly 10 percent of the electricity
generated within the state, and more than 12 percent of the Bonneville Power
Administration’s firm energy (12-month annual average).
Cost Effective
Columbia is recognized by the Bonneville Power Administration and the region’s Public
Power Council as the best economic value for the Northwest compared to the next best
possible replacement option – combined-cycle natural gas.
The agency’s most recent fuel purchase – well below other market options and
predictable through 2028 – is now showing tens of millions of dollars in current rate case
savings, and will generate tens of millions more through 2028.
Reliable
During fiscal 2014, Columbia sent more than 9.7 million megawatt hours of electricity to the
grid – a station generation record.
The plant’s average availability for 2012 through 2014 – which includes a refueling outage
year – is 95 percent; fiscal year 2014 alone was 100 percent.
Columbia has been on line for nearly five years without an unplanned shutdown.
Clean: Columbia annually prevents about 4.4 million metric tons of CO2 from entering our
atmosphere.

EXECUTIVE BOARD POSITION STATEMENT
In order to satisfy economic and social demands upon the energy sector, the Energy
Northwest Executive Board believes regional future energy resources must represent a
diverse mix of low-cost and clean energy sources, of which nuclear – including the potential
of small modular reactors – is a key component.

RECOMMENDATIONS
Regarding carbon policy and the potential for new nuclear development
The executive board of Energy Northwest recommends that the state implement the
following energy policy principles to help guide legislative discussions on Washington state
energy policy:
Promote legislative energy strategies that are performance-based and
technology neutral.
Do not compromise the reliability of the electric grid.
Protect the current mix of low-cost generation to enable rate case stability.
Support existing baseload generation provided by clean hydro and clean nuclear, as well as
natural gas, to balance wind, solar and other clean electricity technologies already
supported by the state.
Promote the development of new low-cost and low- or non-carbon emitting resource
solutions as needed to meet load demand.
Recognize that hydro and nuclear generation are part of the nation’s clean energy
mix, and take action to promote their development.
Recognize that power generation within the state is nearly carbon free.
Recognize that Washington carbon is produced primarily from transportation, not energy,
and that electrifying the transportation sector is part of the carbon solution.
Consider any proposed new carbon emission policies within the context of existing
state and federal policies (such as the Washington Energy Independence Act).

65

Regarding the potential for new nuclear development
The executive board of Energy Northwest recommends that the state consider
legislation to support the potential development of new nuclear energy facilities in
Washington. Such legislation may, among other initiatives:
Encourage the development and use of clean energy resources by modifying
Washington statutory language to support a clean energy standard, including nuclear
generation, in place of a renewable energy standard (Example: South Carolina’s
comprehensive energy plan).
Educate Washington citizens about a diverse future energy mix by establishing, through
legislation, that the planning and development of new nuclear generation facilities may be in
the public interest. Such a position by the state would help facilitate:
Washington state leadership in technological and industrial innovation
State influence upon national nuclear energy policy and dialogue (Example: Virginia
legislature established the Virginia Nuclear Energy Consortium for one such a purpose)
Economic development and significant jobs creation in the state
Encourage legislative committees to address K-12 and college curriculum changes
that would include studies on nuclear energy in science programs.

The Honorable Governor Jay Inslee State of Washington
P.O. Box 40002
Olympia, WA 98504-0002

RE:

Draft Comments to Governor Inslee concerning CERT

Dear Governor Inslee:
Thank you for the opportunity to be part of the Carbon Emissions Reduction Task Force (CERT). Your
regard for the environment of the Northwest and your concern regarding climate change, even in the
face of criticism from those who do not seem to quite comprehend the scope of the challenge, is
commendable.
You established this Task Force to advise you on a market-based greenhouse gas emission program that
will allow Washington to meet statutory greenhouse gas emission limits in the most effective way while
minimizing costs, supporting the economy, and promoting fairness. You asked Task Force members to
consider the "best interests of the current and future citizens of the state" and to promote equity,
accountability, and competitiveness in the transition away from carbon-based fuels. Another critical
consideration, of course, is that the state must comply with the terms of treaties between the United
States and the tribal governments in the State of Washington, as well as all associated case law and the
co-management responsibilities.
As you know, I agreed to participate on the Task Force in an advisory capacity only. It is important for
me to underscore that fact because Tribes are co-managers of natural resources with the state and
federal governments and, as such, implementation of any state actions which impact tribal treaty rights
and resources must first undergo a government-to-government process with federally recognized treaty
Indian Tribes, and there must be agreement at that policy level.
It could be that Tribes will request a meeting with you to discuss this issue prior to the passage of your
2015 carbon emission legislation, in the spirit of the Centennial Accord and co- management. That
remains to be seen.

67

That being said, the Tribes have been concerned about climate change issues for many years, and
we have been strongly engaged in the effort to respond to the challenge. I'm sure you have found
Tribes to be supportive of your efforts in this regard, and that they are typically anxious to push
harder and do more. This shouldn't come as any surprise, because we are so directly connected
with the land, water and natural resources of the Northwest. We are affected by climate change
every day. We are first in line to feel its impact, and we know full well that greenhouse gas
emissions are a major challenge.
So what is to be done? Discussion by the Task Force bounced back and forth between a carbon
tax, a cap and trade program and a hybrid of the two. I have comments on all three of these
options.
Carbon Tax
In CERT discussions, the need for stability and simplicity in any mechanism was emphasized. The
carbon tax offers simplicity because it can be implemented through existing fuel tax structures that
are already in place. It is also more easily constructed to be government revenue neutral by
reducing other taxes or through rebates . A number of Task Force members suggested that a
carbon tax, or price-based approach, could provide more price certainty for businesses and
consumers because the tax rate placed on a unit of carbon emissions is set and gradually ramped
up in pre-determined amounts. In this context, CERT members provided the following specific
observations that a price based approach:
1. Could provide more cost effective emissions reductions and aid long-term business
decision making;
2. Makes setting a price on carbon more transparent than an emissions-based system;
and
3. Appears to provide a more targeted means to reduce emissions from the
transportation sector because it can provide a clear price signal at the pump.
The carbon tax is easier to administer for a broad range of emission sources, especially
transportation fuels. It has always been clear that particular attention needs to be given to the
transportation sector as the largest source of carbon emissions in Washington. With a price on
carbon, the cost of transportation fuel will increase. Complimentary policies, along with targeted
use of revenues from the tax, can encourage innovation and investment in the long-term supply
and delivery of cost competitive low carbon alternative energy sources and public transit.
Overall, a policy design going forward needs to consider an integrated approach which considers
such items as land-use policies, transit oriented development, and alternatives to current single
occupancy vehicles. This includes adequate mass transit, zero emissions vehicles, and alternative
fuel infrastructure.
These are all points well made in the CERT report to the Governor's Office. I do wish to add some
emphasis here. There are many transportation-related laws and regulations in this state that truly
do require updating, such as substantially increased incentives for the purchase and use of hybrid
and electric as well as other ultra-low and zero emission vehicles, the expanded use of HOV lanes,
increased incentives for carpooling and use of transit, increased investments in transit and
improved road, rail and ferry infrastructure, etc. This is our number one problem area, so this state
should surge forward and set the pace with solutions.

68

Countries, states and provinces that have introduced a carbon tax to cut greenhouse-gas emissions
have mostly found that the policy works, and that jobs and incomes don't suffer. In fact, the
opposite is often true. The prospect of a carbon tax almost always gives rise to political
resistance. We could certainly expect that to be the case in Washington. Yet, in many countries,
carbon taxes have not only resulted in reduced emissions, carbon taxes have ended up reducing
other taxes by more than they collect. When operated well, they boost economies and result in
increased employment. That was the case in the United Kingdom and in British Columbia, for
example. That impact hasn't been universal, but it has largely been the case. It can be a regressive
tax, however-an impact that can and must be safeguarded against with measures to reimburse
or reduce taxes for low-income populations. Also, it is important to remember that tribal
sovereignty can come into play with any form of taxation, and thus structures such as the existing
tribal fuel tax agreements must be put into place.
Cap and Trade
There are also advantages to cap and trade, or an emissions-based approach. The cap is set
scientifically and businesses that have an easy time meeting the cap will have extra allowances to
sell to heavier polluters. This serves as an economic encouragement to reduce emissions. The cap
and trade system allows for the setting of specific limits to emissions, but can have high
uncertainty and volatility in the costs. This uncertainty can dampen incentives for businesses to
invest in alternatives to carbon-intensive practices. The potential for price volatility within a cap
and trade system was a consistent concern raised by certain CERT members.
Of course, the cap must be set at an appropriate level, which is not a given in Washington State.
The Tribes' experience with the state's politically-based mishandling of the fish consumption
rate and acceptable cancer rate in setting water quality standards is an example that shakes the
confidence level. Furthermore, the necessary complexity of a cap and trade structure, including
the use of offsets, makes this system more susceptible to loopholes and lobbying pressure that
can reduce how effective it is in changing behavior. Offsets can also adversely affect vulnerable
communities, exacerbating issues around environmental justice.
Although administrative cost and effort depends on how the program is designed, in general a cap
and trade program would require more administration to monitor emissions, create a registry of
permits, and keep track of trades and ownership of allowances. Although administrative costs can
be reduced by linking to existing programs, such as those in California and Quebec, that could
shift emission reduction out of the state and prevent us from meeting the statutory requirement. In
addition, linking to an existing program could make for a less efficient system that does not take
into account Washington's specific and unique circumstances.
Hybrid
Both the carbon tax and the cap and trade approach have strengths and weaknesses. There could
be some advantages to forming a hybrid system. The hybrid system places a cap on the quantity of
emissions while allowing adjustments to the maximum and/or minimum price for the permits. In
another type of hybrid, there is a minimum tax to purchase a permit and a higher tax on emissions
not covered by the permit. Both approaches would likely have to be applied across the board. It
would be an administrative nightmare, it seems, for the state to tax some energy users

69

and not others while also tracking cap and trade levels. By having a cost ceiling and/or floor, a
hybrid system addresses the volatility of carbon costs while still having the benefit of a set
emission limit. However, enforcing the price limits in a hybrid system can lead to less incentive
for reducing emissions and lower environmental performance. Also price controls of this nature
have not been widely tested in practice.
Options for Use of Revenue
The revenue generated from either a price based or emission based system should be used to
offset costs to consumers and businesses and to help energy-intensive industries transition from
carbon-based energy sources. Relief for low-income households and vulnerable sectors of the
economy would promote equity and stimulate economic vitality. A carbon tax would also have
better political momentum if the revenues were used for tax reductions that clearly resulted in
neutral government growth.
The advantage of any market-based approach is that it creates incentives for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions while allowing businesses and consumers to choose how they do so. In keeping with
this, revenues could be used to spur innovation and investment in climate-friendly solutions. Job
growth and economic benefits would result from investment in energy efficiency, green
infrastructure, and modernizing our transportation system to reflect our transition away from
carbon-intensive fuels. These measures would intersect with issues of environmental justice as
vulnerable communities would have increased access to carbon-free energy alternatives, energy
efficiency programs, and training for green jobs.
Revenues should also be applied to developing actions to improve the resilience of communities
and natural resources to the impacts of climate change. Protection and restoration of forests,
wetlands, and estuaries promotes carbon sequestration and serve the public interest in multiple
ways. Healthy ecosystem function can protect the citizens of Washington from the adverse effects
of climate change, so any adaptation actions must not be at the expense of environmental quality
or tribal treaty rights. In a recent article in The Olympian, you were reported to have said that
"raising revenue through a cap and trade carbon emissions program may be one way to pay for
flood reduction projects." The comment was made in the context of your recent visit to the
Chehalis River watershed and the article purported that an agreement on a "flood fix" there is
near, including the possibility of a dam. It is imperative that you understand the treaties and the
principles of the government-to-government process, and your comment is a case in point. The
Quinault Nation is the Tribe with treaty-protected rights on the Chehalis River. We oppose the
construction of a dam there, and we have made our position very clear to you. Whether the issue
is a dam or carbon emissions, the government-to-government relationship must be fully
considered, from both the perspective of the Tribes as well as the state.
Conclusion
Ultimately, the specific design of any approach will strongly determine the performance, both
economically and environmentally. All things considered, it does seem that implementation of a
carbon tax system would be the most logical course of action, if endorsed by tribal governments
and if appropriate tax agreements with Tribes are agreed upon. The carbon tax could be gradually
eased into place, resulting in reduced emissions across a variety of sectors, including
transportation. Yes, this would mean paying some more at the pump for the average consumer.

70

And yes, it would require some education for the public and the legislature. But, with sufficient
education, and with the possibility of reduced taxes in other areas, similar to the program in British
Columbia and in other countries, people would experience a substantial economic and environmental
benefit. With proper management, those benefits would compound over time. As stated, British
Columbia is a great example of this. There, the government has substantially reduced its income tax
rate, decreased its corporate taxes, and offers rebates to low-income families using revenues from the
carbon tax. It now has the lowest personal income tax rate in Canada and one of the lowest corporate
rates in North America. At the same time, the carbon tax has been extraordinarily effective in tackling
the root cause of carbon pollution: the burning of fossil fuels. Since the tax came in, fuel use in B.C.
has dropped by 16 per cent. In the rest of Canada, it's risen by three per cent (counting all fuels
covered by the tax). To put that accomplishment in perspective, Canada's Kyoto target was a six-percent reduction in 20 years. The evidence points to the carbon tax as the major driver of these gains.
The B.C. carbon tax has gradually increased since it was instituted in 2008, and today the carbon tax
of $30 (Canadian) per metric ton of carbon equates to 30 cents per gallon of gasoline at the pump (23
cents in U.S. dollars).
The CERT Task Force also discussed the prospect of "binding" or joining with other states and British
Columbia in the effort to reduce carbon emissions. I see no problem with this, as long as it can be done
with administrative efficiency and as long as Tribes and First Nations support it. Carbon emissions and
other causes of climate change do not recognize borders.
A robust and visionary approach is needed to meet the 2008 statutory emission limits and to protect
Washington from the worst impacts of climate change. Concerns about reduced competitiveness are
valid, but it should be noted that many countries, states, and provinces around the world are instituting
greenhouse gas emission policies already. The GLOBE Climate Legislation Study, a collaboration
between Globe International and the London School of Economics, found that of the 66 countries that
are responsible for 88 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, 61 have passed laws to promote
domestic sources of clean energy, 54 have legislated to increase energy efficiency, and 52 have
policies to improve their resilience to the impacts of climate change. Washington is poised to take a
leadership role in devising a practical and efficient program that will benefit residents for generations
to come.
Again, I do appreciate being appointed to the CERT Task Force. I look forward to helping you work
toward improved relations with the Tribes in Washington in the months and years to come.

MEMORANDUM
To:

Governor Jay Inslee, Chris Davis, Keith Phillips, the Carbon Emissions Reduction
Taskforce
From:
Rich Stolz, Executive Director, OneAmerica
Re:
Comments on the CERT Report
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Washington State’s strategy to address climate change through a carbon price must be guided by racial
equity, deliver net-environmental and economic benefits to people of color and communities with lower
incomes, and ensure accountability and transparency. Below I have included a set of principles for
climate justice prepared by communities of color across Washington.
I also wish to stress that Washington State’s carbon price must generate revenue that will be spent on
measures that have a strong nexus to the goals of carbon emissions reduction, climate change
mitigation or adaptation, and that mitigate the impact of costs to low-income consumers. Through the
CERT process, we have learned from the experiences in other jurisdictions that reducing carbon
pollution depends on making low-carbon alternatives affordable and accessible for all residents, and
that without strong efforts to reduce the financial burden to low-income consumers, carbon pricing
systems can be regressive. There will be strong temptation to spend carbon price revenue on programs
or projects that may have little relationship to the goals of a carbon price policy. We urge that such
deals be viewed with great skepticism, and that whatever may emerge be held to high standards
consistent with the priorities listed above and in the CERT report with regard to the framework for
outcomes.

Principles for Climate Justice
Climate change poses one of the greatest threats to social, economic, and racial equity here in
Washington State and across the world. Our jobs, health, and communities where we live are
threatened by the consequences of climate change and without bold interventions, we can expect
more severe heat-waves, flooding, exposure to air pollutants and allergens, extreme weather
events, food scarcity, and increased spread of disease. Our communities are not starting on an even
footing since environmental and health outcomes are already negatively and disproportionately
impacting our communities. These conditions will have the most direct impact on communities
with lower incomes, indigenous people, and people of color. We are united by a deeply felt urgency
to take immediate action to reduce carbon emissions in ways that address social, economic, health,
and food justice.
Time and time again opponents of workers’ rights, environmental protection, economic justice and
public health have successfully pitted workers, environmentalists, people of color, and other
communities against each other. We, as organizations and community leaders committed to racial,
environmental, and economic justice call for a climate change policy that cuts carbon emission and
addresses poverty, invests in disadvantaged communities, creates good clean energy jobs, and
improves both air quality and public health.
We are collectively committed to achieving climate justice through the following principles:

72

Racial equity must be at the center of policies that address climate change.



Policy choices and implementation approaches must be informed by and responsive to
racial, environmental, and economic analysis.
Communities most impacted1 by climate change must be fully engaged in policy design and
implementation to ensure equitable outcomes.

People of color and communities with lower incomes must receive netenvironmental and economic benefits.




Environmental Benefits: The policy should ensure the reduction of carbon emissions.
Reducing emissions now will lessen the problem of climate change, and therefore the
burdens of adaptation, later on. Climate change is a public health issue that
disproportionately impacts people of color and communities with lower incomes. The
policy’s environmental outcomes must therefore prioritize improvements to public health,
especially through the equitable distribution of better air quality. Achieving this goal
requires that Washington identify environmental justice “hotspots,” or areas with high
exposure to pollution and related social instability. This information should be publicly
accessible, inform efforts impact climate change, and address existing disparities.
Economic benefits: Revenue raised through any program should be used on strategies with
a strong nexus with policies and programs that address climate change, and should be
invested directly in lower-income communities, indigenous communities and communities
of color so that the economic benefits outweigh the policy’s economic burdens. Reinvested
revenue should work to accomplish the following:
1. The highest priority for reinvestment must be to mitigate financial costs of
implementation to communities with lower incomes.
2. Further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.
3. Create clean, living wage jobs that open pathways for people with lower-incomes,
people of color, and local residents to enter the green industry workforce.
4. Enable people to live where they work with access to clean transportation, an
affordable place to live, and clean and secure food sources.

Ensure accountability and transparency through public, accessible, and
culturally appropriate participation and strong enforcement


Effective engagement with lower-income communities, indigenous communities, and
people of color in both policy design and implementation will help ensure equitable
outcomes. A successful policy will require the state agencies responsible for its
implementation to monitor its impacts on climate change indicators on an ongoing basis,
and to make this information publicly available.

These Principles were adopted on October 17, 2014 by: Asian Pacific Islander Coalition, El Centro de la Raza,
Climate Solutions, Community to Community, Got Green?, the Latino Community Fund, OneAmerica, Puget
Sound Sage, and Washington CAN!
1 We define the communities most impacted by climate change as the following communities: people of color, people with lower incomes,

indigenous communities, and farm workers.

73

In addition to these principles, please find below further thoughts on program and policy design.

Use racial and economic equity analyses to inform policy design:
Designing a carbon price that fits Washington State’s unique demographic, emissions, and
environmental profiles will require thorough consideration of each in this context. As the CERT process
revealed, there are still too many gaps in data to make an informed decision about policy options.
Specifically, further research must focus on:



Economic modeling on the implications of a carbon price for incomes broken down by quintile;
net-income is not a useful metric in quantifying the anticipated economic gains and losses.
A database of environmental justice (EJ) “hotspots” like California’s CalEnviroScreen (see
Michael Gibbs’ presentation to the CERT on June 24th) and use this information to identify areas
of greatest need for revenue expenditures. EPA will soon release a similar tool, EJSCREEN, and
the Governor’s policy staff should be trained to use this free resource. This tool will give badlyneeded data around environmental health indicators, which could all improve dramatically if the
carbon price is well-designed.

Dedicate a portion of the revenue to impacted communities:
The aforementioned “hotspot” data and income quintile analysis will guide efforts to use revenue to
first benefit communities most negatively impacted by both climate change and the economic burdens
of carbon pricing. California sets aside 25% of carbon revenues to benefit EJ hotspot communities and
directly invests 10% in projects located within those communities. Washington should adopt a similar
policy but could do better by designating more of the revenue to benefit our own hotspot communities.
The following projects and show how Washington can spend a portion of its revenue to create jobs,
improve air quality, upgrade infrastructure for resiliency, mitigate the policy’s financial burden to lowincome Washingtonians, and further reduce carbon emissions in our own hotspot communities, as
identified by EPA’s EJSCREEN.
1. Mitigate costs of compliance to low-income consumers
This policy must make compliance affordable, especially to those consumers who already spend a large
proportion of their income on commodities and services whose prices will rise as a result. Washington
should therefore use a significant portion of carbon revenues to provide direct cash rebates to lowerand moderate-income families. Direct cash rebates would provide the flexibility necessary for all families
to adapt to the policy. Options for providing direct cash rebates to disadvantaged communities include:
 Funding and increasing the Working Families Tax Rebate. Based on the federal Earned Income
Tax Credit (EITC), the Working Families Tax Rebate (WFTR) would provide more than 400,000
lower-income Washingtonians with new resources to help them address rising fuel and energy
prices. The WFTR was enacted in 2008, but has yet to be implemented. To improve its
effectiveness policymakers should consider funding it at a higher level – up to 50 percent of the
EITC – and expanding eligibility for lower-income childless workers.
 Enacting a state Child Tax Credit: The Working Families Tax Rebate is a powerful economic tool
because it primarily benefits lower-income working families with children who benefit most
from additional income. However, policymakers should also find ways to provide direct cash
rebates to lower-income and middle-class families who are not eligible for the WFTR because
their incomes are too high or they cannot work due to a disability. Adopting a state version of
the federal Child Tax Credit would boost the impact of the WFTR and would extend rebates to
more Washington families.

74

2. Invest in public transportation and equitable transit-oriented development
Nearly half of all greenhouse gas emissions in Washington State come from transportation. Meeting
Washington’s statutory emission limits requires a serious overhaul to transportation so that low-carbon
alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles are affordable and accessible for all Washingtonians. The state
should expand existing public transit options, using revenue from the carbon price to fund these
projects. In order to adequately reduce emissions, however, transit projects must also be designed to
reduce urban sprawl and promote dense development through equitable transit-oriented development.
Both of these goals require specific attention to affordability so that low-income residents will not be
displaced by rising property values following innovations to transportation. Increasing Washington’s
stock of affordable housing and designing transit projects to serve these areas will allow people to live
where they work and reduce their reliance on fossil fuels.
Using carbon revenue to implement a low-income fare throughout the state will make this
service more accessible to all Washingtonians and incentivize higher participation among low-income
riders. Currently, those jurisdictions in which a majority of riders would qualify for such a fare reduction
cannot implement it for lack of funding, despite desperate need and high demand.
Fumes emitted through transportation also pose serious threats to public health for residents
near major highways, especially in the Puget Sound Region. Reducing on-road traffic and requiring clean
fuels for transit, school buses, and freight vehicles will have significant public health benefits for
populations who already suffer from disproportionate rates of asthma and other respiratory illnesses.
3. Create green jobs for local people
Washington must embrace the opportunity to create new jobs in the low-carbon and carbon-free
industries, and a portion of those jobs must go to local people. As research through Seattle’s Targeted
Local Hire initiative shows, hiring local people for construction and other projects significantly
diminishes carbon emitted through commuter traffic and bolsters local economies. Increasing our green
infrastructure must mean job opportunities for low-income communities and people of color that are
proportional to their representation in the state.
The technological innovations that reduction in carbon emissions will require of many industries
will require facilities to adopt new technologies. Revenue from the carbon price should also be set aside
to help such companies transition their existing workforces into these new roles and provide them with
necessary job training. This will keep rates of unemployment down and facilitate the transition for
businesses with high emissions. It will also prevent some of the forecasted leakage in trade-exposed
industries by making the transition to low-carbon technologies affordable in Washington.
4. Fund adaptation projects for communities threatened by climate disruption
The UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has found that climate disruption is now
inevitable and governments and communities must prepare for significant environmental changes.
Following Seattle Public Utilities’ lead, Washington State must commission a comprehensive study
forecasting to the extent possible the impacts of rising sea levels; ocean acidification; shifts in seasonal
precipitation; increases in temperatures and natural disasters; flooding, drought; and other effects of
climate disruption. This database should inform the state’s resiliency efforts, and a portion of the carbon
revenue should also directly fund adaptation projects in the communities identified by the EJ screening
tool that are also most vulnerable to climate disruption. Such adaptation measures could include:
improving residential water infrastructure to accommodate increases to stormwater; retrofit houses
and public buildings for energy efficiency; move houses threatened by rising sea levels away from the
water’s edge; supplement nutrition assistance programs (in anticipation of increased food prices).
5. Create a grant fund for low-carbon community-led projects
A portion of the revenue will be set aside for community-led initiatives to achieve energy independence,
improve local access to healthy food, create urban forestry projects, conserve water, etc. Inviting

75

communities to apply for funding will encourage them to take ownership over the low-carbon economy,
identify the best projects for their own communities, and could even spur local job growth if the grants
are large enough.

Create effective transparency, accountability, and oversight mechanisms
Without careful measures to limit compliance flexibility, carbon prices—particularly cap-and-trade
systems—give emitters too much opportunity to manipulate markets and avoid emission reductions.
The following options describe important measures to ensure a successful, fair policy in Washington.
Unless otherwise indicated, each option applies to any type of carbon price (a cap, a tax, or a
combination of the two).
1. Create an Environmental Equity Board
Washington must create an oversight board to work with state agencies to review the carbon price
before implementation. Membership will consist of representatives of highly impacted communities
from across Washington State, who will engage in a dialogue with the staff of state agencies involved in
policy implementation to anticipate and pre-empt the policy’s unintended, negative consequences for
their communities. This group will also advise state efforts to invest revenue in ways that will benefit
communities and contribute to emissions reductions. This board will convene to review the initial policy
plan and the appropriate state agency will solicit the board’s feedback. The board will continue to meet
on a regular basis to monitor the environmental and economic impacts of the carbon price, related
policies (including the Clean Fuels Standard and other aspects of the Executive Order), and other
environmental policies.
2. Do not allow offsets
If the Governor should propose a cap-and-trade system, his policy must exclude the option of offsets.
Any purchase of offsets decreases emission reductions within the state, thereby missing important
opportunities to improve public health. At best, even the strictest offset protocols are very difficult to
monitor. Proving any externality (a key component to offset protocols set forth by the Western Climate
Initiative) is difficult, and quantifying it is nearly impossible. It also requires that certain sectors be
exempt from the cap in order to serve as options for offsets, including agriculture. Other jurisdictions,
including California, have found that offsets in other countries have led to serious human rights abuses
by pushing indigenous populations off their land to increase forestry. If Washington is to approach
climate change mitigation with long-term goals in mind, any “short cuts” or loopholes like offsets allow
industries to procrastinate their commitment to carbon emission reductions.
3. Limit market manipulation
The CERT explored multiple ways to avoid market manipulation in a cap-and-trade system, specifically in
markets that auction off allowances. If Washington adopts such a system, the state must place limits on
stockpiling carbon allowances, build in an automatically escalating floor price, auction allowances only
to emitters, keep auctions public and transparent, and maintain a reserve of allowances for costcontainment. These measures will keep the cost of abatement low enough to guard against leakage for
all emitters, while simultaneously generating necessary revenue to adopt the low-carbon alternatives
Washington needs to meet its statutory emissions reduction goals.

President & Chief Executive Officer

Carbon Emissions Reduction Task Force
Co-Chair Rod Brown
Cascadia Law Group
Co-Chair Ada Healey
Vulcan

Dear Co-Chairs Brown and Healey:
I am pleased to have had the opportunity to serve on Governor lnslee's Carbon Emissions Reduction
Task Force ("CERT"), alongside very able individuals from a variety of sectors within the state. The
following comments are provided to further the consideration of this important topic.
We support the Governor's objective of reducing carbon pollution in the state of Washington and, more
specifically, meeting the statutory limits on carbon emissions enacted by the 2008 Washington
Legislature. Put simply, addressing the problem of climate change is the right thing to do for current and
future generations of our state, and we believe the business community should be a part of the solution
to that problem.
As to the CERT's very specific mission "to provide recommendations on the design and implementation of
a carbon emission limits and market mechanisms program for Washington," we do not endorse a market
mechanism program at this time. More specifically, we believe further analysis is needed to better define
and characterize the wide-ranging impacts and potential unintended consequences of an emissionsbased or price-based market mechanism approach. Further, from what we have learned thus far, if a cap
and trade system is implemented with a low carbon price, it will not significantly influence behavior (but
it will add administrative complexity and cost). If a cap and trade system is implemented with a high
carbon price, it will influence behavior but it could be highly regressive. We share the view of many on
the CERT that a balanced approach, involving a suite of well-harmonized policy approaches, is needed to
most effectively achieve carbon reduction in the state. There is no silver bullet.
Like many businesses in the state, at Alaska Airlines, we are firmly committed to reducing our impact on
the environment. We are proud to have reduced our Co2 emissions over 30% per passenger mile since
2004, even as we have grown our fleet of aircraft and expanded our service to more points across North
America. This reduction is in large part due to maintaining a young, all-Boeing fleet, installing winglets on
our aircraft, using cutting-edge satellite navigation technology to fly more efficient routes, and
transitioning to electric ground service equipment. In fact, Alaska Airlines ranked #1 in fuel efficiency
among U.S. domestic air carriers in 2013 by the International Council on Clean Transportation. We are
also pleased to have cut in half the amount of passenger waste we have sent to landfills since 2010,
through our robust recycling programs at Alaska and our regional airline subsidiary, Horizon Air. But
there is much more to do.

77

One key area of focus for Alaska Airlines is to accelerate the development of an aviation biofuels
industry in the state of Washington. We know that fuel efficiency can only achieve so much in the way
of carbon reduction, and that alternative sustainable fuels provide one of the most promising solutions
for reducing airline emissions. Our interest in aviation biofuels dates back to our involvement, as a
founding stakeholder, in Sustainable Aviation Fuels Northwest (SAFN). Following SAFN, in 2011,we
were the first U.S. airline to fly a series of regularly scheduled flights using biofuels. Alaska and
Horizon Air flew 75 flights, from Seattle to Portland, as well as Seattle to Washington DC, with each
flight using a 20% blend of sustainable biofuel made from used cooking oil. Of note, these biofuels
flights cost six times more than conventional fuel, and the biofuel was refined in Texas. In the near
future, we want to partner with local producers and suppliers, who can supply commercial quantities
of biofuel that meet the required quality standards and are cost-competitive with conventional fuels.
To that end, as we look at addressing climate change as a state, at Alaska Airlines, we are interested in
working with other stakeholders to identify and promote the most effective policies to help galvanize
the aviation biofuels industry in the state. Important work has already been done in this policy arena:
The Aviation Biofuels Work Group, in its December 2013 report to the Washington Legislature,
provides valuable input on how to promote this industry. Three of their recommendations are worth
highlighting as the state considers how to support a biofuels industry: Section 5.1 of the report
discusses the importance of aligning state tax policies to support the development of aviation
biofuels, pointing out the well-accepted notion that tax incentives can reduce risks and increase the
likelihood for investment in all parts of the supply chain. Section 5.3 recommends state support for
specific Research and Development efforts in this field, noting how important R&D capacity is to the
state's ability to be a leader in aviation biofuels. Finally, Section 5.5 discusses the value of publicprivate partnerships to enable attractive financing mechanisms to accelerate commercial deployment
of aviation biofuel facilities.
Alaska Airlines looks forward to continuing to engage with interested parties in how to spur
development of the aviation biofuels industry in our state.

Re: POLICY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTION TASKFORCE

Addressing income inequality is crucial to reducing carbon emissions
Two major challenges pose the biggest threat to Washington state’s ability to deliver on the promise of
a better future for our kids and grandkids – climate change and income inequality. At the intersection of
climate change and income inequality is what happens to the resources that everyone needs to live –
clean air, adequate food, safe water, abundant land, and energy – and who has access to them. The
consequences of climate change will dramatically affect the quality and availability of resources; income
inequality will affect how people are protected from and adapt to those consequences.
Climate change policies that do not address rising income inequality are less likely to achieve sufficient
reductions in carbon emissions for the following reasons:


Washingtonians with lower incomes cannot afford to reduce their reliance on carbonintensive energy sources: Without additional resources, it would be especially difficult for
people with fewer social and economic resources to make the expensive investments in
retrofitting homes for energy efficiency, fuel-efficient cars, and other low-carbon infrastructure
and technologies needed to make the program a success.



All Washingtonians – especially those with lower incomes and people of color – are essential
partners in the movement to address climate change: Nearly one-third (two million) of
Washingtonians have incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty line, of which a
disproportionate share are people of color. Faced with sharp increases in fuel and energy costs,
communities with lower incomes may be unable and/or unwilling to support the long-term
goals of carbon reduction.

Successfully addressing climate change, therefore, is dependent on also addressing income inequality.
An effective carbon reduction program must ensure equity by providing Washingtonians from lower
income backgrounds and in communities of color the opportunity to benefit from and participate in the
low-carbon economy of the future. To accomplish this, they must be actively engaged in designing a
carbon reduction program from the outset. In addition, a substantial majority of new carbon revenues
should also be dedicated to helping households with lower incomes and communities of color transition
to a low-carbon economy and ensuring they have access to good-paying “green jobs.”

79

Climate change and income inequality are closely linked
Climate change will profoundly affect the lives of all Washingtonians, but the impact will not be
absorbed equally. Higher income Washingtonians are better able to mitigate or adapt to the impact of a
changing climate than those with lower incomes. Compared to Washingtonians with lower incomes, for
example, families with higher incomes can more easily: afford the costs of resettling in the face of
geographic displacement due to rising sea-levels; absorb the costs of rising food and energy prices; and
afford the advanced technologies that would reduce energy bills, such as solar panels and electric cars,
which are too expensive for people with lower incomes.

An equitable and effective approach to reducing carbon emissions
For any carbon reduction effort to be successful, the needs of communities of color and those from
lower income backgrounds must be recognized and supported in the transition to a low-carbon
economy. Equity, therefore, must be at the forefront of any policy that aims to address climate
change. Incorporating the following strategies while developing and implementing climate change
policy will ensure that all Washingtonians can support the long-term effort to reduce carbon emissions,
and be protected from the threat of climate change:


Invest the vast majority of carbon revenues in ways that further reduce carbon emissions. The
overarching goal of a carbon pricing mechanism is to reduce carbon emissions. Therefore, the bulk
of carbon revenues should be used to ensure reductions are achieved as quickly, efficiently, and
painlessly as possible. Devoting a large portion of carbon revenues toward provisions to help
communities with lower incomes absorb higher energy costs and reduce fossil fuel consumption
would be an effective way to achieve long-term carbon reductions.
Policymakers should avoid using carbon revenues to fund broad-based Business and Occupation
(B&O) tax reductions. Business tax cuts would provide no incentive for businesses to reduce carbon
emissions. And, because these taxes represent a very small share of total business revenues (less
than 1 percent on average, according to the Office of Financial Management), reducing them would
not meaningfully offset higher business costs associated with a carbon reduction program. Sweeping
B&O tax rate reductions would also be expensive, sapping resources that would be more effectively
spent on cash rebates and other targeted programs to help lower income communities thrive in a
low-carbon economy.



Give communities with lower incomes and communities of color top priority for new investments
funded by carbon revenues. A sizeable portion of the revenues from the carbon pricing mechanism
must be set aside for targeted investments in communities of color and those with lower incomes to
mitigate both the environmental impacts of climate change and the higher costs associated with a
carbon pricing mechanism. Furthermore, these communities should be first in line to benefit from
new investments in an efficient energy and transportation infrastructure.

80



Engage and involve communities of color and communities with lower incomes from the start. In
order to ensure the success and sustainability of a carbon pricing mechanism, the most directly
impacted communities must be actively involved in the policy design and mitigation strategies from
inception. These communities know best what works for them and they need policymakers to
listen. Moreover, a growing share of Washington’s population will be disproportionately impacted
by these policies and policymakers will need their support in the long-term.

Policy options to reduce carbon pollution and fight income inequality
Offset higher energy costs by providing direct cash rebates to families
Using a significant portion of carbon revenues to provide direct cash rebates to people with lower-tomoderate incomes would be a simple, cost-effective way to help all Washingtonians transition to a lowcarbon economy. Because every household is situated differently, policies that allow families to be
flexible in how they adapt to higher energy prices are crucial. Direct cash rebates would allow families to
adjust their spending in ways that best suit their individual circumstances.
Options for providing direct cash rebates to disadvantaged communities include:


Funding and increasing the Working Families Tax Rebate. Based on the federal Earned Income
Tax Credit (EITC), the Working Families Tax Rebate (WFTR) would reduce taxes for more than
400,000 Washingtonians, providing them with additional resources to address rising fuel and
energy prices. The WFTR was enacted in 2008, but has yet to be implemented. To improve its
effectiveness policymakers should consider funding it at a higher level – up to 50 percent of the
EITC – and expand eligibility for workers without children.



Enacting a state Child Tax Credit: Policymakers should find ways to provide direct cash rebates
to families with lower- to moderate-incomes who are not eligible for the WFTR because their
incomes are too high or they cannot work due to a disability. Adopting a state version of the
federal Child Tax Credit would boost the impact of the WFTR and would extend rebates to
families with incomes as high as $120,000 per year.



Adopting a state version of the Making Work Pay Credit: Although the federal Making Work
Pay Credit expired in 2010, it remains a good framework for providing cash rebates to middle
class families that would be impacted by rising energy prices under a carbon reduction program.
The Making Work Pay Credit provided credits to workers up to $500 per year. The maximum
credit applied to workers with incomes up to $75,000 per year ($150,000 for a married couple).

Make targeted infrastructure and energy-efficiency improvements
To help reduce carbon emissions quickly and efficiently, policymakers should also invest a sizable
portion of carbon revenues toward improving Washington state’s energy and transportation

81

infrastructure. Communities that are low income, particularly those of color or in rural areas, should be
first in line when it comes to receiving these upgrades. Examples of such investments include:


Expanding public transit and transit oriented development. Better access to affordable and
reliable public transportation would allow people to reduce the amount of time they spend
driving to work and other appointments. Transit subsidies for people with lower incomes would
further reduce the number of carbon-emitting cars on the road.



Assistance purchasing fuel efficient cars. Carbon revenues could be used to help people living in
rural areas – who cannot efficiently be served by public transit – purchase fuel-efficient cars.
Finding ways to help people purchase or lease electric cars at affordable rates could help
stimulate demand for these vehicles, spurring greater carbon reduction. A general sales tax
reduction or other untargeted tax breaks for electric cars would be far less effective, as much of
the value would go to higher-income people who don’t need a tax break.



Building new energy infrastructure in depressed areas. New, efficient energy generation and
distribution technologies – such as “smart grids” or “solar highways” -- should be built in areas
with high unemployment or below average incomes first.



Improving in public health infrastructure. New mapping technologies can help identify
communities that would be hardest hit by climate change, and resources can be targeted to
those at the greatest risk. In addition, strategic communications and outreach can help prepare
Washingtonians most at-risk educating them on how best to protect themselves from the
consequences of climate change, such as rising temperatures or flooding.



Offer free or low-cost energy retrofits to communities with lower incomes. Utilities are a
significant component of overall housing costs for households with lower incomes. Providing
direct assistance for weatherization and other home energy efficiency improvements would
help struggling families reduce their natural gas and electricity bills while reducing carbon
emissions statewide. The policies must also take into account that many of these families are
renters and be designed accordingly.



Expanding investments that help families meet basic needs. In addition to direct cash rebates,
carbon revenues could be used to increase funding for the Basic Food Program and other antihunger efforts, and to provide utility subsidies for families with lower incomes, all of which
would help to counteract the damaging effects of basic needs.

Ensure all Washingtonians have a stake in the low-carbon economy
For people from lower income backgrounds and communities of color to embrace carbon reduction
efforts, they must be convinced that doing so will benefit their kids and grandkids. Therefore, it is
essential to ensure these communities have opportunities to shape and participate in the low-carbon

82

economy policymakers seek to build. To create these opportunities, any carbon reduction policy should
include:


Efforts to include residents of communities with lower incomes in “green technology”
research and development. Extra tuition supports should be provided to for college students
from low income backgrounds seeking careers in developing and building advanced,
environmentally technologies. Furthermore, new environmental technology research facilities
should be located in areas with high unemployment or below average incomes. A new research
center located in Yakima, Aberdeen, Federal Way, or South Park, for example, could have a
much bigger impact on the local community than adding another facility in South Lake Union or
Bellevue.



Access to new green jobs that pay a living wage. To the greatest extent possible, residents of
communities with lower incomes and people of color should be hired to build and maintain a
new energy infrastructure. To do so, they should also have access to specialized training
programs.

To: CERT co-chairs
From: Steve Wright
Re: Supplemental Comments to Carbon Emissions Reduction Task Force
I want to begin by thanking Governor Inslee for the opportunity to participate in this important
task force.
1. Taskforce Charter - It is important to understand this task force in terms of the charter
provided by the Governor. The CERT Task Force was not asked whether a price should be
placed on greenhouse gas emissions but how. Relative to the CERT's mission, the salient
portion of the Governor's Executive Order states:
The Governor’s Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce is hereby created to
provide recommendations on the design and implementation of a carbon
emission limits and market mechanisms program for Washington. The
Taskforce’s advice and recommendations will inform legislation to be requested
by the Governor for consideration during the 2015 legislative session. The
carbon emissions reduction program must establish a cap on carbon pollution
emissions, with binding requirements to meet our statutory emission limits, and
it must include the market mechanisms needed to meet the limits in the most
effective and efficient manner possible. The program must be designed to
maximize the benefits and minimize the implementation costs, considering our
emissions and energy sources, and our businesses and jobs.
This charter led the Task Force to focus its efforts on the choices regarding various forms of
carbon pricing. Hence, the report does not speak to whether a price on carbon should be
adopted.
2. Program design details are crucial - A fundamental issue discussed by the Task Force was
whether a cap/trade versus tax approach was preferable. Based on what we learned
through this process, I believe that the most important question is not which approach, but
rather what associated policies will be adopted with either approach. Under either
approach, success or failure will depend on design details and how they interact with
related public policies. The challenges, however, of ameliorating the downsides of a cap and
trade system are greater than those associated with a tax. There are inherent difficulties in
managing a market that create a larger administrative burden than managing a tax and
more opportunities for unintended consequences that are difficult to remedy.
3. Additional analytics needed to assess the relative benefits of program linkage - A cap-andtrade system also must address the issue of whether to link to other programs in order to
increase the market size and liquidity necessary for reducing price volatility risk given that
the Washington State market is not that large. Yet there was not enough time to

84

appropriately address the analytics behind this issue to determine whether Washington
State would be advantaged by the market size advantages of liquidity or disadvantaged due
to the relative cost of carbon emissions in Washington State compared against other
jurisdictions. There should be a significant advantage to be gained because clearly linkage
would lead to a loss of autonomy compared against a Washington State-focused program.
4. Economic impacts need further analysis - Much of the information the CERT reviewed
summarized experiences in other places. The economic analysis performed by OFM,
however, was a unique contribution that directly addresses impacts of a carbon price in
Washington State. This analysis addresses the most important question at a
macroeconomic level - How much carbon reduction can be achieved, at what price, and at
what cost to the economy? The analysis is preliminary and incomplete, but it identifies
some very intriguing results:
a. Revenue recycling choices are critical to economic outcomes - There is the potential
that the statewide net macroeconomic impact (employment, personal income, and
GDP) of any price on carbon can be effectively neutral. This seems to be because
the underlying assumption is revenue removed from the economy is effectively
recycled. An area that the Task Force did not have an opportunity to explore is the
effect of various approaches to revenue recycling. The impacts on individual
economic sectors also appeared to be small but this may also have been because of
the assumptions for how revenues are recycled or because of the limited ability to
explore individual economic sectors. A tentative conclusion is that the structuring of
revenue recycling is critical to both macroeconomic and individual sector effects.
b. Effectiveness of various tax reduction policies should be analyzed - The analysis
provided to the Task Force assumed that 95% of the revenues collected from a
carbon price are recycled in the form of a reduction in existing taxes with a
spreading approach between business and personal tax reductions. This approach
appears to have produced a mostly neutral economic impact compared against no
price on carbon, suggesting it should be used as a starting point for discussion to
compare alternative strategies against. There are, however, important
considerations that deserve further discussion. For example, agriculture does not
pay the B&O tax and hence would not derive the benefits from revenue recycling,
although clearly it would be impacted by increases in fuel prices. These sorts of
adjustments based on further analysis would be critical to a successfully designed
program. Moreover, there is a very important macroeconomic discussion to be had
about what types of tax reduction policies (e.g. reducing marginal capital vs. labor
tax rates reductions) create the most economic benefit and equity.
c. Carbon pricing should achieve cost-effective and efficient reductions - - The analysis
indicates that a price that rises from $12 to $15 by 2020 and then to $45 by 2035
will not be adequate to meet the carbon emissions reductions target in current state
law. The charge given to the Task Force was to identify means to achieve this target.

85

Alternatively, a price that rises from $12 to $52 by 2020 and then to $172 by 2035
may achieve the state target for the sectors covered according to the OFM analysis.
A 2035 price at this level would produce roughly $6.5 billion annually. These are
2014 dollars. The analysis suggests: (a) prices well beyond those currently
experienced in other jurisdictions that have adopted a carbon price would be
necessary to achieve the state targets using current technology; (b) prices of this
magnitude would suggest a substantial need for technology initiatives to reduce the
cost of carbon emissions reductions; and (c) programmatic efforts to reduce carbon
outside of pricing mechanisms should be measured against the prices suggested in
this analysis to determine whether they are adding value compared against a carbon
price or are duplicative of what would be accomplished with a pricing regime. This
last point is particularly important because the overarching goal of placing a price on
carbon is to achieve emissions reductions targets in the most cost-efficient manner.
Complementary programs that address carbon emission reductions should be
evaluated for whether they are increasing or decreasing efficiency compared against
a carbon price.
d. Marginal abatement cost curves need to be analyzed - I want to specifically endorse
the Task Force conclusion that additional work should be done on carbon emission
marginal abatement curves, a term that only economists could love. To put it more
simply, if we are going to seek out the most cost-effective means to reduce carbon
emissions, we must have an analysis that provides a supply curve of potential carbon
emissions reductions compared against price. This would allow policymakers to: (1)
assess the best means for achieving emissions reductions, including where market
mechanisms may fail; (2) consider the best opportunities for investments in
technology that can reduce future carbon emissions reductions; and (3) get a sense
of the likely total cost of achieving various targets.
e. Further work should tackle the question of which sectors are covered - An important
question that the Task Force did not get a sufficient answer to is whether all sources
of GHG emissions were covered by the analysis and if, in fact, the high price scenario
will accomplish the statewide emissions target. There was some discussion, but not
a clear conclusion, that some portions of the transportation sector may have been
excluded from the analysis. This issue should be a high priority for further analysis.
5. Climate adaptation strategy can address risk, identify opportunities - While the analysis
would suggest revenue recycling that focuses on reduction of existing taxes produces
neutral economic impacts, the Task Force report identifies other forms of spending as
options to be considered. If these ideas are pursued, then options for addressing
adaptation strategies should be part of the discussion. Adaptation strategies that employ
good planning and incentives would create means to minimize negative impacts and seek
out opportunities to take advantage of an altered climate. For example, with agricultural
production being a significant component of the Washington State economy, it would be
worthwhile considering whether a threat can be turned into an opportunity.

86

6. There are a set of modeling issues that are likely to have significant impacts and are worth
pursuing as the analysis is further developed: (1) REMI models generally have difficulty
addressing export industry competitiveness which is critical to Washington state industries
(e.g. tree fruit and aluminum production), (2) how the working families tax credit will work
in practice, (3) there are counter-intuitive results that carbon-emitting industries will see
job growth with a carbon price, (4) the price shock of higher price increases are difficult to
model, and (5) the cost and effectiveness of carbon abatement options embedded in the
model have been subject to substantial debate in other analyses.

As it was made clear from the beginning of the exercise, the Governor wanted to hear a variety
of views on this subject and was not seeking "votes" on the policies being discussed. I am
comfortable that the Task Force report provides a fair representation of the discussions held by
the Task Force and would ask that these views be considered as a supplement to the report. I
want to specifically thank the co-chairs and the facilitator for their management of the process
to assure all Task Force member voices were heard.

Office of the Governor
PO Box 40002
Olympia, WA 98504-0002
Dear Ms. Healey and Mr. Brown,
On behalf of the United Steelworkers (USW) and our 850,000 members, I want to thank you for your
efforts leading the 21-member Carbon Emissions Reduction Taskforce (CERT). USW has been an active
member of the CERT and we are eager to see the state of Washington develop an effective, flexible
approach to reducing carbon emissions and while maximizing job creation and job security.
As we have stated in prior communications to Governor Inslee, USW support for carbon emission policies is
guided by the principle that Americans deserve both environmental sustainability and economic
prosperity. We see that approach as consistent with the preamble of Governor’s Executive Order 14-04
establishing the CERT, which states "it is critical to Washington's economic future that greenhouse gas
reduction strategies be designed and implemented in a manner that minimizes cost impacts to Washington
citizens and businesses." We believe USW’s approach is also consistent with the Executive Order’s aim to “be
designed to maximize the benefits and minimize the implementation costs, considering our emissions and
energy sources, and our businesses and jobs.”
USW believes we do not have to choose between economic and environmental progress, but that we can
and must implement solutions to ensure both. Indeed, if the state of Washington implements a carbon
reduction policy that reduces carbon but harms working people by sending jobs out of state or overseas,
we all will have failed. We must therefore chart a policy course that simultaneously achieves sciencebased carbon reduction targets while creating and securing jobs, including those in the state’s existing
energy-intensive and trade-exposed manufacturing sector.
Last week we received the November 3 draft CERT Report to the Washington State Governor’s Office and
we have conducted an internal review. In this memo we will share some specific comments on that draft
as well as broader comments and recommendations on the state’s overall approach.
To begin, we are pleased to see that the draft report includes language responding to earlier USW
comments and inputs, including – but not limited to – the following examples:

88

1. There is now mention of the need to further identify and analyze specific impacts (including job
impacts) on "vulnerable industries dependent on fossil fuels.”
2. There is new language summarizing CERT discussions about the use of carbon pricing revenues that
incorporates competitiveness challenges in trade-exposed industries, including those in which our
members work, including aluminum.
3. The description of job training is now improved and states that such programs can be "targeted at
Washington residents, particularly low-income and minority residents and current employees in
impacted industries and emitting facilities (and) can be directed toward the needs of infrastructure
investment projects and support maximum job creation and existing job security.” The reference to
existing job security is important for the USW.
4. There are additional improvements to the workforce development language, including the need to
fund training programs to develop skills needed to perform the duties of “green jobs.”
We have also reviewed the report and will flag for fellow CERT members the following:
1. In Finding 4 (Page 3), the report says that one of the areas needing further analysis is “… identifying
and analyzing the impacts (including job loss particularly for vulnerable fossil fuel dependent
industries) to low/moderate income and vulnerable communities of both climate change and carbon
pricing.” We agree with this need, but we want this section to make clear that workers in fossil fuel
dependent industries should be considered vulnerable. We suggest these changes: “… identifying
and analyzing the impacts (including job loss particularly for IN vulnerable fossil fuel dependent
industries) to VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, INCLUDING WORKERS, low/moderate income and
vulnerable communities of both climate change and carbon pricing.”
2. Regarding the Preliminary Economic Modeling Scenarios (Pages 9 and 10), we refer fellow CERT
members to a September 30, 2014 memo – and accompanying summary document – sent to
Governor Inslee’s staff on October 6. The memo was prepared for USW District 12 by Heidi GarrettPeltier, PhD, Political Economy Research Institute (PERI), University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and
catalogues a series of questions and concerns about the economic modeling.
3. In Section 3 addressing the Evaluation Framework (Page 10), we strongly support the third of the
eight framework topics that proposes a strategy to address the particular vulnerability of some of
USW’s key employers:
… certain business and industries in Washington could face higher production costs compared to
competitors in regions where carbon costs have not been accounted for and internalized. In particular,
energy-intensive and trade-exposed business and industries are likely to face greater competitiveness
risks due to a carbon price. Companies could choose to relocate to those regions without a carbon price to
maintain their competitiveness in the global marketplace; this would lead to relocation rather than
reduction of emissions, a risk referred to as “carbon leakage”. By directing revenues (or tax rebates or
exemptions or free allowances) to energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries in Washington, market
mechanisms can reduce or eliminate competitiveness concerns. Free allowance distribution, under an
emissions-based system, or tax rebates or exemptions as mentioned above, under a price-based system,
can be energy efficiency-based (or production-based). Companies would have the potential to raise
revenue by selling allowances if they reduce emissions through increases in energy efficiency.
USW also continues to maintain that the fourth of the eight framework topics should more clearly
express the perspectives of CERT members and not only address job growth, but also “job security.”

89

Overall, as CERT prepares final recommendations, we believe the following underlying concepts should
be built into any comprehensive policy designed to reduce carbon emissions:


Investments in Jobs

Revenue generated by market programs should be allocated to create and secure family-sustaining job
opportunities for all workers. Revenue allocation programs should include incentives and/or regulations
that reward business for energy efficiency investments made at energy intensive facilities beyond
“business as usual” – as well as workforce development training to ensure existing and new workers can
participate in emerging sectors.
Beyond energy efficiency, generated revenues should be used to spur investment in grid modernization
and the development and deployment of clean energy technologies, such as wind, biomass, solar and
nuclear.


Leakage Protection

Leakage, the phenomenon whereby production of various goods moves out of state – along with jobs
and carbon pollution – to areas with weaker environmental laws, poses a real threat to job security for
USW members. Washington’s carbon reduction policies should address and combat leakage to ensure a
level playing field between in-state and out-of-state companies and prevent jobs from leaving.
Washington State should also consider incentivizing carbon reduction opportunities in carbon-intensive
industries through a tiered rebate approach that takes a portion of the allowance pool and provides
rebates tied to the direct and indirect compliance costs to energy intensive industries. These rebates
would be pegged to efficiency, so the more efficient a producer, the greater the rebate.
Spurring direct and timely capital investment in appropriate technologies can reduce lifecycle emissions
of facilities in Washington. Such an incentive program should ensure new investments are above-andbeyond other requirements or business-as-usual and include careful accounting for real, verified
emission reductions. In addition to reducing GHGs and preserving industries in Washington, spurring
these technologies and investments could have additional benefits in terms of reduced criteria pollution
beyond carbon emissions.
Additionally, Washington should try to harmonize its leakage policies with other states and regions. A
regional approach will strengthen the region’s ability to address leakage issues stemming from products
imported from states or other countries that lack carbon reduction laws and/or regulations.


Promote Domestic Content

As Washington considers the use of incentives and/or regulations to address carbon reduction goals, the
state should determine policies that promote and maximize the use of domestic content. For example,
potential carbon-reducing policies may incentivize and/or regulate investments in new infrastructure
development and/or retrofits including renewable or clean energy, building energy efficiency retrofits
(residential, commercial and industrial) and public transportation. Where tax dollars are used,
Washington should place a preference on domestically-sourced products such as steel and cement for
the construction and modernization of infrastructure associated with meeting WA carbon mitigation
goals.
In addition, we urge funding for research to support the study of the carbon footprint of imported goods
used for major infrastructure and building efficiency projects. Research is needed to analyze the costs of
those imports (e.g. the carbon emissions associated with imported steel made in highly energy intensive
facilities) and the overall environmental benefits of domestically manufactured goods.

90



Compliance Flexibility

Carbon reduction for energy intensive industries should provide regulated parties with the ability to
comply with requirements through various means throughout the production cycle of finished goods.
Washington state should also consider a phased in approach for regulated sectors similar to California’s
AB 32 and Waxman-Markey.
-- -- -Again, we thank you for leading the CERT as it prepares recommendations for Governor Inslee
addressing policy approaches to reduce greenhouse gas mitigation policies. We look forward to working
together on the successful creation and implementation of Washington state policies that reduce
climate change while creating and maintaining family-sustaining jobs.
