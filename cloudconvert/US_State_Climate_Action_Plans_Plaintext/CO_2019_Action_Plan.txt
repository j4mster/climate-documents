THE VISION
Governor Polis ran on a bold platform of achieving 100% Renewable Energy by 2040. This goal is
motivated by the moral imperative to fight climate change and curb pollution of our air and water, as
well as the opportunity to drive innovation and harness the consumer savings and economic benefits of leading the transition to a clean energy economy. This is our roadmap to achieve this goal.
This transition is already underway and shows no signs of slowing down. The two fastest-growing
professions in the United States are solar photovoltaic installers and wind turbine service technicians.
Fourteen Colorado towns and counties have already taken the initiative and adopted the goal of
getting 100% of their electricity from clean renewable energy: Denver, Pueblo, Boulder, Fort Collins,
Summit County, Frisco, Aspen, Glenwood Springs, Breckenridge, Longmont, Lafayette, Nederland to
Golden. These diverse communities know that protecting Colorado’s way of life means doing our
part to combat climate change, and that swiftly adopting renewable energy in our electricity sector
and then extending the impact of that clean electricity across the economy will protect the health of
our communities, create good paying jobs, strengthen our economy and keep rates low for customers.

POLIS ADMINISTRATION'S: ROADMAP TO 100%
RENEWABLE ENERGY BY 2040 AND BOLD CLIMATE ACTION
THE VISION (continued)
The Polis Administration has taken a number of significant steps that make a down payment on
our commitment to 100% renewable energy by 2040. By partnering with the Legislature, we’ve
empowered the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to facilitate a rapid transition to renewable energy
across the state that includes working with our largest utility to invest in renewable energy and meet
a goal of reducing greenhouse gas pollution 80% by 2030. We’re building a regulatory framework
that will enable the PUC to work with our second largest utility to transition from coal-fired power to
cheaper, cleaner sources of renewable energy. We are also making it easier for individual Coloradans
to participate by expanding access to energy efficiency and community solar gardens. Additionally,
the Legislature passed House Bill 1261, which sets economy-wide targets for reducing greenhouse
gas pollution, with goals of 26% reduction by 2025 below 2005 levels, 50% reduction by 2030 and
90% reduction by 2050, and delegates authority to the Air Quality Control Commission to adopt rules
to make progress towards those goals.
One of the most important parts of our transition to cleaner energy is electrifying transportation in
Colorado. In order to meet the Governor’s goal of 940,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by
2030, state agencies have taken a number of steps, including allocating approximately $14 million to
transit agencies across the state to deploy cleaner buses. The agencies are also expeditiously establishing public-private partnerships to build 33 fast charging stations along major highways in the state.
Working with the Legislature, we’ve also made it easier for utilities, with oversight from the PUC, to
invest in electric vehicle infrastructure.
While we’ve already taken important strides towards our renewable energy vision, there’s much
work to do. The policies adopted this legislative session provide the foundation for much higher
levels of renewable energy integration, but additional strategies will be needed to get to 100% by
2040. It’s going to take the perspective, expertise, and commitment from diverse voices across the
state to forge a renewable energy future that works for all of Colorado. Together, we can do our part
to fight climate change, improve air quality and the health of our communities, diversify and
strengthen our economy across the state, and ensure the good-paying jobs of the quickly growing
green energy economy are created here in Colorado.
