Michigan Climate Action Council’s
Recommended Policy Positions
on Michigan Climate Action Strategy
Michigan is in a period of extraordinary transition and faces unprecedented challenges. Among
the most compelling of these challenges is the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions to address climate change and its impact on our health, our natural resources and our
way of life. As part of this challenge, the economic core of our prosperity, the automobile
industry, is undergoing tumultuous change as we move from a high carbon to a low carbon
economy and a new energy future. Revenues to address government services are declining and
are expected to do so in the foreseeable future. In addressing these issues, in response to climate
change, we have the unique opportunity to also encourage deployment of new investment and
technologies, save energy and money, create new jobs and income, promote energy
independence and sustainability, and diversify and grow our economy. The magnitude of the
challenge will require a remarkable level of cooperation among all levels of government.
The policy direction is clear. Michigan should seize this moment and take a leadership role in
formulating and promoting efficient, effective national, regional and state polices to address
climate change. These policies should holistically address the economy, renewable energy,
climate change, energy efficiency and independence.
There are two integrated parts to Michigan’s Climate Action Strategy. The first is based on
state-based advocacy for strong national and international action on climate change. A
framework describing the key elements of a national climate policy is summarized in Part One
below.
The second part requires integration of national climate action policies and efforts with those that
the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) recommends for implementation in Michigan to
achieve significant reductions in GHG emissions. This represents a call to action by State
government, business, and the general public to confront the issue of climate change. It contains
actions that we can take now within our state to simultaneously address climate change while
transitioning our economy by, promoting new technology development, improving energy
efficiency, conserving natural resources, and developing clean and renewable energy sources.
These two policy trajectories are essential, coequal and intertwined.

x

Part One: Michigan Platform on Climate Change
The purpose of this platform is to assist Governor Granholm and other Michigan leaders as they
represent Michigan in various forums on the topic of climate change. This includes the New
Administration, U.S. Congress as well as the existing and emerging industry-based, nongovernmental, and multi-state alliances on global warming.
•

Michigan should take action now to address climate change. That action should take two
forms: 1) specific actions to reduce GHG emissions in the state and region, and 2) active
engagement in the development of a national climate policy.

•

Governor Granholm is already taking steps to diversify Michigan’s economy using
alternative energy to create and retain jobs. Michigan should pursue policies and
programs that leverage the State’s existing knowledge and expertise to strengthen the
auto and other manufacturing sectors and to further diversify the economic base of the
State in the renewable energy, energy efficiency and natural resource conservation
sectors.

•

A national commitment to make significant reductions in GHG emissions will require a
transformation of our energy, manufacturing and transportation systems. There will be
economic costs and benefits associated with this transformation. Therefore, it is critical
that a national climate policy optimizes economic efficiency, equity, and cost
effectiveness. Michigan should advocate for the development of such a policy within the
framework of a federal-state partnership. While the design, implementation and
integration of federal, state and local GHG reduction policies present important issues to
be resolved by federal and state policymakers, there is broad agreement that, in our
system of government, all levels of government must work together in partnership if the
nation is to effectively address this challenge.

•

Although national climate policy could be based on alternatives to or additions to “cap
and trade” (such as tax, subsidy, standards, and technical assistance policies), federal
legislation is most likely to focus on a cap and trade and sector based programs. 1
Michigan therefore should advocate for a national cap and trade program that is efficient,
equitable, economy wide, and based on a federal-state partnership. This should include
sector based policies and measures that reduce market and institutional barriers to GHG
reduction. The state should press for enactment of this legislation by 2010.

•

Federal legislation should include national emission reduction targets.

•

Federal legislation must be structured in a manner that drives immediate GHG
reductions.

1

Although the New Administration and Congress are likely to pursue a nationwide cap and trade policy, other
options remain available. The alternative most often mentioned is a carbon tax. If this alternative becomes the
preferred approach, the comments and recommendations made herein also largely apply to a carbon tax, i.e., it must
be fair from a revenue standpoint, efficient, equitable and effective, and not place Michigan residents and
businesses at a disadvantage.
xi

•

Federal legislation should ensure GHG emissions are truly reduced and not just shifted
from one state or region to another nor from one sector to another.

•

The national program should encourage rapid technology development and deployment
through the adoption of technology supporting and inducing policies. Cost efficiency and
co-benefits should also be considered in achieving reductions of GHG emissions to
assure that the timing of reductions coincides with the successful commercialization of
emerging technologies. Major reductions from certain sectors may most effectively be
accomplished if based on aggressive yet appropriate lead times that allow the necessary
infrastructure to be put in place. Examples include carbon sequestration, low-carbon
fuels, and commercial viability of high-density energy storage systems.

•

While the need for action is now, there are remaining uncertainties regarding the pace at
which technologies and markets will develop. Instead of waiting to act, the federal
legislation should provide for periodic review so that adjustments can be made based on
evolving knowledge of technologies, markets, emission reduction needs and other
circumstances.

•

Recognizing that effective measures to address climate change depend on international
action, the United States should take the lead in facilitating global participation.

•

Market forces and current federal legislation already are increasing vehicle fuel economy.
Any federal policies adopted should not put the domestic auto industry at a competitive
disadvantage.

•

To the extent reasonably practical and feasible, the costs and benefits of achieving
varying degrees of GHG reductions should be fully disclosed and discussed as part of a
deliberative process in the State and nationally, including health, environment, energy
and economic impacts, as well as recognition of both monetized and non-monetized
impacts.

•

A national cap-and-trade program should include appropriate measures to provide a
degree of long-term cost certainty and temper wide fluctuations in the price of allowances
that would be economically harmful to the U.S. while guarding against any negative
impact on GHG emission reductions targets and timetables. Without approving any
particular measure, the MCAC notes that examples of such potential measures are
identified in Market Based Policy -1.

•

Care should be taken to avoid unintended consequences. For example, the national
program should not result in actions that make it more difficult to protect human health
and the environment through attaining national air quality standards or is hampered by
inconsistent policies in other areas.

•

Revenue derived from the regulation of GHGs should be used to assist with the
transformation to a low carbon economy through appropriate incentives and subsidies for
the development and deployment of GHG-reducing technologies and to mitigate
increased costs to the consumers. The revenues that exit the state should return at the
same proportion, with the exception of that percentage dedicated to technology research,
development, and deployment at the national level.

xii

Part Two: Michigan Emission Reduction Proposals
1. The Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) has developed a comprehensive list of
policy recommendations to reduce GHG emissions in Michigan. Michigan should take
immediate steps to implement the policy recommendations of the MCAC establishing
priorities to significantly reduce GHG emissions in the State. To begin this, the State
should immediately calculate and publish the expected GHG reductions expected from
the recent comprehensive energy legislation related to the Renewable Portfolio Standard
(RPS) and Energy Efficiency programs as well as other recent and planned actions.
2. The MCAC also recommends that public education be a top priority in the State’s climate
action plan. A number of the MCAC recommendations are achievable in the short run.
However, success is predicated on the will of the public to change its behavior. Michigan
should aggressively move to inform the public of its choices for achieving GHG
reductions and the cost of those choices. The public should be encouraged to participate
in order to reduce costs. The success or failure of this effort should be tracked as part of
evolving implementation of the State’s climate change efforts, and the results should be
disclosed to the public.
3. The MCAC further suggests that Michigan leverage the resources of its outstanding
higher education system to promote international cooperative research pacts for the
development of alternative energy sources and energy efficiency technologies.
4. Additionally, the MCAC recommends a multi-year strategy for inventorying, tracking
and verifying GHG emissions and progress against state goals and targets must be
developed and implemented so that progress towards state goals and targets can be
accurately assessed.

Executive Summary
Background
Governor Jennifer Granholm signed Executive Order 2007-42 creating the Michigan Climate
Action Council (MCAC) on November 14, 2007. The MCAC was charged with producing a
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions inventory and forecast, compiling a comprehensive Climate
Action Plan with recommended GHG reduction goals and potential actions to mitigate climate
change in various sectors of the economy, and advising state and local governments on measures
to address climate change.
The MCAC began its deliberations in December 2007. The MCAC held eight meetings leading
to this Final Report which constitutes the Michigan Climate Action Plan (Climate Action Plan).
In order to provide a broad range of technical expertise and stakeholder involvement in
development of the Climate Action Plan, the MCAC formed six Technical Work Groups
(TWGs) to assist in the process. The six TWGs considered information and potential options in
the following sectors:
•

Energy Supply (ES);

•

Market Based Policies (MBP);

•

Residential, Commercial and Industrial (RCI);

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW); and

•

Cross-Cutting Issues (CCI) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) provided facilitation and technical assistance to the
MCAC and each of the TWGs. The TWGs served as advisors to the MCAC and consisted of
MCAC members and additional individuals with interest and expertise. Members of the public
were invited to observe and provide input at all meetings of the MCAC and TWGs. The TWGs
assisted the MCAC by generating initial Michigan-specific policy options to be added to the
catalog of existing states actions; developing priority policy options for analysis; drafting
proposals on the design characteristics and quantification of the proposed policy options;
reviewing specifications for analysis of draft policy options (including best available data
sources, methods and assumptions); and evaluating the other key elements of policy option
proposals, including related policies and programs, key uncertainties, co-benefits and costs,
feasibility issues, and potential barriers to consensus.

ExS-1

Key Elements and Recommendations
The MCAC developed this Climate Action Plan as an initial step in establishing a basis for
moving forward on the implementation of climate change policies in Michigan. Evaluation
of key factors such as cost effectiveness, economic impacts, and harmonization with other
Michigan programs and policies will be critical to the next stage of climate policy
implementation.
The following key elements and recommendations were identified by the MCAC during this
initial process:
•

The MCAC's proposed GHG reduction goals for Michigan are to achieve a 20%
reduction of GHGs below 2005 levels by 2020 and an 80% reduction below 2005 levels
by 2050. These goals are consistent with goals being considered by the Midwestern
Governors Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord process. The MCAC
recommends that they be officially established as the states’ GHG reduction goals.

•

MCAC reviewed over 330 multi-sector policy options and approved for inclusion in this
report a package of 54 policy recommendations to reduce GHG emissions and address
related energy and commerce issues in Michigan. 52 of these 54 recommendations were
approved unanimously and only one option was rejected. The recommended policy
options cover a wide range of costs and GHG reduction potentials.

•

In moving towards implementation to achieve these goals, Michigan must prioritize these
54 policy recommendations during 2009 in order to set the stage for strategic
implementation of the most promising options. The prioritization should take into
account the GHG reduction potential, costs and savings, feasibility, co-benefits, and a
macro-economic analysis of selected recommendations, and consistency with other
Michigan programs and policies.

•

The MCAC approved policy recommendations are estimated to generate a net cumulative
savings of about $10 billion between 2009 and 2025. The weighted-average costeffectiveness of these policies is estimated to be approximately a $10.2/ tCO2e cost
savings. Those policy options that show negative costs 1 (i.e. benefits) should be
evaluated as quickly as possible. All policy options, particularly those that show a net
cost, should be evaluated thoroughly, using tools such as regional economic modeling,
before being implemented.

•

The MCAC recommends periodic review of Michigan’s progress with appropriate
adjustments made in the Climate Action Plan to assure the approaches taken and GHG
reductions are on target. Michigan’s GHG Inventory and Forecast has been prepared
which outlines historical conditions for 1990-2005 and projected emissions through 2025

1

Policy options that are “negative cost” are not necessarily better than other potential investments. In capital
constrained situations only a limited number of investments can be made. There may be structural or policy barriers
to the adoption of options identified as negative cost.
ExS-2

based upon a business as usual scenario. These documents were completed prior to the
severe downturn in the global economy. To account for fluctuations such as changes in
the economy, updates to this inventory should be performed annually with the projections
evaluated every three years.
•

The MCAC recommends that Michigan further analyze actions needed for adaptation.
The MCAC was unable to examine the impacts of climate change on Michigan’s natural
resources and the Great Lakes due to time and resource constraints. Therefore, the
MCAC recommends that Michigan conduct additional analyses of the state’s
vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and develop specific adaptation plans for
key sectors.

•

MCAC recommends that Michigan position itself as a leader in the national and regional
dialogue on climate change policy as described in the MCAC’s Recommended Policy
Positions Section of this report.

Michigan GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared the Michigan Inventory and Forecast Report
for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The report presents an
assessment of Michigan’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon
storage) from 1990 to 2025. The preliminary draft inventory and forecast estimates in January
2008 served as a starting point for the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) and Technical
Work Groups (TWGs). The inventory and forecast were revised to address the comments
received. The final Inventory and Forecast Report was approved by the MCAC at the November
2008 meeting and is available at:
http://www.miclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm .
The inventory and projections cover the six types of gases included in the United States (US)
Greenhouse Gas Inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions
of these GHGs are presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates
the relative contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a
global warming potential- (GWP-) weighted basis 2 .
As illustrated in Figure ExS-1, below, activities in Michigan accounted for approximately 248
million metric tons (MMt) of gross 3 CO2e emissions (consumption basis) in 2005, an amount

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system (IPCC, 2001). Holding everything else
constant, increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net
increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth), See: Boucher, O., et al. “Radiative Forcing of Climate Change.”

equal to about 3.5% of total US gross GHG emissions (based on 2005 US data). 4 Gross
emissions exclude carbon sinks, such as forests. Michigan’s gross GHG emissions are rising
slower than those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005, Michigan’s gross GHG emissions
increased by about 12%, while national emissions rose by 16%. The growth in Michigan’s
emissions was primarily associated with electricity consumption and the transportation sector.
The principal sources of Michigan’s GHG emissions are electricity consumption; residential,
commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use; and transportation accounting for 36, 24, and 24% of
Michigan’s gross GHG emissions in 2005, respectively.
Also illustrated in Figure ExS-1 under the reference case projections, Michigan’s gross GHG
emissions are projected to continue growing, to approximately 292 MMtCO2e by 2025, 32%
above 1990 levels. While these projections are made over the long term (e.g. to 2025), they do
not account for the current severe global economic downturn and how this will impact future
growth projections.

Recent Actions
GHG Reductions Associated With Recent Federal and State Actions
The MCAC identified recent actions undertaken in Michigan that will reduce GHG emissions
while conserving energy and promoting the development and use of renewable energy sources.
One such action was the adoption of PA 295 5 . The resultant emission reductions were estimated.
Reductions associated with federal actions, such as the federal Energy Independence and
Security Act (EISA) of 2007 and the implementation of the Act’s Corporate Average Fuel
Economy (CAFE) requirements, were also estimated. A total reduction of about 8.9 MMtCO2e
(3.1%) in 2025 from the business-as-usual reference case emissions is projected. These GHG
emission reductions are summarized in Figure ExS-3.

MCAC Policy Recommendations (Beyond Recent Actions)
The MCAC approved 54 policy recommendations for action in Michigan. Of these, 33 were
analyzed quantitatively to calculate both emission reductions and either costs or savings. Based
on this analysis, the 33 quantified policies have the cumulative effect of reducing annual GHG
emissions by approximately 41 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in
2015 and by 117 MMtCO2e in 2025. The additional policy recommendations were not readily
quantifiable but are considered valuable recommendations to support the overall Climate Action
Plan. Several of the non-quantified policy recommendations may have the potential to achieve
GHG emission reductions.
Figure ExS-4 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the 33 quantified policy options and federal actions relative to the business-asusual reference case projections.
•

The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
2020 and 2025) levels of Michigan’s gross GHG emissions on a business as usual basis.

•

The red line shows the projected emissions adjusted for the recent state and federal actions
described in Figure ExS-3.

•

The green line shows the projected emissions if all of the MCAC’s 33 recommended options
are implemented and the estimated reductions are fully achieved. It is important to note, to
yield these emission reductions from the 33 MCAC recommended options, implementation
must be timely, aggressive, and thorough.

Table ExS-1, below, provides the numeric estimates underlying Figure ES-4. In summary, if all
of the Policy Recommendations are fully implemented and successful in achieving all of the
GHG reductions projected then MI should over-achieve its GHG reduction goals by 7.3
MMtCO2e in 2020. Another way to look at this is that the MCAC package of policy
recommendations entails a surplus of GHG reductions of about 7.3MMTCO2e.

Table ExS-2 depicts the final policy recommendations of the Council and their associated GHG
reductions and costs or savings for each sector.
What do the numbers mean? In Table ExS-2 and throughout the Climate Action Plan, positive
cost figures ( $) indicate costs; negative cost (- $) figures indicate cost savings. For example, in
Table ExS-2 the column totals for the Net Present Value (NPV) of (-$10,093 million) portrays a
cost savings of $10,093,000,000 over the 2009- 2025 period of analysis.

Notes for Table ExS-2 are continued on the next page.
Negative values in the Net Present Value and the Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings associated
with the policy options.
Within each sector, values have been adjusted to eliminate double counting for policies or elements of policies that
overlap. In addition, values associated with policies or elements of policies within a sector that overlap with policies or
elements of policies in another sector have been adjusted to eliminate double counting. Appendix F (for the ES
sectors), Appendix H (for the RCI sectors), Appendix I (for the TLU sectors), and Appendix J (for the AFW sectors) of
this report provide documentation of how sector-level emission reductions and costs (or cost savings) were adjusted
to eliminate double counting associated with overlaps between policies.

Table ExS-3, which begins below and continues through page ES-14, depicts the MCAC policy
recommendations and the associated GHG reductions and costs/savings for each sector.
Note: The numbering used to denote the policy recommendation in Table ExS-3 and in other
parts of this report is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect prioritization among these
important recommendations. Negative numbers indicate cost savings.

is estimated that a significant fraction of the reductions will occur out of state. In-state reductions refer only to those
occurring from reduced landfilling and waste combustion (these are broken out separately in the table above).
†

The reductions from AFW-5B (Retention of Lands in Conservation Programs) have been left out of the sector totals,
since they relate to a soil carbon protection measure where the estimated emissions (from conservation acres being
returned to active cultivation) are not included in the business as usual (BAU) inventory and forecast (I&F). The costs
have been included in the sector totals, since these will be incurred in order to retain the level of emissions in the
BAU I&F. For AFW-5, AFW-7, and AFW-9, these include the reductions that are expected to occur within the state.

As explained previously, the MCAC considered the estimates of the GHG reductions that could
be achieved and the costs (or cost savings) for the 33 options that were quantifiable. Figure ExS5, below, presents the estimated tons of GHG emission reductions for each of these policy
recommendations, expressed as a cumulative figure for the period 2009–2025.
Figure ExS-6 presents the estimated dollars-per-ton cost (or cost savings, depicted as a negative

estimating exact costs (or cost savings) per ton of reductions achieved for the time periods of this

Figure ExS-7, below, presents a stepwise marginal cost curve for Michigan. The horizontal axis
represents the percentage of GHG emissions reduction in 2025 for each option relative to the
business as usual (BAU) forecast. The vertical axis represents the marginal cost of mitigation
(expressed as the cost-effectiveness of each policy option on a cumulative basis, 2009-2025). In
the figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual policy. The width of the segment
indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the option in percentage terms. The height of
the segment relative to the horizontal x-axis shows the average cost (saving) of reducing one
MMtCO2e of GHG emissions through implementation of the option. For instance, for RCI-2Energy Efficiency- this policy recommendation should result in approximately a 54 MMTCO2e
(19%) reduction of GHG emissions in 2025 below the BAU reference case with an average cost
savings of approximately $28/ton.

Chapter 1
Background and Overview
Creation of the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC)
On November 14, 2007, Governor Jennifer M. Granholm signed Executive Order 2007-42
establishing the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC). The purpose of the MCAC is to
assist Michigan in identifying the best opportunities to mitigate and adapt to climate change,
reduce costs associated with climate change activities, and foster economic growth in Michigan.
Governor Granholm charged the advisory group to:
•
•
•

•

Produce an inventory and forecast of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) sources and emissions from
1990-2020.
Consider potential state and multi-state actions to mitigate and adapt to climate change in
various sectors including energy supply, residential, commercial and industrial,
transportation, land use, agriculture, forestry, and waste management.
Compile a comprehensive climate action plan with specific goals and recommendations
for reducing GHG emissions in Michigan by state and local units of government,
businesses, and Michigan residents to minimize climate change and better prepare for the
effects of climate change in Michigan.
Advise state and local government on measures to address climate change.

MCAC’s Response
In fulfillment of the requirements of this Executive Order, the MCAC held eight meetings over
the last fifteen months. Additionally, the Council formed six Technical Work Groups (TWGs) to
assist the MCAC in formulating options. These TWGs met numerous times between the MCAC
meetings. The MCAC developed this Climate Action Plan as an initial step in establishing a
basis for moving forward on the implementation of climate change policies in Michigan.
Evaluation of key factors such as cost effectiveness, economic impacts, and harmonization with
other Michigan programs and policies will be critical to the next stage of climate policy
implementation.
The following key elements and recommendations were identified by the MCAC during this
initial process:
•

MCAC reviewed over 330 multi-sector policy options and approved for inclusion in this
report a package of 54 policy recommendations to reduce GHG emissions and address
related energy and commerce issues in Michigan. 52 of these 54 recommendations were
approved unanimously and only one option was rejected. The recommended policy
options cover a wide range of costs and GHG reduction potentials.

•

In moving towards implementation to achieve these goals, Michigan should prioritize
these 54 policy recommendations during 2009 in order to set the stage for strategic
implementation of the most promising options. The prioritization should take into

1-1

account the GHG reduction potential, costs and savings, feasibility, co-benefits, a macroeconomic analysis of the selected recommendations, public health and safety and
consistency with other Michigan programs and policies.
•

The MCAC approved policy recommendations are estimated to generate a net cumulative
savings of about $10 billion between 2009 and 2025. The weighted-average costeffectiveness of these policies is estimated to be approximately a $10.2/ tCO2e cost
savings. Those policy options that show negative costs 1 (i.e. benefits) should be
evaluated as quickly as possible, for implementation. All policy options, particularly
those that show a net cost, should be evaluated thoroughly, using tools such as regional
economic modeling, before being implemented.

•

The MCAC recommends periodic review of Michigan’s progress with appropriate
adjustments made in the Climate Action Plan to assure the approaches taken and GHG
reductions are on target. Michigan’s GHG Inventory and Forecast has been prepared
which outlines historical conditions for 1990-2005 and projected emissions through 2025
based upon a business as usual scenario. These documents were completed prior to the
severe downturn in the global economy. To account for fluctuations such as changes in
the economy, updates to this inventory should be performed annually with the projections
evaluated every three years.

•

The MCAC recommends that Michigan further analyze actions needed for adaptation.
The MCAC was unable to examine the impacts of climate change on Michigan’s natural
resources and the Great Lakes due to time and resource constraints. Therefore, the
MCAC recommends that Michigan conduct additional analyses of the state’s
vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and develop specific adaptation plans for
key sectors.

•

MCAC recommends that Michigan position itself as a leader in the national and regional
dialogue on climate change policy as described in the MCAC Recommended Policy
Positions section.

Recent Actions
GHG Reductions Associated With Recent Federal and State Actions
The MCAC identified recent actions undertaken in Michigan that will reduce GHG emissions
while conserving energy and promoting the development and use of renewable energy sources.
One such action was the adoption of Public Act (PA) 295 2 . The resultant emission reductions
were estimated. Reductions associated with federal actions, such as the federal Energy
Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 and the implementation of the Act’s Corporate
Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) requirements, were also estimated. A total reduction of about

Policy options that are “negative cost” are not necessarily better than other potential investments. In capital
constrained situations only a limited number of investments can be made. There may be structural or policy barriers
to the adoption of options identified as negative cost.

The MCAC Process
The MCAC began its deliberative process at its first meeting on December 12, 2007. MCAC met
in person a total of seven times, with the final decisional meeting held on January 28, 2009. A
teleconference meeting was held on February 26, 2009 exclusively for the review of this report.
An additional 74 teleconference meetings of MCAC’s six supporting Technical Work Groups
were also held to identify and analyze various potential policy actions in advance of the MCAC’s
January 28, 2009 final decisional meeting.
The six TWGs considered information and potential options in the following sectors:
•

Energy Supply(ES);

•

Market Based Policies (MBP);

•

Residential, Commercial and Industrial (RCI);

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW); and

•

Cross-Cutting Issues (CCI) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) provided facilitation and technical assistance to the
MCAC and each of the TWGs, based on a detailed proposal approved by the MDEQ. The TWGs
served as advisors to the MCAC and consisted of MCAC members and additional individuals
with interest and expertise. Members of the public were invited to observe and provide input at
all meetings of the MCAC and TWGs. The TWGs assisted the MCAC by generating initial
options on Michigan-specific policy options to be added to the catalog of existing states actions;
Where members of a TWG did not fully agree on the recommendations to the MCAC, the
summary of their efforts was reported to the MCAC as a part of its consideration and actions.
The MCAC reviewed the TWGs’ proposals, modified the proposals, if necessary, and made final
decisions on the items before them.
The MCAC process employed a model of informed self-determination through a facilitated,
stepwise, fact-based, and consensus-building approach. As noted, the process was facilitated by
the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS), an independent, expert facilitation and technical
analysis team. It was based on procedures that CCS has used in a number of other state climate
change planning initiatives since 2000, but was adapted specifically for Michigan. The MCAC
process sought but did not mandate consensus, and it explicitly documented the level of MCAC
support for policies and key findings through a voting process established in advance, including
barriers to full consensus where they existed on final consideration of proposed actions.
The 54 policy recommendations (out of more than 330 potential options considered) adopted by
the MCAC and presented in this report were developed through a stepwise approach that
included: (1) expanding a list of existing states actions to include additional Michigan-specific
actions; (2) developing a set of “priority for analysis” options for further development; (3)
fleshing these proposals out for full analysis by development of “straw proposals” for level of
effort, timing and parties involved in implementation; (4) developing and applying a common
framework of analysis for options, including sector-specific guidance and detailed specifications
for options that include data sources, methods and key assumptions; (5) reviewing results of
1-4

analysis and modifying proposals as needed to address potential barriers to consensus; (6)
finalizing design and analysis of options to remove barriers to final agreement; and (7)
developing other key elements of policy proposals such as implementation mechanisms, cobenefits, and feasibility considerations. At Meetings # 6 and 7, policy recommendations
receiving unanimous support, a super majority or majority support (defined as less than half of
those present objecting) from the MCAC members present were adopted by the MCAC and
included in this report. The TWGs’ options to the MCAC were documented and presented at
each MCAC meeting. All of the MCAC and TWG meetings were open to the public and all
materials for and summaries of the MCAC and TWG meetings were posted on the MCAC Web
site (www.miclimatechange.us). A detailed description of the deliberative process is included in
Appendix B.

Analysis of Policy Recommendations
With CCS providing facilitation and technical analysis, the six TWGs submitted policy
recommendations for MCAC consideration using a “policy option template” conveying the
following key information:
Policy Description
Policy Design (Goals, Timing, Parties Involved)
Implementation Mechanisms
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Key Uncertainties
Additional Benefits and Costs
Feasibility Issues
Status of Group Approval
Level of Group Support
Barriers to Consensus
In its deliberations, the MCAC reviewed, modified, and reached group agreement on various
policy recommendations. The final versions for each sector, conforming to the policy
recommendation templates, appear in Appendices F through K and constitute the most detailed
record of decisions of the MCAC. Appendix E describes the methods used for quantification of
the 33 policy options that were analyzed quantitatively. The quantitative analysis produced
estimates of the GHG emission reductions and direct net costs (or cost savings) of
implementation of various policies, in terms of both a net present value from 2009 to 2025 and a
dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness). The key methods are summarized below.
Estimates of GHG Reductions: Using the projection of future GHG emissions (see below) as a
starting point, 33 policy options were analyzed by CCS to estimate GHG reductions attributable
to each policy in the individual years of 2015 and 2025 and cumulative reductions over the
period 2009–2025. The years 2015 and 2025 were chosen as the target years for quantification

1-5

and analysis as part of the MCAC Interim Report to the Governor, in April 2008. 3 The estimates
were prepared in accordance with guidance by the appropriate TWG and the MCAC, which later
reviewed the estimates and, in some cases, directed that they be revised with respect to such
elements as goals, data sources, assumptions, sensitivity analysis, and methodology. Some
policies were estimated to affect the quantity or type of fossil fuel combusted. Other policies
affected methane or carbon dioxide (CO2) being sequestered. Sequestered means the gas is
stored in plant materials or geologic formations so it is not contributing to global warming.
Among the many assumptions involved in this task was identification of the appropriate GHG
accounting framework—namely, the choice between taking a “production-based” approach
versus a “consumption-based” approach to various sectors of the economy. 4
Estimates of Costs/Cost Savings: The analyses of 33 policy recommendations included
estimates of the direct cost of those policies, in terms of both net costs or cost savings during
2009–2025 and a dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness). Following is a brief summary of
the approach used to estimate the costs or cost savings associated with the policy
recommendations:
•

Discounted and annualized costs or cost savings—Standard approaches were taken here. The
net present value of costs or cost savings was calculated by applying a real discount rate of
5%. Dollars-per-ton estimates were derived as an annualized cost per ton, dividing the
present value cost or savings by the cumulative GHG reduction measured in tons. As was the
case with GHG reductions, the period 2009–2025 was analyzed.

•

Cost savings— Total net costs or savings were estimated through comparison of monetized
costs and savings of policy implementation over time, using discounting. These net costs
could be positive or negative. Negative costs indicated that the policy saved money or
produced “cost savings.” Many policies were estimated to create net financial cost savings
(typically through fuel savings and electricity savings associated with new policy actions).

•

Direct vs. indirect effects—Estimates of costs and cost savings were based on “direct effects”
(i.e., those borne by the entities implementing the policy). 5 Implementing entities could be
individuals, companies, and/or government agencies. In contrast, conventional cost-benefit
analysis takes the “societal perspective” and tallies every conceivable impact on every entity
in society (and quantifies these wherever possible).

Additional Costs and Benefits: The MCAC options were guided by four decision criteria that
included GHG reductions and monetized costs and cost savings of various policies, as well as
other potential co-benefits and costs (e.g., social, economic, and environmental) and feasibility
2

“MCAC Interim Report to the Governor,” April 30, 2008

3

A production-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services produced within the
state, and a consumption-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services consumed
within the state. In some sectors of the economy, these two approaches may not result in significantly different
numbers. However, the power sector is notable, in that it is responsible for large quantities of GHG emissions, and
states often produce more or less electricity than they consume (with the remainder attributable to power exports or
imports).

4

“Additional benefits and costs” were defined as those borne by entities other than those implementing the policy
option. These indirect effects were quantified on a case-by-case basis, depending on magnitude, importance, need,
and availability of data.

1-6

considerations. The TWGs were asked to examine the latter two in qualitative terms where
deemed important and quantify them on a case-by-case basis, as needed, depending on need and
where data were readily available. It should be noted that some of these un-quantified co-benefits
and costs could be quite significant and merit further investigation.
Implementation Mechanisms: The analysis for each option (see Appendices F through K) of
the MCAC includes guidance on the policy instruments or “mechanisms” that were prescribed or
assumed for the policy action. This includes a range of potential mechanisms including, for
instance, funding incentives, codes and standards, voluntary and negotiated agreements, market
based instruments, information and education, reporting and disclosure, and other instruments. In
some cases, the recommended instruments are precise. In other cases, they are more general and
envision further work to develop concrete programs and steps to achieve the goals recommended
by the MCAC.

Michigan GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared the Michigan Inventory and Forecast Report 6
for the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The report presents an
assessment of the State’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon
storage) from 1990 to 2025. The preliminary draft inventory and forecast estimates in January
2008 served as a starting point for the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) and Technical
Work Groups (TWGs). The MCAC and TWGs reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft
inventory and methodologies and offered alternative data and approaches for improving the draft
GHG inventory and forecast. The inventory and forecast were revised to address the comments
received. The final Inventory and Forecast Report was approved by the MCAC at the November
2008 meeting and is available at:
http://www.miclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm .
The inventory and projections cover the six types of gases included in the United States (US)
Greenhouse Gas Inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions
of these GHGs are presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates
the relative contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a
global warming potential- (GWP-) weighted basis.7
The inventory and reference case projections included detailed coverage of all economic sectors
and GHGs in Michigan, including future emission trends and assessment issues related to
energy, the economy, and population growth. It is important to note that the emission estimates

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system (IPCC, 2001). Holding everything else
constant, increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net
increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth), See: Boucher, O., et al. “Radiative Forcing of Climate Change.”

reflect the GHG emissions associated with the electricity sources used to meet Michigan’s
demands, corresponding to a consumption-based approach to emissions accounting. Another way
to look at electricity emissions is to consider the GHG emissions produced by electricity
generation facilities in the state—a production-based method. The study covers both methods of
accounting for emissions, but for consistency, all total results are reported as consumption-based.
As illustrated in Figure 1-2, activities in Michigan accounted for approximately 248 million
metric tons (MMt) of gross 8 CO2e emissions (consumption basis) in 2005, an amount equal to
about 3.5% of total US gross GHG emissions (based on 2005 US data). 9 Gross emissions
exclude carbon sinks, such as forests. Michigan’s gross GHG emissions are rising slower than
those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005, Michigan’s gross GHG emissions increased
by about 12%, while national emissions rose by 16%. The growth in Michigan’s emissions from
1990 to 2005 is primarily associated with the electricity consumption and transportation sectors.
The principal sources of Michigan’s GHG emissions are electricity consumption; residential,
commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use; and transportation accounting for 36, 24, and 24% of
Michigan’s gross GHG emissions in 2005, respectively.
As illustrated in Figure 1-2, below, under the reference case projections, Michigan’s gross GHG
emissions continue to grow, and are projected to climb to about 292 MMtCO2e by 2025,
reaching 32% above 1990 levels. While these projections are made over the long term (e.g. to
2025), they do not account for the current severe global economic downturn and how this will
impact future growth projections.
Emissions associated with electricity consumption are projected to be the largest contributor to
future GHG emissions growth, followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector.
Other sources of emissions growth include the RCI fuel use sector and the increasing use of
HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in refrigeration, air conditioning,
and other applications. The agriculture sector is the only sector in which emissions are projected
to decrease from 2005 to 2025. Figure 1-3 depicts the 2005 distribution of sources in Michigan
compared to the US.

The national emissions used for these comparisons are based on 2005 emissions from Inventory of US Greenhouse
Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2006, April 15, 2008, US EPA #430-R-08-005,
(http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html).

MCAC Policy Recommendations (Beyond Recent Actions)
The MCAC approved 54 policy recommendations for consideration of further action in
Michigan. Of these, 33 were analyzed quantitatively to calculate both emission reductions and

1-9

costs or savings. Based on this analysis, the 33 quantified policies have the cumulative effect of
reducing annual GHG emissions by approximately 41 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2015 and by 117 MMtCO2e in 2025. The additional policy
recommendations were not quantifiable but are considered valuable recommendations to support
the overall Climate Action Plan. Several of the non-quantified policy recommendations may
have the potential to achieve GHG emission reductions.
Figure 1-4 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the 33 policy options and federal actions relative to the business-as-usual
reference case projections.
•

The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
2020 and 2025) levels of Michigan’s gross GHG emissions on a business as usual basis.
This consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Michigan to meet the state’s demand for electricity.

•

The red line shows the projected emissions adjusted for the recent state and federal actions
described in Table 1.1.

•

The green line shows the projected emissions if all of the MCAC’s 33 recommended options
are implemented and the estimated reductions are fully achieved. While the other MCAC
options have the effect of reducing emissions, those reductions were not quantified and are
not reflected in the green line.

It is important to note, to yield these emission reductions from the 33 MCAC recommended
options, implementation must be timely, aggressive, and thorough. Evaluation of key factors
such as cost effectiveness, economic impacts, and harmonization with other Michigan programs
and policies will be critical to the next stage of climate policy implementation.

Table 1-2 provides the numeric estimates underlying Figure 1-4. In summary, if all of the Policy
recommendations are fully implemented and successful in achieving all of the GHG reductions
projected then MI should over-achieve its GHG reduction goals by 7.3 MMtCO2e in 2020.
Another way to look at this is that the MCAC package of policy recommendations entails a
surplus of GHG reductions of about 7.3MMTCO2e.

Table 1-3 depicts the final policy recommendations of the Council and their associated GHG
reductions and costs or savings for each sector.
In Table 1-3 and throughout the Climate Action Plan, negative cost (- $) figures indicate cost
savings. For example, in Table 1-3 the column totals for the Net Present Value (NPV) of ($10,093 million) portrays a cost savings of $10,093,000,000 over the 2009- 2025 period of
analysis.

Negative values in the Net Present Value and the Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings associated
with the policy options.
Within each sector, values have been adjusted to eliminate double counting for policies or elements of policies that
overlap. In addition, values associated with policies or elements of policies within a sector that overlap with policies or
elements of policies in another sector have been adjusted to eliminate double counting. Appendix F (for the ES
sectors), Appendix H (for the RCI sectors), Appendix I (for the TLU sectors), and Appendix J (for the AFW sectors) of
this report provide documentation of how sector-level emission reductions and costs (or cost savings) were adjusted
to eliminate double counting associated with overlaps between policies.

Note that negative costs represent a monetary savings.
* The quantification results for AFW-2 (biofuel production volumes and costs) were used as inputs to the
quantification of the results of TLU-1, which covers consumption of biofuels in Michigan.
** The analyses for AFW-5, AFW-7, and AFW-9 include the full life-cycle costs of the policies. In the case of AFW-9, it
is estimated that a significant fraction of the reductions will occur out of state. In-state reductions refer only to those
occurring from reduced landfilling and waste combustion (these are broken out separately in the table above).
†
The reductions from AFW-5B (Retention of Lands in Conservation Programs) have been left out of the sector totals,
since they relate to a soil carbon protection measure where the estimated emissions (from conservation acres being

have been included in the sector totals, since these will be incurred in order to retain the level of emissions in the
BAU I&F. For AFW-5, AFW-7, and AFW-9, these include the reductions that are expected to occur within the state.

Perspectives on Policy Options
As explained previously, the MCAC considered the estimates of the GHG reductions that could
be achieved and the costs (or cost savings) for the 33 options that were quantifiable. Figure 1-5,
below, presents the estimated tons of GHG emission reductions for each of these policy
recommendations, expressed as a cumulative figure for the period 2009–2025.
Figure 1-6 presents the estimated dollars-per-ton cost (or cost savings, depicted as a negative
number) for each quantified policy recommendation. The dollars per ton value is calculated by

1-19

dividing the net present value of the cost of the policy recommendation by the cumulative GHG
reductions, all for the period 2009–2025.
It is important to note that there is some level of uncertainty in projecting GHG reductions and
estimating exact costs (or cost savings) per ton of reductions achieved for the time periods of this
analysis.

Figure 1-7, below, presents a stepwise marginal cost curve for Michigan. The horizontal axis
represents the percentage of GHG emissions reduction in 2025 for each option relative to the
business as usual (BAU) forecast. The vertical axis represents the marginal cost of mitigation
(expressed as the cost-effectiveness of each policy option on a cumulative basis, 2009-2025). In
the figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual policy. The width of the segment
indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the option in percentage terms. The height of
the segment relative to the x-axis shows the average cost (saving) of reducing one MMtCO2e of
GHG emissions with the application of the option. For instance, for RCI-2-Energy Efficiencythis policy recommendation should result in approximately a 54 MMTCO2e (19%) reduction of
GHG emissions in 2025 below the BAU reference case with an average cost savings of
approximately $28/ton.

Chapter 2
Inventory and Projections of Michigan's GHG Emissions
Introduction
This chapter summarizes Michigan’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks (carbon
storage) from 1990 to 2025. The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared a draft of
Michigan’s GHG emissions inventory and reference case projections for the Michigan
Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The draft inventory and reference case
projections, completed in January 2008, provided the MDEQ with an initial, comprehensive
understanding of current and possible future GHG emissions. The draft report was provided to
the Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) and its Technical Work Groups (TWGs) to assist
them in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG emissions in Michigan, and
thereby inform the policy recommendation development process. The MCAC and TWGs have
reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and methodologies, as well as alternative
data and approaches for improving the draft GHG inventory and forecast. The inventory and
forecast have since been revised to address the comments provided by the MCAC. The
information in this chapter reflects the information presented in the final Michigan Greenhouse
Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections report (hereafter referred to as the Inventory and
Projections report). 1
Historical GHG emission estimates (1990 through 2005) 2 were developed using a set of
generally accepted principles and guidelines for state GHG emission inventories, relying to the
extent possible on Michigan-specific data and inputs. The reference case projections (20062025) are based on a compilation of various existing projections of electricity generation, fuel
use, and other GHG-emitting activities, along with a set of simple, transparent assumptions
described in the final Inventory and Projections report.
The Inventory and Projections report covers the six types of gases included in the U.S. GHG
inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential-weighted basis. 3

2025. Prepared for the Michigan Climate Action Council. November 2008.

The last year of available historical data for each sector varies between 2000 and 2005. The University of
Michigan also prepared an inventory and forecast of GHG emissions in conjunction with the MDEQ in 2005.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth–atmosphere system. Holding everything else constant,
increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the
absorption of energy by the Earth). See: Boucher, O., et al. "Radiative Forcing of Climate Change." Chapter 6 in
Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Contribution of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on

It is important to note that the emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with the
electricity sources used to meet Michigan’s demands, corresponding to a consumption-based
approach to emissions accounting. Another way to look at electricity emissions is to consider the
GHG emissions produced by electricity generation facilities in the state, a production-based
method. The study covers both methods of accounting for emissions, but for consistency, all total
results are reported as consumption-based.

Michigan GHG Emissions: Sources and Trends
Table 2-1 provides a summary of GHG emissions estimated for Michigan by sector for 1990, 2000,
2005, 2010, 2020, and 2025. As shown in this table, Michigan is estimated to be a net source of
GHG emissions (positive, or gross, emissions). Michigan’s forests serve as sinks of GHG emissions
(removal of emissions, or negative emissions). Michigan’s net emissions subtract the equivalent
GHG reduction from emission sinks from the gross GHG emission totals. The following sections
discuss GHG emission sources and sinks, trends, projections, and uncertainties.

Historical Emissions
Overview
In 2005, on a gross emissions consumption basis (i.e., excluding carbon sinks), Michigan
accounted for approximately 248 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2e emissions, an amount equal
to 3.5% of total U.S. gross GHG emissions. On a net emissions basis (i.e., including carbon
sinks), Michigan residents accounted for approximately 235 MMtCO2e of emissions in 2005, an
amount equal to 3.8% of total U.S. net GHG emissions.4 Michigan’s GHG emissions are rising
slower than those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005, Michigan’s gross GHG emissions
increased by 12%, while national gross emissions rose by 16%. 5
On a per-capita basis, Michigan residents emitted about 24 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 2005,
similar to the national average of about 24 tCO2e. Figure 2-1 illustrates the state’s emissions per
capita and per unit of economic output. Both Michigan and national per-capita emissions
remained nearly constant from 1990 to 2005. This consistency in per-capita emission rates in
Michigan results from growth in emissions from the electricity supply and transportation sectors,
and decline in emissions from the industrial fuel use and industrial processes sectors. In both
Michigan and the nation as a whole, economic growth exceeded emissions growth throughout
the 1990 – 2005 period. From 1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 26%
nationally, and by 23% in Michigan. 6

During this period, population grew by 10% in Michigan and by 19% nationally. However, Michigan’s economy
grew at the same rate as the nation on a per-capita basis (up 32%).

The principal sources of Michigan’s GHG emissions in 2005 are electricity consumption,
residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use, and transportation, accounting for 36%,
24%, and 24% of Michigan’s gross GHG emissions, respectively, as shown in Figure 2-2. The
next largest contributor is the industrial processes sector, accounting for 7% of gross GHG
emissions in 2005; these emissions are rising due to the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as
substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons. 7 Other industrial process emissions include
7

Chlorofluorocarbons are also potent GHGs; however, they are not included in GHG estimates because of concerns
related to implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Affect the Ozone Layer. See Appendix I in
the Final Inventory and Projections report for Michigan (http://www.miclimatechange.us/stakeholder.cfm).

CO2 released by cement and lime manufacturing; CO2 released during soda ash, limestone, and
dolomite use; CO2 released during taconite production and iron and steel production; SF6
released during magnesium production and from transformers used in electricity transmission
and distribution systems; and HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 released during semiconductor
manufacturing.
Figure 2-2 also shows that the agricultural and forest wildfire sectors together accounted for 3%
of the gross GHG emissions in Michigan in 2005. These CH4 and N2O emissions primarily come
from agricultural soils, enteric fermentation, manure management, and agricultural soil
cultivation practices. Also, landfills and wastewater management facilities produce CH4 and N2O
emissions that accounted for 3% of total gross GHG emissions in Michigan in 2005. Similarly,
emissions associated with the production, processing, transmission, and distribution of fossil
fuels accounted for 3% of the gross GHG emissions in 2005.

Notes: Res/Com = Residential and commercial fuel use sectors. Emissions for the residential, commercial, and
industrial fuel use sectors are associated with the direct use of fuels (natural gas, petroleum, coal, and wood) to
provide space heating, water heating, process heating, cooking, and other energy end-uses. The commercial sector
accounts for emissions associated with the direct use of fuels by, for example, hospitals, schools, government
buildings (local, county, and state) and other commercial establishments. The industrial processes sector accounts
for emissions associated with manufacturing and excludes emissions included in the industrial fuel use sector. The
transportation sector accounts for emissions associated with fuel consumption by all on-road and non-highway
vehicles. Non-highway vehicles include jet aircraft, gasoline-fueled piston aircraft, railway locomotives, boats, and
ships. Emissions from non-highway agricultural and construction equipment are included in the industrial sector.
Electricity = Electricity generation sector emissions on a consumption basis, including emissions associated with
electricity imported from outside of Michigan and excluding emissions associated with electricity exported from
Michigan to other states.

Forestry emissions refer to the net CO2 flux 8 from forested lands in Michigan, which account for
about 53% of the state’s land area. 9 Michigan’s forests are estimated to be net sinks of CO2
emissions in the state, reducing net GHG emissions by 13 MMtCO2e in 2005.

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Reference Case Projections
Relying on a variety of sources for projections, as noted in the Inventory and Projections report,
a simple reference case projection of GHG emissions through 2025 was developed. As illustrated
in Figure 2-3 and shown numerically in Table 2-1, under the reference case projections,
Michigan’s gross GHG emissions continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 292 MMtCO2e by
2025, or 32% above 1990 levels. This equates to a 0.8% annual rate of growth from 1990 to
2025. Relative to 2005, the share of emissions associated with electricity consumption and
industrial processes both increase slightly to 38% and 9%, respectively, by 2025. The share of
emissions from the transportation, RCI fuel use, and agriculture sectors all decrease slightly to
22%, 21%, and 2%, respectively. The emissions from the fossil fuel industries and the waste
sector remain the same in 2025 as their shares in 2005.

A Closer Look at the Three Major Sources: Electricity Supply, RCI Fuel Use, and
Transportation
As shown in Figure 2-2, electricity use in 2005 accounted for 36% of Michigan’s gross GHG
emissions (about 90 MMtCO2e), which was higher than the national average share of emissions
from electricity consumption (32%).10 On a per-capita basis, Michigan’s GHG emissions from
electricity consumption are higher than the national average (in 2005, 8.8 tCO2e per capita in
Michigan, versus 8.1 tCO2e per capita nationally). Electricity generation in Michigan is
dominated by steam units, which are primarily powered by coal and nuclear fuel.
In 2005, emissions associated with Michigan’s electricity consumption (90 MMtCO2e) were
about 19 MMtCO2e higher than those associated with electricity production (71 MMtCO2e). The
higher level for consumption-based emissions reflects GHG emissions associated with net
imports of electricity from other states to meet electricity demand. 11 Projections of electricity
sales for 2005–2025 indicate that Michigan will remain a net importer of electricity. Emissions
from electricity imports are projected to be constant (19 MMtCO2e/yr) during the 2006–2025
period. The reference case projection indicates that production-based emissions (associated with
electricity generated in-state) will increase by about 21 MMtCO2e, and consumption-based
emissions (associated with electricity consumed in-state) will also increase by about 21
MMtCO2e from 2005 to 2025.
While estimates are provided for emissions from both electricity production and consumption,
unless otherwise indicated, tables, figures, and totals in this report reflect electricity consumption
emissions. The consumption-based approach can better reflect the emissions (and emission
reductions) associated with activities occurring in the state, particularly with respect to electricity
use (and efficiency improvements), and is particularly useful for decision making. Under this
approach, emissions associated with electricity exported to other states would need to be covered
in those states’ inventories in order to avoid double counting or exclusions.
Activities in the RCI 12 sectors produce GHG emissions when fuels are combusted to provide
space heating, process heating, and other applications. From 1990 to 2005, emissions from RCI
decreased at an annual rate of 0.8%, largely due to the decrease in industrial fuel use. In 2005,
combustion of oil, natural gas, coal, and wood in the RCI sectors contributed about 24% (about
60 MMtCO2e) of Michigan’s gross GHG emissions, slightly higher than the RCI sector
contribution for the nation (22%).
10

For the United States as a whole, there is relatively little difference between the emissions from electricity use and
emissions from electricity production, as the US imports only about 1% of its electricity, and exports even less.

11

Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in-state and out-of-state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimate reflects some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A of the Inventory and Projections report.
12

The industrial sector includes emissions associated with agricultural energy use and fuel used by the fossil fuel
production industry.

2-8

In 2005, the residential sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 39% (23.6
MMtCO2e), the commercial sector accounted for 18% (11 MMtCO2e), and the industrial sector’s
share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 42% (25 MMtCO2e). Overall, emissions
for the RCI sectors (excluding those associated with electricity consumption) are expected to
increase by 4.1% between 2005 and 2025. Emissions from the commercial sector are projected to
increase more rapidly than the residential or industrial sectors, with an 18% increase from 2005
to 2025. In contrast, emissions from the residential and industrial sectors are expected to increase
by only 0.5% and 1.6%, respectively, during the same period.
Like electricity emissions, GHG emissions from transportation fuel use rose steadily from 1990
to 2005, at an average annual growth rate of 1.1%. In 2005, gasoline-powered on-road vehicles
accounted for about 74% of transportation GHG emissions; on-road diesel vehicles for 18%;
marine vessels for 4%; aviation fuels, rail and other sources (natural gas- and liquefied petroleum
gas-fueled vehicles used in transport applications) for the remaining 4%. As a result of
Michigan’s population and economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles traveled,
emissions from on-road gasoline use grew at a rate of 0.98% annually between 1990 and 2005.
Meanwhile, emissions from on-road diesel use rose by 4.6% per year from 1990 to 2005,
suggesting an even more rapid growth in freight movement within or across the state. Emissions
from on-road gasoline vehicles in 2025 are projected to increase by 0.35% annually from 2005
levels, and emissions from on-road diesel vehicles are projected to increase by 1.5% annually
from 2005 to 2025, with total transportation emissions expected to reach 65 MMtCO2e by 2025.

MCAC Revisions
The following identifies the revisions that the MCAC made to the inventory and reference case
projections, thus explaining the differences between the final Inventory and Projections report
and the initial assessment completed in January 2008:
All Sectors: The initial assessment included GHG emission projections to 2020. This was revised
to extend the GHG projections to 2025 for all sectors.
Electric Supply:
•

Production-based (in-state) and consumption-based generation and emissions:
Excluded electricity that Donald Cook nuclear plant exports to other states.
○ Replaced this nuclear generation with electricity imports from outside the state.
○

•

Emissions from pumped storage:
○

•

Set emissions to zero to avoid double counting of emissions (pumps are operated by
electricity purchased from grid),

Landfill gas (LFG)/municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass emissions:
Added emissions for 1990–2000 (data for non-utilities inadvertently not included in the
draft inventory and forecast).
○ For 1990–2000, only the aggregated non-utility generation (generation from independent
power producers) can be obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
○

2-9

Web site (EIA Electric Power Annual 2006). To get the disaggregated generation of
LFG, MSW, and biomass for 1990–2000 from the aggregated Other Renewable
Generation number in Electric Power Annual (this number excludes hydro electricity),
we applied the proportions by fuel and by plant type in 2001 to the aggregated renewable
numbers of 1990–2000.
•

Transmission & distribution (T&D) line losses of Michigan:
○

•

The T&D line losses used in the draft analysis were revised based on the data provided
by the Michigan Public Service Commission. The T&D loss rate of Consumers
Energy/METC, Detroit Edison/ITC, and Upper Peninsula were collected. The weightedaverage T&D loss rate of Michigan was computed based on the 2007 peak load on the
system in each of the three regions

Forecast for biomass net generation:
○

The forecast of biomass in the draft inventory and forecast used EIA regional projections,
which show big increases in biomass generation in the forecast years. The EIA regional
projections could be influenced by the existing renewable portfolio standard (RPS) in
other states of the region. The electricity generation from biomass has been flat over the
past 10 years or so in Michigan, about 1% of the total generation of the state. Biomass
generation would be unlikely to significantly increase in Michigan in the forecast years
unless there are strong policy regulations, such as an RPS. Therefore, in this report, for
the business-as-usual condition in the forecast years, we assumed the same generation
capacity from biomass as the existing capacity indicates (an average level of 2001–2005).

Transportation: MCAC approved the use of a new set of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) growth
rates (for 2005–2010, 2010–2015, 2015–2020, and 2020–2025), provided by the Michigan
Department of Transportation; this replaces the previous VMT growth rates used in the draft
inventory and forecast.
Industrial Process: The MCAC revised iron and steel emissions by replacing the default State
Inventory Tool (SIT) steel production data with crude steel production data provided by MDEQ
for 1990–2005.
Fossil Fuel Industry: The MCAC added new estimates of the CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions from
the combustion of natural gas by internal combustion engines used to operate pipeline
compressor stations. These emissions were not included in the initial assessment. These pipeline
natural gas fuel use emissions were estimated using SIT emission factors and Michigan 1990–
2005 natural gas data from EIA.
Agriculture: Projections for livestock populations were revised based on feedback from the
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste TWG. Projections for beef cattle, swine, sheep, goats, and
horses were estimated based on logarithmic forecasts of the historical 1990–2005 populations.
Poultry populations were held at 2005 levels based on input from the poultry industry. 13

2-10

Waste Sector: In the initial assessment, CH4 captured for flaring and use in landfill gas to energy
(LFGTE) plants were estimated with SIT defaults. The revised estimates are based on waste
emplacement data for controlled landfills and date of emission capture equipment installation.
Information on controlled landfills was obtained from MDEQ and a database of LFGTE projects
compiled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Open burning of MSW at residential sites was not estimated in the initial assessment. The
revised report includes these emissions, which were obtained from EPA’s 2002 National
Emissions Inventory for estimates of the quantity of waste burned at residential sites in
Michigan. 14
Forestry: CO2 flux estimates for 1994–2005 were revised to be based on the average calculated
flux during this period using the Carbon Calculation Tool. This was done to minimize the
influence of estimates in individual years and shifts between U.S. Forest Service Forest
Inventory and Analysis (FIA) measurements.

Key Uncertainties
Some data gaps exist in this inventory, particularly in the reference case projections. Key tasks
for future refinement of this inventory and forecast include review and revision of key drivers,
such as the transportation, electricity demand, and RCI fuel use growth rates that will be major
determinants of Michigan’s future GHG emissions (see Table 2-2 and Figure 2-4). These growth
rates are driven by uncertain economic, demographic, and land-use trends (including growth
patterns and transportation system impacts), all of which deserve closer review and discussion.

Chapter 3
Energy Supply Sector
Overview of GHG Emissions
The energy supply (ES) sector includes greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the production,
processing, transmission, and storage of electricity and fossil fuels. Electricity generation
accounts for the vast majority of these emissions, representing 93% of Michigan’s total ES sector
emissions in 2005. Nearly all of the remainder comes from the production, processing,
transmission, and distribution of natural gas. GHG emissions from the ES sector represented
45% of Michigan’s total consumption-based emissions in 2005.
Michigan has historically been a net importer of electricity. Electricity imports increased from
about 8,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 1990 to about 25,000 GWh in 2000, which is comparable
to total imports in 2005, or 21% of all electricity consumed in Michigan 1 . GHG emissions from
imported electricity represented the same percentage (21%) of total consumption in 2005.
In the absence of any mitigation efforts, GHG emissions from Michigan’s ES sector are expected
to increase from 2005 base year levels of 90 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MMtCO2e) to 111 MMtCO2e in 2025, or about a 23.3% increase. Compared with estimated
current (2009) emissions of 89.5 MMtCO2e, a 26% increase is expected. 2 Projections of future
electricity generation requirements are taken from Michigan’s 21st Century Electric Energy Plan,
prepared by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC). Projections assume electricity
imports throughout the forecast period will remain at 2005 levels, and that in-state and imported
generation fuel mix will also remain unchanged. Figure 3-1 shows historical and projected GHG
emissions from power generation by fuel source.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The biggest challenge facing Michigan’s ES sector is the state’s high reliance on coal-fired
generation, and the age of the coal generation fleet, which is the second oldest in the nation.
GHG emissions from the combustion of coal for the generation of electricity represent 95% of all
electricity emissions, with almost all of the remainder being natural gas. Figure 3-2 shows the
breakdown of in-state gross electricity generation and in-state GHG emissions by fuel type for
2005. Another challenge is increasing demand, which is projected at 1% per year (2005–2025)
and assumed to be fully met through new in-state generation. This rate incorporates the current
demand-side management programs in Michigan.
While the age of Michigan’s coal-burning power generation fleet is a challenge, it is also an
opportunity. Many plants will be candidates for retrofit or replacement within the forecast
period, so the opportunity to move to lower-GHG fuels and advanced coal combustion
technology is substantial. Michigan is blessed with significant wind and biomass generation

Imports are estimated by taking the difference between the total electricity sales in Michigan and the sales from the
in-state power generation. The data sources for the total electricity sales and the sales from in-state sources are EIA

Note: The numbering used to denote the policy recommendation is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect
prioritization among these important recommendations.

These recommendations include efforts to extend and expand Public Act (PA) 295, the Clean,
Renewable and Energy Efficiency Act (ES-1 and ES-3), promote the development and use of
advanced fossil fuel technologies (ES-5 and ES-9), expand the use of nuclear power (ES-6),
promote integrated resource planning and combined heat and power (ES-7 and ES-13), convert
to a "smart grid" (ES-8), advance the use of emerging technologies (ES-10), promote improved
efficiency or replacement of older generating units (ES-11), promote the expanded use of smallscale distributed generation, including renewable energy payments (ES-1 and ES-12), and
improve transmission and distribution system efficiency and access. In addition to the recent
actions contained in PA 295, these policy recommendations contribute to GHG emission
reductions during 2009–2025, as outlined in Table 3-1.
Overall, the ES mitigation recommendations and recent actions yield annual GHG emission
reductions from reference case projections of about 25.5 MMtCO2e in 2025 and cumulative
reductions of 250.4 MMtCO2e from 2009 through 2025, at a net cost of approximately $9 billion
through 2025 on a net present value basis. The weighted-average cost of reduced carbon for the
ES measures is about $36/tCO2e avoided. An overview of each policy recommendation is
provided in this chapter. Additional details regarding the application of these recommendations
to Michigan (targets, implementation mechanisms, parties involved, modeling approach, etc.) are
provided in Appendix F.

Energy Supply Sector Policy Descriptions

The ES sector has several opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions from electricity
generation, including mitigation activities associated with the generation, transmission, and
distribution of electricity—whether generated through the combustion of fossil fuels, renewable
energy sources in a centralized power station supplying the grid, or distributed generation
facilities.
ES-1.

Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)

A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is a requirement that utilities supply a certain amount of
annual retail sales from eligible renewable energy sources by a certain date and each year
thereafter. This recommendation endorses the RPS contained within PA 295 through 2015, and
then adopts the Midwestern Governors Association platform goals from 2015 through 2025.
Beyond reducing utility-sector emissions of CO2, benefits to Michigan would include lower
emissions of smog and soot precursors, improved energy balance of trade, diversified fuel
supply, and economic development potential. Twenty-four states plus the District of Columbia
have adopted some form of an RPS. In the Midwest, these include Illinois (25% by 2025),
Minnesota (27.4% by 2025), Ohio (12.5% by 2025), and Wisconsin (10% by 2015). This policy
assumes that the provisions of ES-12, Distributed Generation (DG), are included here. The DG
policy design in ES-12 is incorporated through a "carve-out," or guarantee, within ES-1 for both
the 2015 and the 2025 goals.
ES-3.

Energy Optimization Standard (EOS)

Energy optimization means energy efficiency, load management that reduces overall energy use,
and related energy conservation. An energy optimization standard (EOS) requires energy savings
as a percentage of total annual retail electricity sales in megawatt-hours and total annual retail
natural gas sales in decatherms or equivalent thousand cubic feet in a specified year. To
accomplish this, electric and natural gas providers are to develop energy optimization plans
sufficient to ensure the achievement of applicable EOSs. In the Midwest, states that have adopted
this policy mechanism include Minnesota (1.5% annual energy savings), Illinois (1% annual
energy savings by 2011, 2% annual energy savings by 2015), and Ohio (1% annual energy
savings by 2014, 2% annual energy savings by 2019). EOS goals mirror requirements under PA
295 through 2012, and then expand and extend the requirements through 2025.
ES-5.

Advanced Fossil Fuel Technology

Advanced fossil fuel-based electric generation technologies include those that can be more
efficient and thus lower emitting than current or older technologies. Advanced technologies
combined with carbon capture and sequestration (and geostorage) or reuse (CCSR), may have
the potential to materially lower CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel-based electricity

3-5

generation. Such technologies include (but are not limited to) circulating fluidized-bed
combustors, integrated gasification combined-cycle units, and pulverized coal (advanced
supercritical and ultra-supercritical units). The proposed policy has three elements: a postcombustion technology pilot and demonstration project applied to a single coal unit; analysis and
report on a Michigan-specific comparison of the costs and benefits of advanced methods against
existing coal technologies from a GHG reduction and cost perspective; and use of financial
incentives, performance requirements, mandates, or other measures to encourage or require the
early adoption of CCSR.
ES-6.

New Nuclear Power

Nuclear power is a large-scale low-GHG, baseload source of electricity that could complement
renewable energy resources in a mix of low-GHG-emitting electric generating options.
Michigan’s 21st Century Electric Energy Plan notes that nuclear power cannot meet the need for
new generation for at least 12 years due to the extremely long lead time required to bring a new
nuclear plant on line. Nuclear power can, however, play a significant role in reducing GHG
emissions in conjunction with other low-GHG-emitting generating technologies in the time
period beyond 2020.The issue of proper storage of both existing and new nuclear waste in the
Great Lakes basin is a serious issue and must be addressed. Policies that address the barriers to
implementation and encourage the licensing of new nuclear plants in Michigan, as well as
relicensing of existing plants, may be considered. These policies could also address opportunities
for reducing the long time frame required to license and construct a new nuclear power plant.
Costs and GHG reduction benefits were calculated based upon a single new plant sized at 1,550
megawatts (MW) going on line in 2020. This recommendation was approved by a majority of the
MCAC but was not unanimous. There were six opposing votes [Pollack, Ettawageshik, Garfield,
Heifje, Bazzani and Overmeyer] and two abstentions [Martinez and Calloway for Bierbaum]

ES-7.

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP), Including CHP

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) is a process that develops plans to meet needs for electricity
services in a manner that meets multiple objectives, such as least-cost generation, emission
standards, fuel diversity, and RPS requirements. An IRP process includes the evaluation of all
feasible options, from both the supply and the demand sides, in a fair and consistent manner. In
the IRP process, companies or the state can highlight supply-side (generation capacity) options to
meet a forecasted growth in electricity demand, and can also evaluate equally technology and
policy options on the demand side to satisfy the anticipated demand. In this fashion, supply and
demand analyses are paired and evaluated jointly in a least-cost planning environment.
ES-8.

Smart Grid, Including Advanced Metering

Smart Grid systems promote efficiency through improvements in system monitoring, control
technology, and systems integration. Combining advanced metering and two-way
communication to end users with the Smart Grid technology provides a system where both the
utility and the customer can engage in integrated decisions, thus enabling and improving energy

3-6

efficiency. In addition, a Smart Grid system allows enhanced opportunities for demand response
and optimizes the deployment of distributed resources and renewable energy. This policy will
provide guidelines to utilities for evaluating advanced metering infrastructure and Smart Grid
technology projects, including cost-benefit analysis methodologies for determining the policy's
GHG emissions benefits.
ES-9.

Carbon Capture, Storage and Reuse Incentives, Requirements, R&D, and/or Enabling
Policies

CCSR is a process that includes separation of CO2 from industrial and energy-related sources,
transport to a storage location, and permanent or long-term storage in isolation from the
atmosphere. Michigan should initially encourage enhanced oil recovery and the accompanying
modest carbon storage from this activity, and sequestration in depleted oil and gas fields within
the 2–5-year time frame. By 2015, Michigan should encourage and support additional
pilot/demonstration activity for deep carbon geostorage in several locations in the state. By 2020,
Michigan should have a robust legal and policy framework consistent with national intent that
enables full-scale industrial carbon geostorage capabilities. Some key implementation issues that
will need to be explored regarding the establishment of a CCSR infrastructure include an
infrastructure build-out that extends beyond Michigan, a legal and regulatory framework for
geologic storage of CO2, state-based incentives for CCSR, and comprehensive assessments of
geologic reservoirs at the state and federal levels to determine CO2 storage potential.
ES-10.

Technology-Focused Initiatives

These initiatives focus on developing, promoting, and/or implementing one or more specific
technologies that have the potential to reduce GHG emissions. Technologies could include
(among others) hydrogen production and fuel cells for electricity storage, compressed air energy
storage systems (to enable greater penetration of intermittent renewable technologies, such as
wind), or biomass co-firing. This policy would provide state government and other private and
public parties with resources and incentives for analysis, targeted research and development,
market development, and adoption of GHG-reducing technologies that are not covered by other
policies. The specific goal would be to maximize effective use of biomass for co-firing at
appropriate coal plants as soon as practicable. This recommendation was approved by a majority
of the MCAC but was not unanimous. There were three opposing votes [Garfield, Pollack and
Heifje].
ES-11.

Power Plant Replacement, EE, and Repowering

Michigan has the second-oldest fleet of power plants in the nation. The state will most likely be
facing the retirement or repowering of a number of old, less efficient units within the time frame
of this planning process. The opportunity to replace aging units and reduce GHG-intensive
imports with more efficient in-state generation could offer a reduction in GHG emissions from
this sector. Furthermore, existing coal-based generation technologies may benefit from additional
technologies and upgrades to make their fuel burning more energy efficient (EE), resulting in
more electric output for the amount of fuel burned. Policies to encourage generation efficiency

3-7

improvements, repowering of existing plants, or power plant replacement(s) could include
incentives or regulations as described in other options, with adjustments for financing
opportunities and emission rates of existing plants.
ES-12.

Distributed Renewable Energy

This recommendation focuses on removing barriers to and providing incentives to encourage the
development of distributed renewable energy throughout the state. Distributed renewable energy
is generally defined as small scale (generally less than 10 MW), located at or near the point of
end use, interconnected to the distribution (as opposed to transmission) system, and more likely
to have homeowner or community ownership. Increasing the use of distributed renewable energy
provides electricity reliability, security, and environmental benefits. The preferred policy design
would include a well-designed and fully implemented renewable energy payment (REP)
program. A REP program may be designed to promote and encourage development of renewable
energy projects of all sizes, ranging from small residential up to the largest utility-scale projects.
The costs and benefits of this policy are incorporated into the DG “carve-out” under ES-1.
ES-13.

Combined Heat and Power (CHP)

Every business in Michigan that uses energy to heat and/or cool its buildings or as part of a
production process is technically a candidate to simultaneously also generate electricity at its
site, using one of several commercially proven and widely used combined heat and power (CHP)
technologies. CHP technologies, also referred to as “co-generation,” include steam turbines with
steam extraction or back pressure, gas turbines with waste heat recovery boilers, combined-cycle
units, reciprocating engines with manifold exhaust and cooling heat recovery, as well as less
proven technologies, such as fuel cells and Stirling engines. To achieve this goal, it will be
necessary to revise regulatory policies and remove institutional barriers to allow distributed
renewable energy and CHP systems to compete on a level playing field with other sources of
electric and thermal energy.
ES-15a.

Transmission Access and Upgrades

Various efficiency measures can be implemented to reduce transmission line losses of electricity.
By reducing constraints in the transmission system, improved transmission facilities reduce
congestion, hence reducing energy costs and GHG emissions and improving the efficiency of the
transmission and generation system. To facilitate widespread adoption of renewable energy
technologies, the current transmission system requires upgrades and additions. Renewable
energy facilities may require the addition of new or improved transmission lines that must be
seamlessly integrated into the transmission grid. Among other things, the policy calls for
Michigan to implement a “transmission system efficiency study” to determine the most costeffective measures to reduce line losses and improve overall system reliability and management,
including improving access for new generation assets, such as renewable energy, CHP, and DG
projects.

3-8

ES-15b.

Distribution System Access and Upgrades

Various energy efficiency measures can be implemented to reduce distribution line losses of
electricity. Regulations, incentives, and/or support programs can be applied to achieve greater
efficiency of distribution system components. Such distribution system improvements will help
reduce line losses and improve and manage outages, as well as enable renewable energy systems,
including DG and CHP projects, to interconnect to the grid. Among other things, this policy calls
for implementation of a distribution system efficiency study for Michigan to determine the most
cost-effective measures to reduce line losses and improve overall distribution system reliability
and management, including improving access for new generation assets, such as renewable
energy, CHP, and DG projects.

Chapter 4
Market Based Policies
Overview of Market Based Policies
The Market Based Policies (MBP) technical working group (TWG) was created mid-way
through the MCAC planning process in response to concerns from members of the Cross Cutting
Issues (CCI) and Energy Supply (ES) TWGs that some of the policies under consideration in
both TWGs required more time and attention than either could provide. After reviewing a
variety of options, the MCAC decided to create a new Market Based Policies (MBP) TWG and
transfer selected policies under the new group’s jurisdiction. The policies of principle concern
were the cap-and-trade proposal and the carbon tax proposal, but a handful of related policies
were also moved. The MBP TWG renumbered and reorganized the transferred policies. The
MBP TWG members were self-selected volunteers from the ES, CCI and Residential,
Commercial and Industrial (RCI) TWGs.
These policies selected for approval by the MCAC are different from most other
recommendations in that they are not sector-specific and they rely upon economic incentives to
achieve GHG mitigation targets. One of the three recommendations requires interstate action and
one is a process recommendation. During the TWG’s discussions several options were merged.
One policy option [a carbon tax] was not approved by a majority of the MCAC.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Congress is expressing renewed interest in national cap-and-trade legislation, and President
Obama has indicated his support for the approach. Three regions within the US are moving
ahead with the development and implementation of interstate or international programs – the
Northeastern Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), the Western Climate Initiative (WCI)
and the Midwestern Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord (MGA).
Michigan is actively participating in the development of the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Accord. The policy issues confronting the Midwestern Accord Partners will need
to be evaluated regionally and by each Partner jurisdiction, and then negotiated until agreement
is reached. These recommendations are offered to advise Michigan on the key program design
features that Michigan should support in these regional negotiations.
It is believed that Michigan and all other participating jurisdictions in the cap-and-trade program
will benefit from the combination of non-market based policies and measures such as those
proposed for the sectors and the cap-and-trade program. The cap-and-trade program allows the
achievement of GHG mitigation goals (the “cap”) at lower cost than would otherwise be
possible, and many of the non-market based policies and measures serve to remove barriers that
otherwise would obstruct access to many of the low cost options. The cap also serves to ensure
that GHG reduction goals are achieved even if the non-market based policies fail to perform as
expected.
The relationship between the policies and measures recommended elsewhere in this report and
the benefit offered by the overlay of a cap-and-trade program can be seen in a marginal cost
curve as shown in Figure 4-1. This figure ranks each of the recommended policies from left to

4-1

right in ascending order of cost. The horizontal (x) axis represents the percentage of GHG
emission reduction, and the vertical axis represents the measure’s marginal cost or savings. In the
figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual mitigation option. The width of the
segment indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the option in percentage terms. The
height of the segment relative to the x-axis shows the average cost or saving of reducing one
metric ton of GHG with the application of the policy. The figure indicates that, collectively, the
reduction potential of recommended policies from all economic sectors (excluding Agriculture,
Forestry and Waste Management in this example) can avoid about 40% of 2025 baseline
emissions in Michigan.
When regulated sources have the opportunity to purchase and sell emissions credits through an
interstate market, the relative costs and benefits from comparable mitigation measures in all
participating states become fungible. Lower cost options in one state can be developed in surplus
with funding coming from sources facing higher cost options in another state. The market ‘seeks
out and finds’ the lowest cost mitigation necessary to achieve the cap. In this way, both the
sources in the states with low cost mitigation opportunities, and the sources in the states with
high cost mitigation realize an economic benefit from the transaction.

It should be noted that the data represented in this cost curve were derived from the Council's quantified policy
recommendations, as approved. Due to the fact the Council included only a subset of all possible measures that
could be taken to reduce CO2, they do not represent the full range of potential policies for an economy-wide cost
curve.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The MCAC analyzed and is recommending three market-based policies of which only MBP-1,
Cap-and-Trade, was quantified. Cap-and-trade modeling is limited to a single year, therefore
cumulative costs and benefits are not available. The analysis does, however, project the
program’s total net economic benefit to Michigan in the target year, cost effectiveness, the flow
of emissions allowances (permits) between participating jurisdictions and the allowance price.
Two initial allowance distribution scenarios were modeled: free granting of allowances to
regulated sources (grandfathering) and the sale of 100% of allowances by auction. Table 4-1
gives Michigan’s GHG reductions and cost savings in 2020 for both the free granting and
auction cases. Note that auction-case costs do not include the payments from the bidder to the
state for the purchase of allowances at auction. This information can be found in table G-1-2 and
Annex-1 in Appendix G.

MBP-1.

Cap-and-Trade

A cap-and-trade system works by setting an overall limit on emissions (the “cap”) and either
selling or distributing, at no cost, emissions “allowances,” or permits, to regulated entities or
sources. These regulated entities must periodically surrender enough allowances to match their
reported emissions or face a penalty. Cap-and-trade creates a financial incentive for emitters to
continually seek out new emission-reducing options and cut their emissions as much as possible.
By creating a market for the allowances, regulated entities have the choice of either purchasing
allowances or directly reducing emissions and, as a result, resources are directed to the most
cost-effective emissions reduction investments. To achieve overall emissions reductions over
time, programs gradually lower the emissions “cap” by reducing the total number of available
allowances.
The MCAC encourages national action in the implementation of a cap and trade program for the
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. In lieu of national action, or in advance of future action,
Michigan should continue to participate in and encourage the development of the Midwestern
Accord program. Michigan should not seek to create its own one-state cap and trade program. It
is recommended that the program have the broadest possible sector coverage as soon as possible
to include the maximum possible number of low cost mitigation and sequestration options. The
MCAC does not make a specific recommendation on the method by which allowances are
initially distributed (free granting, auction, both, etc.), but regardless of distribution method, the
MCAC agrees that the value represented by the allowance should benefit the residents of
Michigan.
MBP-3.

Michigan Joins the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX)

The Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX), launched in 2003, is the world’s first and North
America’s only active voluntary, legally binding integrated trading system to reduce emissions
of all six major greenhouse gases (GHGs), with offset projects worldwide. CCX emitting
Members make a voluntary but legally binding commitment to meet annual GHG emission
reduction targets. Those who reduce below the targets have surplus allowances to sell or bank;
those who emit above the targets comply by purchasing CCX Carbon Financial
Instrument® (CFI®) contracts. The states of New Mexico and Illinois are Members of CCX.
By joining the CCX Michigan state government will lead by example. Michigan will inventory
and quantify all greenhouse gas emissions from sources that result from state government
operations and are under the control of state government. State government’s primary sources of
GHG are typically energy usage in office buildings and transportation.
MBP-6.

Market Advisory Group

GHG policies have broad based impacts and implications. As a result it is helpful to look at
current and future policies from a variety of viewpoints. Some states have looked at forming
groups of experts to help them evaluate both the intended and unintended consequences of GHG
policies. The MCAC recommends the creation of a formal Market Advisory Group, appointed by
the governor or appropriate agency head and approved by the Legislature, and working in

4-4

support of the governmental agency charged with the program. The advisory group would hold
regular meetings and have defined responsibilities, to include looking at the economic feasibility
of implementing GHG reduction policies. In addition to offering expert advice on the design of
market-based policies, the group would catalog current policies and laws in state and local
government, assess how each contributes to or reduce GHGs, and provide guidance to the state's
policy makers on the design of any future compliance programs to manage GHG emissions.

4-5

Chapter 5
Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Activities in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors produce greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions when fuels are combusted to provide space heating, process heating, and other
applications. In 2005, combustion of oil, natural gas, and coal in the RCI sectors contributed
about 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) to Michigan’s gross GHG
emissions. These sectors contributed 24% of the 248 MMt of GHG that the state emitted overall,
slightly higher than the national average of 22% for these sectors. Residential sector emissions
make up approximately 40% of RCI GHG emissions; commercial sector emissions,
approximately 18%;, and industrial sector emissions, approximately 42%.
Considering only the direct emissions that occur within buildings and industries, however,
ignores the fact that nearly all electricity sold in Michigan is consumed for RCI activities. If the
emissions from all three subsectors of RCI are included (i.e., direct fuel use, emissions associated
with electricity consumption, and industrial processes), they total about 68% of the state’s gross
GHG emissions in 2005. Therefore, the state’s future GHG emissions will depend heavily on
future trends in the consumption of electricity and other fuels in the RCI sectors.
Figures 5-1 through 5-3 show the trend in GHG emissions from the RCI sectors through 2025.
The figures also show the relative shares of GHG emissions, by fuel. Overall, emissions for the
RCI sectors (excluding those associated with electricity consumption) are expected to increase
by 4.1% between 2005 and 2025. For the 20-year period beginning in 2005 and ending in 2025,
the fastest growth in GHG emissions is in the commercial sector, which is forecast to grow by
1.0% annually. GHG emissions in the residential and industrial sectors are expected to grow by
0.6% per year during this period.

1990–2025*

* Emissions associated with the direct use of natural gas, petroleum, coal, and wood and the consumption of
electricity. Source: Consolidated Michigan Inventory and Forecast.

The projections for the period beginning in 2005 show almost no change in the overall shares of
emissions that the different sectors produce. The residential sector produces 35% of total RCI
GHG emissions in both 2005 and 2025; the commercial sector, produces 29% in 2005 and 30%
in 2025; and the industrial sector, 36% in 2005 and 35% in 2025.
Much of the growth in GHG emissions over the period can be attributed to an average 0.94%
annual growth in electricity demand over the 2005–2025 period for the RCI sectors. GHG
emissions from electricity for each of the three sectors are projected to grow by 1.1% per year
between 2005 and 2025.

5-2

Emissions associated with the generation of electricity to meet RCI demand account for about
55% of the emissions for the residential sector, 72% of the emissions for the commercial sector,
and 52% of the emissions for the industrial sector, on average, over the 1990–2025 period. From
1990 to 2025, natural gas consumption is the next-highest source of emissions for the residential
and commercial sectors, accounting, on average, for about 38% and 24% of total emissions,
respectively. For the industrial sector, emissions associated with the combustion of coal, natural
gas, and petroleum account for about 13%, 23%, and 12%, respectively, on average, from 1990
to 2025.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The principal means to reduce RCI emissions include improving energy efficiency, substituting
electricity and natural gas with lower-emission energy resources (such as biomass and wind), and
various strategies to decrease the emissions associated with electricity production (see Chapter 3,
Energy Supply Sectors). The state’s limited pursuit of energy efficiency until recent years offers
abundant opportunities to reduce emissions through programs and initiatives to improve the
efficiency of buildings, appliances, and industrial practices. The advantages of having “lowhanging fruit” in the form of low-cost energy efficiency opportunities in the RCI sectors are
countered by an underdeveloped private sector that will likely be responsible for scoping,
implementing, and evaluating energy efficiency projects. These “green collar” jobs require
special training and equipment that will take time for firms within the state to acquire.
Michigan has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to
concerns about energy costs and carbon emissions. Public Act (P.A.) 295, enacted in 2008,
adopted a requirement that electric providers achieve annual incremental energy savings in 2012,
2013, 2014, and 2015, and each year thereafter, equivalent to 1% of total annual retail electricity
sales in megawatt hours in the preceeding year. Additionally, natural gas providers must
achieve annual incremental energy savings in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, and each year
thereafter, equivalent to 0.75% of total annual retail natural gas sales in decatherms or equivalent
thousands of cubic feet (MCF) in the preceeding year. It should be noted that incremental
energy savings begin ramping up in 2008 and continue through and beyond 2015 as stipulated in
P.A. 295. Further, in order to ensure this outcome, each provider must file an annual report of its
progress in meeting the energy optimization portfolio with the Michigan Public Service
Commission. The Commission is now developing rules and guidance to implement these
programs.
The Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) has identified significant opportunities for
reducing GHG emissions growth attributable to the RCI sectors in the state. These include
expanding or launching utility demand-side management programs for electricity and natural gas
and removing disincentives to efficiency investments by utilities; adopting incentives, assistance,
and updated building codes to increase energy efficiency in buildings; adopting incentives and
net metering for renewable energy systems implementation; enhancing consumer education and
professional training and certification programs; and devoting greater attention to the energy
requirements associated with water use and management in the state. The MCAC has also
identified significant opportunities to reduce GHG emissions through policies addressing
electricity production; these are detailed in Chapter 3.

5-3

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The MCAC unanimously recommends a set of 10 policies for the RCI sectors, several of them in
close concert with parallel policies in the energy supply (ES) sector. These policies offer
significant, cost-effective GHG emissions reductions within the state. These recommendations
and results are summarized in Table 4.1. The GHG emission reductions and costs per ton of
GHG reductions for five of these policies were quantified. The quantified policy
recommendations could lead to emission savings from reference case projections of:
•

64.9 MMtCO2e per year by 2025, and a cumulative savings of 523.9 MMtCO2e from 2009 to
2025, and

•

Net cost savings of over $13 billion through 2025 on a net present value basis.1 The
weighted-average costs of these policies are a net savings of nearly $25/tCO2e.

Because most energy use occurs in buildings, the recommended policies center on improving
energy efficiency in buildings. There is overlap among the policies as to the types of activities
and equipment they cover, but the text following Table 5-1 provides general guidance on how
the policies complement each other. In brief, however, the policies focus on the following:
•

RCI-1 provides for utility-operated incentives for energy efficiency that will reduce energy
use.

•

RCI-2 and RCI-7 lay out a set of policies to reduce overall, statewide energy use in buildings.

•

RCI-3 focuses on setting regulatory policies that will establish rate structures to incentivize
utilities to invest in energy efficiency, or remove disincentives that are inherent in existing
utility rate structures for utilities to invest in energy efficiency.

•

RCI-4 focuses on making building energy codes more stringent.

•

RCI-5 and RCI-9 increase the human capital component of energy efficiency by providing
education and training for energy users and energy professionals across the state.

•

RCI 6 and RCI-8 focus on encouraging small-scale renewable energy capacity and
generation in the state.

•

RCI-10 focuses on reducing energy use among water utilities in the state.

The numbering used to denote the above policy recommendations is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect
prioritization among these important policy recommendations.

There is overlap in the expected emission reductions and costs among some of the policies
within the RCI sectors, as well as between policies in the RCI and ES sectors. The goals laid out
in RCI-2 for a 50% decrease in residential and commercial energy use and a 20% decrease in
overall industrial energy use are more ambitious than similar, but smaller, goals laid out in RCI-1
and RCI-7. As a result, there is overlap among these three goals, and the most ambitious goals
that are laid out in RCI-2 overlap completely with those in RCI-1 and RCI-7. The final
accounting for emission reductions avoids double counting by subtracting emission reductions
from RCI-1 and RCI-7 from the total. RCI-1 also overlaps with ES-3, but to avoid double
counting, the emission reductions produced by ES-3 are subtracted from the total.
RCI-4, focusing on new building energy codes rather than financial incentives, does not overlap
with other policies.
RCI-6, focusing on the effect of a renewable energy generation requirement from small-scale
renewable energy resources, does not overlap with other policies.
There are two primary interactions between the RCI and ES sector policies, both concerning the
clean energy portfolio components in policy recommendation ES-1 (Renewable Portfolio

5-5

Standard). Most of the RCI policies (especially RCI-2) decrease overall electricity demand. As
the renewable energy portfolio requirements are based on meeting a percentage of load with
specific renewable energy, co-firing, or nuclear resources, the costs of ES-1 would be reduced by
decreasing energy demand through these RCI policies. Also, an additional “feedback loop” effect
is that certain ES policies (including ES-1) will have the effect of reducing GHG emissions
associated with energy production, so that RCI policies that target electricity use will have a
correspondingly lower impact on overall emissions. However, this impact has not been reflected
in the analysis.
The policy recommendations for the RCI sectors are affected by both state and federal policies
that incentivize or mandate more efficient use of energy. The federal Energy Independence and
Security Act of 2007 was signed into law in December 2007. This law contains several
requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as it is implemented over the next few years.
These reductions were factored into the MCAC’s quantification of GHG emission reductions and
costs or savings.
The GHG reductions for these savings are projected to be 73.7 MMtCO2e, for 2025 using the
RCI Technical Work Group's (TWG's) CO2 methodology. In addition, through P.A. 295 of 2008,
Michigan enacted energy efficiency programs that will reduce GHG emissions by 3.3 MMtCO2e
in 2015 using the RCI TWG CO2 methodology and 24.6 MMtCO2e in 2025. The GHG emission
reductions reported here are net of and additional to these existing actions. Appendix I details the
assumptions and approach used to estimate reductions from these existing actions in Michigan.
Figure 5-4 shows the cumulative emission reductions from the five policy recommendations that
have been quantified for the entire planning period for 2009–2025, after accounting for overlaps
among these policies. There is a great deal of variation in the emission reductions from the
policy recommendations. RCI-2, with its ambitious targets for energy efficiency, will have by far
the greatest effect. RCI-4 will be important, but because it applies only to new construction, will
be limited in its overall effect. RCI-6 is focused most heavily on new, but small-scale,
generation.

* These are the reductions from the policy recommendations, net of overlaps between recommendations. Note,
options not shown in this chart were either unquantifiable or were not counted because of overlap. Also, results have
been adjusted to remove overlaps between policies; for example, RCI-7 reductions overlap with both RCI-2 and RCI4 assuming all three policies are implemented. The chart, therefore, includes RCI-2 and RCI-4 but not RCI-7 to avoid
overstating the combined benefits of the recommendations.

The policy recommendations described briefly below, and in more detail in Appendix I, not only
result in significant emission reductions and overall cost savings, but offer a host of additional
benefits as well. These benefits include savings to consumers and businesses on energy bills,
which can have macroeconomic benefits; reduction in spending on energy by low-income
households; reduced peak demand, electricity system capital and operating costs, risk of power
shortages, energy price increases, and price volatility; improved public health as a result of
reduced pollutant and particulate emissions by power plants; reduced dependence on imported
fuel sources and correspondingly greater energy security; and green collar employment
expansion and economic development.
It is also important to note that while the GHG reductions and costs or savings of these policy
recommendations have been developed according to best estimates, there remains some
uncertainty (e.g., due to timing, technology development, and/or more refined analysis)
regarding the actual GHG reductions and costs or savings that will be revealed in their ultimate
implementation. This uncertainty should be considered in the course of the state’s policy
prioritization and implementation decisions.
For the RCI policies recommended by the MCAC to yield the levels of savings described here,
they must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner. This means, for
example, not only putting the policies themselves in place, but also attending to the development
of supporting policies that are needed to help make the recommended policies effective. While
the adoption of the recommended policies can result in considerable benefits to Michigan’s

5-7

environment and citizens, careful, comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation, as
well as consistent support, of these policies will be required if these benefits are to be achieved.

Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sectors
Policy Descriptions

RCI-1.

Utility Demand-Side Management for Electricity and Natural Gas

By unanimous consent, the MCAC recommends increasing investment in electricity and natural
gas demand-side management (DSM) programs through programs run by investor owned,
municipal, and co-operative utilities, as well as energy service companies, large customers, or
others. Decreasing consumption will have immediate impacts on GHG emissions. DSM
activities may be designed to work in tandem with other recommended strategies that can also
encourage efficiency gains.
This policy recommendation focuses on improving energy efficiency through such DSM efforts
as energy efficiency, energy conservation, and peak demand reduction actions. Energy efficiency
and conservation are the lowest-cost resources for reductions in electricity and natural gas use by
the RCI sectors and thus for reduction of GHGs. There is a long track record of cost-effective
energy efficiency initiatives at the local, state, and regional levels around the country and in
Michigan. There is vast potential for improving the energy efficiency of homes, appliances,
businesses, and industry in Michigan. A number of DSM efforts are already underway or
mandated in Michigan, and important new energy efficiency legislation—P.A. 295 of 2008—
was adopted as the MCAC was concluding its efforts.
This policy recommendation considers energy-saving goals for electricity and natural gas, and
the policy, program, and funding mechanisms that might be used to achieve these goals. It is
intended to work in tandem with other RCI and ES policies recommended by the MCAC; in
particular, it echoes ES-3, the Energy Optimization Standard.
The goal of this policy is to bring the total overall demand reduction of existing actions, recent
actions (including notably newly adopted P.A. 295), plus new, additional DSM activities in
Michigan to save in each year 2% of the prior year’s electricity use and 0.75% of the prior year’s
natural gas use by the residential, commercial, institutional, municipal, and industrial sectors,
compared to a 3-year, weather-normalized, business-as-usual forecast that does not incorporate
these goals. The policy would be implemented in three phases between 2009 and 2015, followed
by a fourth, long-term phase. This goal derives in part from the efficiency goal identified in the
Midwestern Governors Association’s November 15, 2007, Energy Security and Climate
Stewardship Platform.

RCI-2.

Existing Buildings Energy Efficiency Incentives, Assistance, Certification, and
Financing

By unanimous consent, the MCAC recommends improving the energy efficiency of existing
buildings in Michigan. Because Michigan has one of the weakest energy codes in the nation, and
currently utilizes many of its World War II-era industrial buildings, energy efficiency
improvements provide a significant opportunity to reduce Michigan’s carbon footprint. This
policy would reduce energy use in existing buildings by encouraging energy efficiency upgrades
and operating improvements in existing institutional, municipal, commercial, residential, and
industrial buildings. Incentives, rebates, and property tax abatements are imperative to foster
state-wide participation in implementing energy-efficient measures to reduce future energy
generation and GHG emissions. This policy is intended to support and work in conjunction with
other policies (e.g., RCI-1) to help create a sustainable and cost-effective energy efficiency
program for Michigan.
The recommended goal is to reduce energy consumption per square foot of floor space in
existing residential, commercial, institutional, and municipal buildings by 50% from 2002 levels
by 2030, and to reduce energy consumption in the industrial sector, where building systems and
process systems are often intertwined, by 20% by 2030.
RCI-3.

Regulatory (PSC) Changes To Remove Disincentives and Encourage Energy Efficiency
Investments by Investor-Owned Utilities (IOUs)

The MCAC unanimously recommends that regulatory changes be implemented to remove
disincentives and encourage energy efficiency investments by investor-owned utilities (IOUs).
Economic regulation of IOUs by the Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) limits their
earnings potential by determining an authorized level of earnings and by establishing the allowed
earnings as a percentage of the utility rate base (i.e., the value of assets, such as power plants and
distribution networks used in the business). In designing the rates charged to customers to
recover the utility’s “revenue requirement” (expenses plus investment return on the rate base),
regulators typically assign most of the revenue requirement to predicted unit sales of gas or
electricity. This method creates financial incentives for the utility to increase—not decrease—its
unit sales and to make investments in the traditional physical assets of the business.
Successful energy conservation and efficiency programs reduce unit sales and could thus reduce
utility revenues. If program costs are expensed, there can be no incremental earnings on the
program investment, no matter how successful it is. Thus, an energy efficiency program offers
limited “upside” potential to utilities and poses a significant risk of harming profitability.
Cooperative and municipal systems apply a different earnings model, but may risk diminished
cash flow from reduced sales. Utilities’ financial incentives are to maximize unit sales, not
reduce them.
This financial disincentive can be offset by: (1) providing a possible incentive financial benefit
for a successful efficiency program; (2) changing the rate method so that expenses and earnings
are recovered by a fixed-rate charge based on the number of customers, rather than units sold; (3)
allowing sales figures to be updated between rate cases; and (4) applying a system benefits

5-9

charge to all distribution service customers to pay for the efficiency program. Items (2) and (3)
are examples of “decoupling” revenue requirements from a projected unit sales level.
Decoupling utility unit sales from profits in rate setting and/or providing the opportunity to earn
profits from successful program outcomes can realign incentives to encourage effective utility
investment in DSM, energy efficiency, and conservation and reduce the incentive to maximize
unit sales. Item (4) ensures that all customers receiving deliveries from the local distribution
utility contribute to the program costs, since the benefits are societal.
This policy is not quantifiable at this time. Its goal is to have the MPSC undertake and complete
as soon as possible, but no later than December 2010, a comprehensive study identifying
disincentives to energy efficiency investments by utilities and ways to remove them, as well as
opportunities to encourage additional energy efficiency investment by utilities. This should be
conducted in close coordination with the MCAC’s ES policy recommendations, and in keeping
with the provisions of P.A. 295.
RCI-4.

Adopt More Stringent Building Codes for Energy Efficiency

The MCAC unanimously recommends that a higher energy standard should be required for
newly constructed buildings in the state in order to reduce energy costs—the largest operations
and maintenance expense. Newly constructed buildings today become the energy-consuming
building stock of tomorrow. Strong building energy codes can be an effective way to eliminate
the use of “least-efficient” energy practices in new or renovated buildings.
The 2030 Challenge is a global initiative that targets all new buildings and major renovations to
reduce their fossil-fuel consumption by 50% by 2010 and incrementally increase this standard
for new buildings to “carbon neutrality” in 2030. The 2030 Challenge has been adopted by the
U.S. Conference of Mayors; National Association of Counties; American Institute of Architects;
U.S. Green Building Council; International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives;
Congress for the New Urbanism; states of Illinois, Minnesota, California, and New Mexico; and
numerous counties and cities. Also, the 2030 Challenge is supported by the American Society of
Heating, Refrigerating & Air-Conditioning Engineers. New building standards that meet the
2030 Challenge are currently being developed. To meet or exceed the 2030 Challenge for a 50%
GHG reduction by 2010 would require Michigan to achieve a 30% improvement beyond the
requirements of the 2006 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC).
The goal of this policy is to strengthen Michigan’s energy building codes for residential,
commercial, institutional, municipal, and covered industrial construction to match those of the
2030 Challenge. To meet the initial 2030 Challenge goal of 50% GHG reduction by 2010,
Michigan should adopt an energy code that requires 30% energy performance improvement
beyond the requirements of the 2006 IECC. In addition, thermal envelope inspections should be
mandatory for all new building construction to ensure that they are built as designed and energy
efficiency performance objectives are met in the completed structures. Michigan’s current codes
and standards can be used as baseline references; the baseline year for energy-saving
comparisons should be 2008. Michigan should also adhere to periodic upgrades of the national
standards for new residential, commercial, institutional, municipal, and industrial buildings, and
review and upgrade existing state and local building codes accordingly.

5-10

RCI-5.

Michigan Climate Challenge and Related Consumer Education Programs

The MCAC unanimously recommends that the state lead by example regarding education and
outreach by fully implementing the Michigan Climate Challenge (MCC) as one of its key efforts
in this area. Doing so would encourage Michigan businesses, institutions, local and regional
governments, and the general public to make a voluntary public commitment to undertake
actions to reduce GHG emissions in their communities.
The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, working in conjunction and consultation
with other state agencies, will develop and launch the MCC and include a Web-based “Online
Pledge” to encourage voluntary GHG reductions throughout Michigan. The MCC will provide
Web-based resources and information in the form of a “Climate Action Toolkit” for individuals
and organizations to consider implementing. The toolkit will contain specific recommendations
for reducing GHG emissions and identify measures that can minimize the impacts of climate
change, so as to be better prepared to adapt to its effects.
Each local government official, small business owner, and citizen plays an integral part in this
effort. Together, these individual actions will reduce the risks to the environment now and in the
future. The MCC will provide the opportunity and resources for communities, organizations,
businesses, and individuals to recognize climate change risks and commit to specific actions to
reverse those changes, enabling Michigan to move forward in addressing climate change.
RCI-6.

Incentives To Promote Renewable Energy Systems Implementation

By a unanimous vote, the MCAC recommends that Michigan set as a minimum target the
addition of small-scale, customer-sited, renewable distributed generation (DG) consistent with its
overall annual goals for renewable generation. Customer-sited DG powered by renewable energy
sources provides electricity system benefits, such as avoided capital investment and avoided
transmission and distribution losses, while also displacing fossil-fuel generation and thus
reducing GHG emissions. Increasing the use of renewable DG in Michigan can be achieved
through a combination of regulatory changes and incentives.
DG technologies exist across the spectrum of RCI facilities. Customer-sited renewable DG can
include solar photovoltaic systems, wind power systems, biogas and landfill gas-fired systems,
geothermal generation systems, and systems fueled by biomass wastes or biomass collected or
grown as fuel. Policies to encourage and accelerate the implementation of customer-sited
renewable DG can include direct incentives or requirements for power purchases, market
incentives related to the pricing of electricity output by renewable DG, state goals or directives,
and favorable rules for interconnecting renewable generation systems with the electricity grid.
Incentives for non-electric renewable energy applications should also be included.
Supporting measures for this policy include training and certification of installers and
contractors, net metering and other pricing arrangements, interconnection standards, and the
creation or support of markets for biomass fuels. Through an educational campaign (see policy
recommendations RCI-5 and Cross-Cutting Issues [CCI]-5), individuals and businesses can also

5-11

gain a better understanding of renewable energy options and of the requirements of the program
ultimately adopted in Michigan.
The goal of this recommendation is to increase total annual electrical generation from smallscale, customer-sited distributed renewable sources in Michigan by 2% by 2025. This
recommendation is designed to be accomplished in parallel with and as an addition to the 25%
Renewable Portfolio Standard goal set out in policy recommendation ES-1. Total energy supply
as a result of these two policies would be 27% from renewable sources.
RCI-7.

Promotion and Incentives for Improved Design and Construction in the Private Sector

Revolving loan funds are proven and effective tools for promoting energy efficiency in state and
local government facilities. The MCAC unanimously recommends that this tool should be
utilized in the private sector as well. This recommendation would facilitate investment in energy
efficiency improvements by providing zero-interest loans to local governments, which, in turn,
would extend the program to private entities. Energy cost savings for private-sector participants
would provide cash flow for repaying the principal, with the cost of the program for the local
governments limited to interest payments and loan administration.
Incentives, such as permitting and fee advantages, tax credits, and financing incentives (e.g.,
“green mortgages” or property tax abatements for buildings certified to Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design standards) should be used to encourage retrofit of existing residential,
commercial, institutional, municipal, and industrial buildings or the development of nontraditional, off-grid, low- carbon, and carbon-neutral energy sources. The state can work with
financial institutions to develop loan tools for these programs. Eligibility for the loans would be
based on the energy standards chosen. Michigan jurisdictions that have adopted enforceable
standards will be eligible for managing the loans. The IECC, or alternative standard, must be
enforced. This policy assumes a gradually increasing energy efficiency code for new
construction, backed up by strong, consistent enforcement measures.
Encouraged by the incentives offered, the goal of this recommendation is to have all residential,
commercial, institutional, municipal, and industrial buildings achieve 15% better energy
efficiency than that required by the 2006 IECC by 2015 and 30% better efficiency than that
required by the 2006 IECC by 2025.
RCI-8.

Net Metering for Distributed Generation

By a unanimous vote, the MCAC recommends implementing aggressive net metering policies to
encourage increased electric generation capacity from DG sources. Net metering enables
individuals or businesses to obtain financial benefits from small electricity generators installed at
their home or business location. It allows consumers to deliver any excess generation from their
small generators to the utility through the standard energy meter, which runs both forward and
backward during the billing period. The utility charges customer generators only for the net
amount of energy they take from the utility during the period, recognizing at retail rates all the
electricity the customer generators produce. There are several variations on this basic form of net
metering that may be considered.

5-12

A voluntary, statewide net metering program was adopted by the MPSC in March 2005 (Case
No. U-14346), but was limited to renewable energy facilities under 30-kilowatt (kW) capacity
and was capped at 100 kW or 0.1% of a utility’s peak load. Qualifying facilities could be sized
no larger than necessary to meet the customer’s needs. Several billing configurations are
permitted at the option of the utility, starting with the basic net metering form, with credits for
excess generation being for allowed up to one year. Any excess credits after one year go to the
utility to offset program costs. All regulated investor-owned and cooperative electric utilities are
participating. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires the state to consider adopting a
new standard, whereby all public utilities would have to offer net metering service to their
customers. The MPSC is considering whether to adopt this standard and is also considering other
possible changes to the voluntary program described above.
The Michigan legislature is considering requiring a statewide program with larger size limits on
the facilities and the total program cap, a mandate to use the basic net metering form, and related
measures on interconnection of facilities. The goal of this recommendation is to have 392
megawatts (MW) of electric generation capacity from DG sources installed by 2015, increasing
to 1,344 MW by 2025.
RCI-9.

Training and Education for Building Design, Construction and Operation

The MCAC unanimously recommends that Michigan provide up-to-date building performance,
code compliance, and mechanical equipment training, and develop a certification program for
code officials, builders, and contractors and facility operators who successfully complete energy
efficiency and related green building training programs. Such training programs should be
offered to building code officials, homebuilders, commercial construction contractors,
heating/ventilation/air conditioning contractors, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, remodelers,
other construction trade professionals, and facility operators. Training programs should focus on:
(1) proper construction and maintenance practices with building envelope and mechanical
performance standards, as established in revised Michigan building energy codes (see
recommendations RCI-4 and RCI-7); and (2) proper construction and maintenance practices with
building envelope and mechanical performance standards, as identified in “beyond code”
building programs.
Proactive education programs for building trade professionals are a necessary component for
successfully improving energy-efficient construction practices. Improved construction standards
resulting in energy-efficient buildings can only be accomplished if building code officials and
building trade contractors, subcontractors, and facility operators are properly educated in
building envelope and mechanical performance building and maintenance techniques. Properly
trained building code officials, building trade professionals, and facility operators will help
ensure consistent quality control and enforcement of Michigan’s enhanced building codes and
market-based building performance practices. Training programs are also needed to respond to
periodic upgrades of national standards, as well as to changes in state and local building codes.
Training should cover new RCI buildings, plus retrofits that are subject to building energy codes.
The goal of this recommendation is to begin initial training under such a program in 2009.

5-13

RCI-10.

Water Use and Management

By unanimous vote, the MCAC recommends that water utilities be required to track and report
their energy use, and that a comprehensive study be conducted to identify and adopt potential
energy efficiency improvements by water utilities. A considerable amount of energy is used to
pump, treat, and deliver water across the state. However, too little is currently known about
water utilities’ energy use and how greater efficiency could be achieved. This recommendation
aims to fill those knowledge voids and reduce energy consumption by: (1) reducing overall water
use, and (2) improving the efficiency and management of the water supply and management
facilities (wastewater treatment, potable water, irrigation, etc.) in the state.
The state’s primary users of water are currently agricultural consumers, municipal consumers,
and industrial users. Energy is necessary to pump this water from underground aquifers and
open-water sources to users, and to treat it in wastewater facilities after it is used. Improved
water use and handling efficiencies will reduce the amount of electricity used for water
distribution, and thus reduce energy costs for users and associated GHG emissions from power
plants.
Five specific recommendations are detailed in Appendix I: (1) accelerate investment in water use
efficiency; (2) increase the energy efficiency of all water and wastewater treatment operations;
(3) increase energy production by water and wastewater agencies from renewable sources, such
as in-conduit hydropower and biogas; (4) encourage and create incentives for technologies with
the capability to reduce water use associated with power generation; and (5) ensure that power
plants use the best management practices and economically feasible technology available to
conserve water (via siting, evaluation, permitting, or other processes).
The goal of this recommendation is to improve the average energy efficiency of water utilities in
the state (in terms of kilowatt-hours used per gallon pumped) by 20% between 2010 and 2013,
and to achieve a 10% overall water savings by 2025.

Chapter 6
Transportation and Land Use Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, which includes light- and heavy-duty (on-road) vehicles, aircraft, rail
engines, and marine engines, is one of the largest contributors of gross greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in Michigan. This sector accounted for 24% of Michigan’s gross GHG emissions in
2005, which was slightly under the national average of 27%. By 2025, the share of emissions
associated with the transportation sector is anticipated to decrease slightly to 22%, primarily due
to low growth in the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and the more stringent fuel
economy standards of the Energy Independence and Security Act.
From 1990 to 2005, Michigan’s GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily
at an average rate of about 1.1% annually. The GHG emissions associated with Michigan’s
transportation sector also rose accordingly, increasing by 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent (MMtCO2e) emissions during the same time period from about 50 MMtCO2e to 58
MMtCO2e.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for about 98% of transportation GHG emissions, with most of
the remaining transport-related GHG emissions coming from nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions
from gasoline engines. Emissions released from on-road gasoline consumption account for
approximately 74% of the transportation sector's GHG emissions. This has historically been the
largest share of transportation GHG emissions, and this trend is forecast to continue.
Figure 6-1 shows historic and projected transportation GHG emissions by fuel and source. As a
result of an increase in total vehicle miles traveled (VMT), on-road gasoline consumption
increased by about 16% between 1990 and 2005. Meanwhile, on-road diesel fuel consumption
rose by 96% during that period, accounting for 18% of GHG emissions from the transportation
sector in 2005, suggesting an even more rapid growth in freight movement within or across the
state.
Growth in VMT is expected to be very low in Michigan, primarily due to limited economic and
population growth in the future. GHG emissions from on-road gasoline consumption are
projected to increase by about 7%, and GHG emissions from on-road diesel consumption are
expected to increase by 34% between 2005 and 2025. The consumption of these fuels will
significantly contribute to the projected 12% increase in transportation emission levels for the
entire state of Michigan over 2005 levels by 2025.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Michigan has substantial opportunities to reduce transportation emissions. The principal means
to reduce emissions from transportation and land use (TLU) are:
•

Improving vehicle operations efficiency,

•

Replacing conventional gasoline and diesel with lower-emission fuels, and

•

Reducing the growth of VMT.

The use of fuels with lower per-mile GHG emissions is growing in Michigan, and larger market
penetration is possible. Conventional gasoline- and diesel-fired vehicles can use low-level blends
of biofuels. Alternative-technology vehicles can also use higher-level blends of biofuels, as well
as other types of alternative fuels, such as natural gas and hydrogen. The type of fuel used is a
crucial determinant of impact on emissions, as some alternative fuels have relatively little GHG
benefit. Currently, the most prevalent biofuel in Michigan is corn-based ethanol, which has
minimal GHG benefit from a life-cycle perspective.1 Key determinants of impact will be the
development and deployment of fuel types. At present, fuel distribution infrastructure is a
constraining factor.
Reducing the growth of VMT is crucial to mitigating GHG emissions from transportation.
Developing smarter land-use and transportation development patterns that reduce trip length and
support transit, ride sharing, biking, and walking can contribute substantially to this goal.
1

Biofuels analysis was based on information from the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model, version 1.8,
which indicates a life-cycle emission reduction of 15.9% for E85 corn ethanol. See Appendix I for more details on
assumed reduction factors for various types of biofuels.

6-2

Developing better planning methods and regulations, and increasing funding of multiple modes
of transportation will be key components in achieving these goals.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Michigan Climate Action Council (MCAC) recommends a set of 10 policies for the TLU
sector that offer the potential for major economic benefits and emission savings. Implementing
these policy recommendations could lead to emission reductions of:
•

10.5 MMtCO2e per year by 2025, and

•

95.1 MMtCO2e cumulative from 2009 through 2025.

The weighted-average cost effectiveness of the recommended policies is about –$36/tCO2e,
representing a cost savings. This average value includes policies that have both much lower and
much higher likely costs per ton.
The estimated impacts of the individual policies are shown in Table 6-1. The MCAC policy
recommendations are described briefly here and in more detail in Appendix I of this report. The
recommendations not only result in significant emission reductions, but offer a host of additional
benefits as well. These benefits include reduced local air pollution; more livable, healthier
communities; and economic development and job growth from in-state biofuel production. To
yield the levels of savings described here, the recommended policies need to be implemented in a
timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
There are three complementary TLU policy options that serve to reduce single occupancy
vehicle travel. Congestion mitigation (TLU-5) is designed to improve traffic flow and travel time
via expanding the use of intelligent transportation systems. Land use planning and incentives
(TLU-6) strategies include promoting and expanding regional growth management options that
result in more compact, mixed-use, transit-oriented, walkable development as well as
transportation system management and pricing that allows for greater investment in alternatives
to the single occupancy vehicle, such as public transit. The transit and travel options of TLU-7
complement TLU-5 and TLU-6 by providing the increased public transit capacity and service
improvements needed to achieve the aggressive statewide goals for increasing transit ridership as
well as carpool and vanpool participation.
Two policy options recognize that Michigan can reduce GHG emissions in the transportation
sector by encouraging more energy-efficient freight movement – (TLU-8) Increase Rail Capacity
and Address Rail Freight System Bottlenecks, and (TLU-9) Great Lakes Shipping. These options
seek to improve rail and marine infrastructure to take advantage of opportunities to move freight
via the most efficient means of transport possible in the Midwest.
TLU-1 focuses on further developing biofuels and expanding the biofuels market can
significantly reduce GHG emissions, while boosting the state’s economy.

Michigan can achieve greater alternative fuel use through a combination of research and
development, as well as through implementing voluntary and mandatory measures. Promoting
Low-Carbon Fuel Use in Transportation (TLU-1) can help make biofuels more efficient and
more available, while at the same time providing an economic benefit to the Michigan economy
by promoting in-state development and production of these fuels.
Public education, towards more efficient driving practices in TLU-2 (Eco-Driver Program),
works in conjunction with a number of the other recommended policies. Educating citizens on
how they can minimize their impact, operate their vehicle more efficiently, and cut their GHG
emissions can be a key to the success of many of these policies. Reducing truck idling (TLU-3)
can also serve to reduce the GHG impact of transportation without any change in VMT.
The advanced vehicle technology option (TLU-4) seeks to achieve per vehicle GHG emission
benefits beyond those expected to be achieved via the new CAFÉ standards, by providing
incentives for public fleet owners to purchase advanced technology vehicles. This policy could
serve to strengthen Michigan as a leader of automotive research, which would have benefits

6-4

across the state. In addition, progress on advanced vehicle technology can have benefits beyond
Michigan for energy security, economic growth and environmental quality.
Figure 6-2 shows the breakdown of the projected impacts of the recommended TLU policies,
taken together, in terms of avoided GHG emissions. For the TLU policies recommended by the
MCAC to yield the levels of savings described here, the policies must be implemented in a
timely, aggressive, and thorough manner. This means, for example, not only putting the policies
themselves in place, but also attending to the development of supporting policies that are needed
to help make the recommended policies effective. While adoption of the recommended policies
can result in considerable benefits to Michigan’s environment and consumers, careful,
comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation, as well as consistent support of these
policies will be required if these benefits are to be achieved.

Transportation and Land Use Sectors
Policy Descriptions

The policy recommendations summarized here not only result in significant emission reductions
and cost savings but also offer a host of additional benefits, such as reduced local air pollution;
more livable, healthier communities; and increased transportation choices.
TLU-1.

Promote Low-Carbon Fuel Use in Transportation

This policy recommendation promotes low-carbon transportation fuels through a package of
incentives, education, and standards, including recommendations by the Michigan Renewable
Fuels Commission (RFC). The goal is to reduce the average “carbon intensity” of on-road
transportation fuels sold within the state to achieve a 5% reduction of GHG emissions on a life
cycle carbon dioxide basis by 2015 and 10% reduction by 2025. The policy follows the June
2007 report of the Michigan RFC that recommended a variety of actions to stimulate the
production and use of renewable, low-carbon fuels within the state. These include: (1) a lowcarbon fuels program to encourage federal policy in this area and consider establishing a state
policy; (2) establish a next-generation renewable fuels feedstock program with a goal of
achieving 10% use of renewable fuels by 2012 and 25% by 2025; and (3) create a green retailers
program with tax incentives for E85 and biodiesel sales that rewards retail and wholesale outlets
that attain benchmarks in the sale of biofuels.
TLU-2.

Eco-Driver Program

Because driving behavior can significantly influence a vehicle’s fuel economy performance, this
policy would establish an eco-driving program. This program would incorporate a wide range of
initiatives that can help drivers maximize the fuel efficiency from their existing vehicles by
better understanding the direct impact that driving style, driving patterns, vehicle technologies,
and vehicle maintenance (such as proper tire inflation) have on a vehicle’s fuel economy. The
primary focus of an eco-driving campaign would target light-duty vehicles, where driver
education on eco-driving principles would have the greatest benefit. An integrated eco-driving
program in Michigan would be designed to achieve a fuel-economy increase of at least 10% in
the mid-term and up to 20% in the long-term.
A properly designed eco-driving program must move beyond a list of driver “tips” and focus on
providing the appropriate tools and programs to systematically change driver behavior. Key ecodriving principles would cover: driving style, starting and idling, trip planning, vehicle
drag/weight, proper maintenance and vehicle technology applications. The eco-driving program
would include program initiatives on direct driver training, general eco-driving education,
vehicle maintenance, and vehicle applications such as real-time fuel economy indicators. The
program would also consider a low-rolling-resistance tire initiative, options to have currently
licensed drivers to undergo additional driver training and options to incorporate direct eco-driver
training in the process of commercial truck licensing.

6-6

TLU-3.

Truck Idling Policies

This policy option aims to reduce GHG and other emissions from unnecessary idling of heavyduty vehicles, including trucks and buses. Much of this idling takes place during mandatory rest
periods to provide heating or cooling of the truck’s cabin air. Additional idling occurs during
vehicle operation, for example, when loading and unloading buses and trucks. The
implementation of public and private fleet anti-idling policies and ordinances, targeted education
of bus and truck operators, and creation of low-cost means to access available EPA-verified
technologies will help encourage emissions reductions from heavy-duty diesel engines.
Heavy-duty engine idling can be reduced by (1) providing increased availability of electrification
at privately owned truck stops or encouraging greater use of auxiliary power units (APUs; onboard generators) for heating, cooling, and other creature comforts on heavy-duty vehicles, (2)
providing financial assistance (e.g., low-interest revolving loans) to truck-stop operators and
truck owners/operators for infrastructure development or equipment purchase and (3) providing
targeted educational activities as appropriate with truck, bus, and truck-stop owners and
operators.
This policy has a goal of achieving diesel idling reductions from heavy-duty diesel engines of
40% by 2015 and 80% by 2025. It would also promote the adoption of a Michigan anti-idling
law based on the EPA Model State Idling Law and/or encourage adoption of local ordinances to
address idling during operation of buses and heavy trucks.
TLU-4.

Advanced Vehicle Technology

This recommendation calls for the creation of a policy that will expand the development and use
of more efficient vehicle design and/or hybrid propulsion systems. The goal is to make loans and
subsidies available to municipalities, local governments, and waste management organizations to
encourage more rapid adoption of advanced vehicles by public fleets (transit agencies and
schools) to achieve the use of advanced vehicle technologies (hybrid or hydrogen technology) in
10% of the fleet by 2025.
This policy could serve to reestablish Detroit as a leader of automotive research, which would
have benefits across the State. In addition, progress on advanced vehicle technology can have
benefits for beyond the borders of Michigan in terms of energy security, economic growth, and
environmental quality.
TLU-5.

Congestion Mitigation

The goal of this policy recommendation is to improve traffic flow and travel time through
expanding the use of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In conjunction with expanding ITS,
the following actions should also be considered: identifying and improving key bottlenecks,
constructing modern roundabouts at appropriate intersections, and continuing the use of the
MDOT courtesy patrol on congested roadways. A 4-day workweek and flex-time should be

6-7

encouraged to reduce congestion. All of these elements contribute to reducing travel delay for
both recurring and nonrecurring congestion.
Promoting the development of intermodal freight terminals will facilitate freight shipment on rail
and air thus reducing the volume of freight on Michigan roadways. By supporting these efforts,
the congestion mitigation policy option will allow for more efficient travel and increased
economic output.
The goals for this policy are to reduce travel time delay from recurring and nonrecurring
congestion in Michigan’s major urban areas (Metro Detroit and Grand Rapids) by 10% by 2025
and to reduce travel time related to nonrecurring congestion (i.e., road construction) by
continuing to implement and refine the Michigan Work Zone Safety and Mobility Policy.
TLU-6.

Land Use Planning and Incentives

State policies and programs need to be implemented that encourage local and regional planning
and development strategies in order to reduce the projected growth of VMT and corresponding
GHG emissions. The state will enable each region to adopt a unique mixture of policies to reach
reduction goals in its own manner. Strategies include promoting and expanding regional growth
management options that result in more compact mixed-use, transit-oriented, walkable
development; transportation system management and pricing that allows for greater investment
in alternatives to the single-occupancy vehicle, such as public transit; and use of other land-use–
related economic development tools as recommended in the Michigan Land Use Leadership
Council’s Report (2003).
The goals are (1) to reduce low density development and the conversion of greenfield open land
to development 25% by 2015, 50% by 2025, and 80% by 2050; (2) to encourage communities to
utilize an “infill” approach for both new and redevelopment projects by focusing on areas where
infrastructure already exists; and (3) to work to ensure that at least 60% of new/future statewide
growth utilizes more compact development or transit-oriented development design.
These goals can be accomplished through: (1) multi-jurisdictional land use planning and zoning
policies, tax base sharing, and providing state and local incentives; (2) market-based approaches
in future land development and housing policies that focus investments toward achieving higher
density, transit-oriented, and compact or mixed-use development; (3) integrated transportation
policies, investments, system management, and pricing; and (4) enactment of a new Statewide
Comprehensive Planning Law.
TLU-7.

Transit and Travel Options

This policy recommendation focuses on reducing the number of single-occupant vehicle trips
and improving the efficiency of daily travel by: (1) creating, enhancing, and promoting public
transit options such as commuter rail, light rail, streetcars, and bus rapid transit; (2) enhancing
transit service through route expansion, increased service frequency, longer service hours, and/or
better system coordination; and (3) facilitating increased carpooling, vanpooling, biking, and
walking. These actions will reduce GHG emissions by decreasing VMT, thus reducing fuel

6-8

consumption. The first goal is to double transit ridership by 2015 and double it again by 2025
(for longer line-haul systems). The second goal is to double the number of carpool and vanpool
participants by 2015 and double again by 2025.
A number of actions are included to help achieve the goals, including amending the Michigan
Constitution to provide a broader range of funding mechanisms for public transit, building
additional park-and-ride lots, provide incentives for transit-oriented development, incorporate
bike lanes into roadway construction/reconstruction, encourage/require sidewalks in new
developments and encourage their addition in areas where they are now absent, implement
metropolitan transit plans, pursue implementation of inter-city transit service where it is costeffective and undertake a public education campaign to effectively communicate the benefits of
public transit to people who are not current users.
TLU-8.

Increase Rail Capacity and Address Rail Freight System Bottlenecks

This policy encourages more energy efficient freight movement via railroads, where it is
practical to do so. Making or facilitating transportation infrastructure improvements that increase
rail capacity, support connectivity, and reduce rail freight system bottlenecks will help
accomplish this shift. For short hauls, truck freight is, and will likely continue to be, the mode of
choice; intermodal rail freight tends to be most effective for trips of 700-800 miles or longer.
This policy will reduce transportation sector GHG emissions from freight movement by making
system improvements with the goal of increasing the tonnage of rail freight traveling to, through
and from Michigan an additional 50% by 2020.
Freight tonnage for shipments to, through, and from Michigan is expected to increase on all
freight modes, but by far the majority of this increase is anticipated to be truck freight. Increasing
the projected tonnage of rail freight an additional 50% by 2020 potentially shifts million of tons
of cargo that would otherwise travel by truck. It is important to recognize that shipping decisions
are made by the private sector, and are not under the control of government. Investment to
encourage greater use of rail lines and intermodal shipping must be made with that reality in
mind. A variety of approaches are suggested to accomplish this, including construction of
intermodal terminals, preserving existing service and preserving right-of-ways for future new
service.
TLU-9.

Great Lakes Shipping

This policy recommendation promotes the use of marine transportation as the most energyefficient form of surface transportation to move cargo over long distances (150 miles or more).
While Great Lakes shipping decisions and services are private sector responsibilities, the public
sector has a role in providing navigation channels and related infrastructure. Actions include
maintaining the existing marine infrastructure, maintaining federal navigation channels to their
congressionally authorized depths, improving the marine infrastructure by deepening commercial
navigation channels at selected commercial ports, encouraging the development or expansion of
“short sea shipping” (also known as “marine highway”) within the Great Lakes, as well as
considering the use of ferry boats to move people and cars and consider a biodiesel program at
Michigan ports if it is feasible to burn this fuel in marine diesel engines. The focus of this policy
6-9

is on increasing shipping within the Great Lakes – not on increasing traffic through the St.
Lawrence Seaway.

Chapter 7
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management Sectors
Overview of GHG Emissions
The agriculture, forestry, and waste management (AFW) sectors are responsible for moderately
low amounts of Michigan’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The total AFW
contribution to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) gross emissions in 2005 was 14 million metric
tons (MMt), or about 6% of the state’s total. It is important to note that the AFW sector
emissions exclude combustion-related GHGs, such as diesel fuel consumption in the agriculture
sector. These fuel combustion emissions are included as part of the industrial fuel combustion
sector (and covered in the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sectors chapter). The AFW
contribution to net emissions in 2005 was less than 1% of the state’s total after accounting for the
net sequestration of carbon in the forestry sector.
Agricultural emissions include methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from enteric
(intestinal) fermentation, manure management, agriculture soils, and agriculture residue burning.
As shown in Figure 7-1, emissions from soil carbon losses from agricultural soils, livestock soils,
manure management, enteric fermentation, and fertilizer application all make significant
contributions to the sector totals. Emissions include CO2 emissions from oxidized soil carbon,
application of urea, and application of lime. Sector emissions also include (N2O emissions
resulting from activities that increase nitrogen in the soil, including fertilizer (synthetic and
livestock manure) application, production of nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes), and agricultural
burning activity.
Note that, in keeping with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods and
international reporting conventions, the Michigan inventory and forecast covers sources of
GHGs from human activities. There could be some natural sources of GHGs that are not
represented in the inventory and forecast; however these are not addressed in the Michigan
Climate Action Council (MCAC) process. In the forestry sector, since all of the state’s forests
are managed in some way, all emissions are treated as “anthropogenic,” or from human
activities. GHG reporting conventions treat all managed forests as anthropogenic sources.
Sources, such as CO2 from forest fires and decomposing biomass, are captured within the
inventory and forecast (as part of the carbon stock modeling performed by the U.S. Forest
Service [USFS]). However, CH4 emissions from decomposition of organic matter/biomass in
forests are not currently captured due to a lack of data. This methane is from decomposition in
oxygen-free (anaerobic) areas, particularly marshes and bogs.
The CO2 emissions occurring from the cultivation of organic soils are a large contributor to the
state’s total agricultural GHG emissions. By 2025, the contribution from this source is estimated
to be about 30% of the total agriculture emissions. The next-highest contributor in 2025 is
estimated to be agricultural soils from crop production, at about 19% (including N2O from
decomposition of crop residue). Methane emissions from digestive processes in ruminant
animals, known as enteric fermentation, are declining slightly due to lower animal populations;
however, they are estimated to be the third-highest contributor to agriculture sector totals in
2025, also at around 19%.

7-1

Forestry and land use emissions refer to the net CO2 flux 1 from forested lands in Michigan,
which account for about 53% of the state’s land area. The inventory is divided into two primary
subsectors: the forested landscape and urban forestry and land use. Both subsectors capture net
carbon sequestered in forest biomass, urban trees, landfills, and harvested wood products. In
addition, other GHG sources, such as N2O emissions from fertilizer application in urban areas
and CH4 and N2O emissions from prescribed burns and wildfires, are included.
Figure 7-1. Historical and projected gross GHG emissions from the agriculture sector,
Michigan, 1990–2025

MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

As shown in Table 7-1, USFS data suggest that Michigan’s forests sequestered about 12.7
MMtCO2e per year in 2005 (this excludes estimates of carbon flux from forest soils based on
recommendations from the USFS). The negative numbers in Table 7-1 indicate a CO2 sink rather
than a source. Even after accounting for the GHG sources from urban soils and prescribed
burns/wildfires, the forestry and land use sectors are still estimated to have been a net GHG sink.
Hence, during this period, forest carbon losses due to forest conversion, wildfire, and disease
were estimated to be smaller than the CO2 sequestered in forest carbon pools, such as live trees,
debris on the forest floor, and forest soils, as well as in harvested wood products (e.g., furniture
and lumber) and the disposal into landfills of forest products. The forecast for the sector out to
2025 remains a net sequestration of –12.7 MMtCO2e.

1

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere stored
in plant tissue or soils.

Note: Positive numbers indicate net emission. Based on USFS input, emissions from soil organic carbon are left out
of the forestry sector summary due to a high level of uncertainty.

Figure 7-2 shows estimated historical and projected emissions from the management and
treatment of solid waste and wastewater. Emissions from waste management consist largely of
CH4 emitted from landfills, while emissions from wastewater treatment include both CH4 and
N2O. Emissions are also included for municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion. Overall, the
waste management sector accounted for about 3% of Michigan’s total gross emissions in 2005.
While emissions are expected to grow significantly by 2025, the contribution to the state’s total
is expected to remain at about 3%.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Michigan has substantial opportunities to reduce emissions in the AFW sectors. The principal
means to reduce emissions in these areas are:
•

Improving methods for managing municipal solid waste,

•

Adopting management practices to increase carbon sequestration in both forestlands and
urban canopies,

•

Improving production and utilization of biomass for use in both solid fuel and liquid fuel
applications, and

•

Promoting farming practices that result in GHG savings.

Opportunities for GHG mitigation in the AFW sectors involve measures that can reduce
emissions within these sectors or reduce emissions in other sectors. Within these sectors, changes
in crop cultivation can reduce GHG emissions by building soil carbon (indirectly sequestering
carbon from the atmosphere) or through more efficient nutrient application (reducing N2O
emissions and embedded GHG emissions within those nutrients). The implementation of
improved farming and harvesting techniques, as well as utilization of biomass for bio-based
products, has the potential to reduce future emissions relative to current emissions from this
sector and other sectors.
Enhanced management of the state’s forests can lead to higher levels of carbon sequestration.
These enhancements can be achieved through afforestation projects and enhanced stocking in
existing forests. Conversion of land to development results in a loss of current and future carbon
sequestration potential. Slowing or stemming conversion rates provides opportunities for carbon
sequestration. In the waste management sector, waste reduction measures and landfill gas capture
and utilization can reduce landfill CH4 emissions.
Actions taken within the AFW sectors can also lead to GHG reductions outside the sectors: the
establishment of short-rotation woody crops (for example, on marginal agricultural lands) for
producing biomass energy feedstocks can replace fossil fuel consumption, including
transportation fuels and fuels used to produce electricity or steam in the energy supply (ES)
sector. Similarly, actions that promote solid waste reduction, recycling, or use of waste sources
for energy or bio-based products can reduce emissions within the sector (future landfill CH4 as
noted above), as well as emissions associated with the production of products and packaging
(recycled products often require less energy to produce than similar products from virgin
materials). Finally, urban forestry projects can reduce energy consumption within buildings
through shading and wind protection.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The MCAC recommends a set of 10 policies for the AFW sector that offer the potential for
major economic benefits and emission savings. Implementing these policy recommendations
could lead to emission reductions of:
•

17 MMtCO2e per year by 2025, and

7-4

•

147 MMtCO2e cumulative from 2009 through 2025, after adjusting for overlaps with other
sectors.

The weighted-average cost-effectiveness of the recommended policies is about –$11/tCO2e,
representing a cost savings. This average value includes policies that have both much lower and
much higher likely costs per ton.
The 10 policy recommendations for the AFW sectors address a diverse array of activities
capturing emission reductions both within and outside of these sectors (e.g., energy consumption
in the ES and Transportation and Land Use [TLU] sectors). The estimated impacts of the
individual policies are shown in Table 7-2. The MCAC policy recommendations are described
briefly here and in more detail in Appendix J of this report. The recommendations not only result
in significant emission reductions, but also offer a host of additional benefits, including
protection of biodiversity, reduced local air pollution, and economic development and job
growth. To yield the levels of savings described here, the recommended policies need to be
implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
The following are primary opportunities for GHG mitigation identified by the MCAC:
•

Agricultural crop production: Programs can be implemented with growers to utilize
cultivation practices that build soil carbon and reduce nutrient consumption. By building soil
carbon, CO2 is indirectly sequestered from the atmosphere. New technologies in the area of
precision agriculture offer opportunities to reduce nutrient application and fossil fuel
consumption. Promotion of local food production could reduce the transportation miles and
fossil fuel use associated with importing food products from other areas.

•

Production of liquid biofuels: Production of renewable fuels, such as ethanol from crop
residue, forestry biomass, or municipal solid waste and biodiesel from waste vegetable oils,
can produce significant reductions when they are used to offset consumption of fossil fuels
(e.g., gasoline and diesel in transportation and other combustion sources). This is particularly
true when these fuels are produced using processes and/or feedstocks that have much lower
fossil fuel inputs than those from conventional sources (sometimes referred to as “advanced”
or “next generation” biofuels). The goals to produce more biofuels in-state are linked to the
recommendations under TLU-1, Promote Low Carbon Fuel Use in Transportation. The costs
and benefits of liquid biofuels production are combined with the TLU policy on biofuels
consumption and presented with the results for that sector.

•

Expanded use of forest, agricultural, and MSW biomass: Expanded use of renewable
energy and bio-based products from biomass removed from forests, crop residues, lawn and
garden waste, or MSW can achieve GHG benefits by offsetting fossil fuel consumption (to
produce either electricity or heat/steam) and replacing fossil-based products. Programs to
expand sustainably produced biomass fuel production will most likely be needed to supply a
portion of the fuel mix for the renewable energy goals of policy recommendation ES-1,
Renewable Portfolio Standard.

•

Enhancement/protection of forest carbon sinks: Through a variety of programs, enhanced
levels of CO2 sequestration can be achieved and carbon can be stored in the state’s forest

7-5

biomass. These include afforestation 2 projects, reforestation programs (restocking of poorly
stocked forests), urban tree programs, and wildfire risk reduction. Programs aimed at
reducing the conversion of forested lands to non-forest cover will also be important to retain
what is currently a net forest CO2 sink in Michigan.
•

Changes in MSW management practices: By promoting source reduction, advanced MSW
recycling practices, improved organics management, and increased collection and utilization
of landfill methane, the GHG emissions associated with collecting, transporting, and
managing MSW can be reduced. The emissions reduced in this sector would come primarily
from waste management but may also provide a reduction in the fossil fuel used to transport
waste. When the life-cycle GHG reductions of source reduction/recycling/organics
management are considered, the results are substantial: over 35 MMtCO2e/yr could be
reduced by 2025.

The reductions from AFW 5B (Retention of Lands in Conservation Programs) have been left out of the sector totals,
since they relate to a soil carbon protection measure where the estimated emissions (from conservation acres being
returned to active cultivation) are not included in the business as usual (BAU) inventory and forecast (I&F). The costs
have been included in the sector totals, since these will be incurred in order to retain the level of emissions in the
BAU I&F. For AFW-5, AFW-7, and AFW-9, these include the reductions that are expected to occur within the state.

See below for discussion of overlap adjustments.

7-7

Overlap Discussion
The amount of GHG emissions reduced or sequestered and the costs of a policy recommendation
within the AFW sectors in some cases overlap with other AFW policies or policies in other
sectors. For the MCAC recommendations, overlap occurs between AFW-9 and AFW-10 in the
waste management sector. One of the policy elements of AFW-9 covers enhanced management
of organic wastes in the MSW sector. To the extent that these wastes are being diverted from
landfills to other waste management facilities (e.g., composting facilities), less organic waste is
available to generate landfill methane. This effect has been accounted for in the quantification of
AFW-10; hence, the values shown for AFW-10 above assume successful implementation of
AFW-9.
Overlap also occurs with some of the quantified benefits and costs of policy recommendations
within other sectors. Every effort has been made to determine where those overlaps occur and to
eliminate double counting. As displayed in the table above, the AFW sector totals have been
adjusted accordingly, as follows:
•

AFW-1 outlines how biomass may be utilized for energy production. The ES Technical
Work Group (TWG) also quantified the use of biomass for energy production (specifically
ES-1 and ES-10). AFW-1 utilizes a greater amount of biomass than the ES policies post2011. The biomass demand requirements for ES (in millions of British thermal units) and the
GHG reductions and costs associated with its use were removed from the AFW sector totals
in the table above, as these were considered to be accounted for under the ES analyses.

•

AFW-2 outlines how biofuels could be produced in-state to offset GHG emissions from
fossil-based fuels (primarily in the transportation sector). The TLU TWG also quantified the
benefits and costs of increased use of biofuels in TLU-1. To avoid double counting, the goals
of biofuel production in AFW-2 and biofuel consumption in TLU-1 were aligned, and then
the estimated AFW-2 biofuel production volumes and costs were used as input to the analysis
of biofuel consumption under TLU-1. Hence, the benefits and costs of AFW-2 are captured
in the overall results of TLU-1. To avoid confusion, those results are left out of the summary
table above. The quantification of production volumes and costs is still included in the
AFW-2 documentation shown in Appendix J.

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management Sector
Policy Descriptions
The AFW sectors include emission mitigation opportunities related to the use of biomass energy,
protection and enhancement of forest and agricultural carbon sinks, control of agricultural N2O
emissions, production of renewable liquid fuels, afforestation and forest management, and lower
municipal solid waste management emissions.

7-8

AFW-1.

Expanded Use of Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat,
or Steam Production

This policy dedicates a sustainable quantity of biomass from agricultural crop residue, wood
industry process residues, unused forestry residues, and MSW biomass resources for efficient
conversion to energy and economical production of heat, steam, or electricity. This biomass
should be used in an environmentally acceptable and sustainable manner, considering proper
facility siting and feedstock use, including co-location of production facilities with heat- and
steam-utilizing facilities. The objective is to create concurrent reduction of CO2 due to
displacement of fossil fuels, considering life-cycle GHG emissions associated with viable
collection, hauling, and energy conversion and distribution systems. This policy includes a
recommendation for a complete inventory of the state's biomass resources. The primary goal of
this policy is to produce 10% of total in-state electric generation from sustainable biomass
feedstock by 2025.
AFW-2.

In-State Liquid Biofuels Production

This recommendation promotes sustainable in-state production and consumption of
transportation biofuels from agriculture, forestry, and MSW feedstocks to displace the use of
gasoline and diesel. This recommendation also promotes the in-state development of feedstocks,
such as cellulosic material, and production facilities to produce either liquid or gaseous biofuels
with low carbon content. As with AFW-1, production of biomass for biofuel production must be
done in a sustainable manner. Adoption of biofuel production must be done in a way that
maintains the sustainability of feedstock, food, and other commodity supplies and natural
resources. Upon successful implementation of this policy, Michigan consumption of biofuels
produced in-state will result in better GHG benefits than these same fuels obtained from a
national or international market due to lower embedded CO2 (resulting from out-of-state fuels
produced using feedstocks/production methods with lower GHG benefits, and from
transportation of biodiesel, ethanol, other fuels, or their feedstocks from distant sources).
Successful implementation of AFW-1 and AFW-2 will also lead to higher levels of in-state
energy expenditures remaining in Michigan.
AFW-3.

Methane Capture and Utilization From Manure and Other Biological Waste

This policy seeks to reduce the amount of methane emissions and recapture energy from organic
waste materials from livestock, agricultural residues, and solid waste through the promotion of
anaerobic digestion, gasification, and other similar technologies. Co-mingling of organic wastes
with manure can substantially increase biogas production, while providing a sustainable method
for treatment and disposal. In addition, co-products may be created by these technologies, such
as stable fertilizer products and building materials. These technologies make a twofold
contribution to climate protection: the usual discharge of methane into the atmosphere is
prevented, and the burning of fossil fuels is replaced with renewable energy (biogas). The goal of
this policy is to reduce GHG emissions from handling, treatment, and storage of livestock
manure and organic waste by 15% by 2015 and 25% by 2025 through improved manure
management practices and methane utilization.

7-9

AFW-4.

Expanded Use of Bio-based Materials

This policy seeks to promote the manufacture, use, recycling, and reuse of materials made from
biological products, such as wood, fiber, wheat board, agricultural by-products, biodegradable
plastics, and green chemistry applications. These products reduce GHG emissions by
sequestering carbon and displacing the production of fossil-based products. Additional GHG
reductions can be achieved by promoting the use of Michigan-produced materials, which results
in lower transport-associated emissions. This policy does not refer to energy uses, such as
electricity or ethanol production, which are covered in AFW-1 and AFW-2. The goals associated
with this policy are to utilize 100,000 tons of bio-based products annually by 2025, and to
reclaim 150,000 tons of solid wood residues from manufacturing processes, deconstruction sites,
and urban/suburban trees annually by 2025.
AFW-5.

Promote Continuous Vegetative Cover

This recommendation is the maintenance and promotion of continuous vegetative cover, such as
wind breaks and winter cover crops to prevent soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration, and
provide new biomass sources. It also promotes the planting of cover crops with higher carbon
content than current cover on marginal lands, including buffer strips, roadsides, on-off ramp
areas, and transportation medians. GHG savings occur from carbon sequestration in the
vegetative cover, indirect sequestration via carbon accumulation in soil, and reduced fertilizer
application. The goals associated with this policy are to increase the acreage of lands with
permanent cover by 10% by 2025 (existing land that is not under forest cover); retain 90% of
lands coming out of the federal Conservation Reserve Program by 2025 in some type of
permanent cover; and reduce rates of carbon loss by restoring or enhancing the maximum
feasible percentage of wetlands by 2025.
AFW-6.

Forestry and Agricultural Land Protection

This policy seeks to reduce the rate at which agricultural and forestlands and wetlands are
converted to developed uses. The protection of these lands through conservation tools, such as
land grants and easements and tax benefits, will retain the above- and below-ground carbon on
these lands, as well as the future carbon sequestration potential of these lands. Markets for
natural products from agriculture, forests, and wetlands also serve as incentives to keep these
lands in their current state rather than convert them to development. GHG reductions come from
the prevention of release of carbon from conversion of these lands. Additionally, indirect
benefits occur through the reduction of urban sprawl, thus avoiding additional emissions from
vehicle miles traveled. The goals associated with this policy are to reduce the rate of conversion
from agriculture to developed use by 50% by 2025; maintain or increase forestland acreage by
2025, without converting agricultural land to forest, unless it has higher carbon sequestration
potential; and protect and restore northern peatlands and other wetlands to prevent releases of
GHGs, which will allow existing peatlands to continue to sequester carbon.

7-10

AFW-7.

Promotion of Farming Practices That Achieve GHG Benefits

This recommendation addresses both agricultural soil carbon management, as well as nutrient
management to achieve GHG benefits. For soil carbon management, conservation-oriented
management of agricultural lands, cropping systems, crop management, and agricultural
practices may regulate the net flux of CO2 from soil. This recommendation has four separate
elements: (1) soil carbon management, where CO2 reductions occur indirectly via the building of
soil carbon levels; (2) nutrient management, where GHG reductions occur through more efficient
use of fertilizer, which lowers fossil fuel use though lower application energy requirements in
addition to reduced N2O emissions following application; also, life-cycle GHG reductions
associated with the production and transportation of fertilizers are reduced; (3) an energy
efficiency element that seeks to reduce GHG emissions by reducing the amount of fossil fuel
consumed by farming and harvesting practices through improved technologies and increases in
efficiency; and (4) the promotion of locally produced food, which reduces fossil fuel
consumption by reducing food miles. The specific goals associated with these four policy
elements are: increase conservation tillage farming to 4 million acres by 2025; adopt soil
management and nutrient management practices on 5 million acres by 2025; reduce the net onfarm fossil fuel energy consumption by 50% by 2025; and increase the local/regional purchasing
of locally grown agricultural produce and products by 50% by 2025.
AFW-8.

Forest Management for Carbon Sequestration and Biodiversity

This recommendation focuses on the state’s existing forested lands, recognizing the significant
role that Michigan’s forests play in lowering the state’s net GHG emissions (a sink of ~13
MMtCO2e/yr) and that management could be enhanced to achieve greater net GHG benefits. The
goals associated with this policy are: enhance forestland management (including improved
stocking of understocked stands) across the state on 1 million acres through afforestation and
reforestation by 2025; achieve 40% canopy cover in urban communities by 2025 (this element
also provides energy savings through shading and wind protection); and implement wildfire
reduction community-wide protection plans for 10–12 identified communities at risk by 2025
(reducing wildfire risk protects forest carbon stores and maintains forest carbon sequestration
levels).
AFW-9.

Source Reduction, Advanced Recycling, and Organics Management

This recommendation seeks to improve the GHG profile of MSW management in the state by
reducing waste generation, increasing recycling, and improving organics management. GHG
savings occur through the reduction in landfill methane generation due to lower amounts of
waste being landfilled in the future. Even more important from a GHG reduction perspective are
the life-cycle emission reductions achieved via source reduction and recycling. Reducing or
recycling products and packaging reduces the GHG emissions associated with their manufacture
and transport, leading to significant overall reductions. While a large portion of these reductions
would occur out of state, the MCAC recognizes the importance of this recommendation in
achieving net GHG benefits. The policy goals are to achieve a 75% MSW recycling and

7-11

enhanced organics management rate by 2025, and a 50% recycling rate for industrial,
commercial, and new construction waste by 2025.
AFW-10.

Landfill Methane Energy Programs

The renewable energy (methane) created at landfills during anaerobic degradation of wastes
unable to be utilized in recycling and compost programs can be used to displace fossil fuel
through the installation of methane control and collection systems. The goal of this policy is to
implement controls or waste management options at MSW landfills, such that 50% of the
methane emissions are avoided by 2025 that would be generated under business-as-usual
conditions.

Cross-Cutting Issues
Overview of Cross-Cutting Issues
Some issues relating to climate policy cut across multiple sectors. The Michigan Climate Action
Council (MCAC) addressed such issues explicitly in a separate Cross-Cutting Issues (CCI)
Technical Work Group (TWG). Cross-cutting recommendations typically encourage, enable, or
otherwise support emission mitigation activities and/or other climate actions. The types of
policies considered for this sector are not readily quantifiable in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG)
reductions and costs or cost savings. Nonetheless, if successfully implemented, they help build a
foundation for other recommendations and will contribute to GHG emission reductions and
implementation of the MCAC’s policy recommendations described in Chapters 3–7 of this
report.
The CCI TWG developed recommendations for 10 policies (see Table 8-1) that were then
reviewed, revised, and ultimately adopted by the MCAC members present and voting. Nine of
the recommendations are focused on enabling GHG emission reductions and mitigation
activities, while one (CCI-8–Adaptation and Vulnerability) addresses adaptation to the changes
expected from the effects of GHGs that will remain in the atmosphere for decades.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The MCAC was charged with developing proposed GHG reduction goals for Michigan, along
with a set of policy recommendations designed to achieve such goals. The MCAC established
2005 as the baseline year and identified a mid-term goal of reducing the 2005 GHG baseline by
20% by 2020 and a long-term goal of an 80 % reduction by 2050.
The MCAC based its recommendations on its review of the potential overall emission reduction
estimates (as compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast for business as usual) for
33 of 54 policy recommendations for which emission reductions were quantified. It also
considered the goals and targets adopted by several other states in its deliberations. While 21
other MCAC policy recommendations were not readily quantifiable, some of them would most
likely achieve or contribute to additional reductions, including several of the CCI policy
recommendations.
A key challenge for the state in seeking to achieve these GHG reduction goals will be to identify
available resources needed to implement many of the initiatives outlined in this report,
particularly given the struggling economic conditions in the state and across the country. The
MCAC will need to work closely with other state, local, federal, and tribal governmental entities,
the private sector, institutions of higher education, citizens, and others to examine these
opportunities.
Another key challenge for the state is the need to proactively engage with the federal government
in developing appropriate federal programs and policies, while simultaneously working with
other state and regional entities to design and implement strategies most effectively employed at
this level.
8-1

In spite of these challenges, the nexus between seeking a new energy economy and significantly
reducing GHG emissions in the state offers a rare opportunity for Michigan to be a leader in
developing selected renewable energy technologies and enhancing economic and employment
conditions.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
Cross-cutting issues include policies that apply across the board to all sectors and activities.
Cross-cutting recommendations typically encourage, enable, or otherwise support emission
mitigation activities and/or other climate actions. The MCAC recommends that 10 such policies

8-2

be adopted and implemented in Michigan. All are enabling policies that are not quantified in
terms of metric tons of GHG reduction or costs.
Detailed descriptions of the individual CCI policy recommendations as presented to and
approved by the MCAC can be found in Appendix K of this report. Following are highlights of
some of the policies recommended by MCAC:
Michigan is currently participating in the multi-state Climate Registry. The state needs to
institute formal GHG inventory, forecast, and reporting functions to be carried out by a state
agency. Using standardized protocols, the state should prepare annual inventories of emission
sinks and sources and should develop forecasts of future GHG emissions in at least 5- and 10year increments extending at least 20 years into the future. The state should also develop
reporting protocols for facility-level reporting of all significant GHG emissions. Where possible,
the state should coordinate these efforts with other states, regions, tribes, and the federal
government.
Table 8-2 presents the MCAC's proposed GHG reduction goals for Michigan. These goals are
consistent with goals being considered by the Midwestern Governors Regional Greenhouse Gas
Reduction Accord process: achieve a 20% reduction of GHGs below 2005 levels by 2020 and an
80% reduction below 2005 levels by 2050. The MCAC recommends that these goals be
established through executive or legislative action. The state should also develop a tracking
system to measure progress over time in achieving GHG reductions against its recommended
goals.

Year

The MCAC encourages other governmental entities and academic institutions to establish GHG
reduction goals for their respective jurisdictions, and to develop plans, programs, and other
initiatives to achieve their respective goals. The state is already engaged in numerous “Lead by
Example” initiatives to find additional energy efficiencies and GHG reductions in state
procurements for buildings, vehicle fleets, and office equipment. These initiatives, which are
detailed in CCI-3, Appendix K, should be compiled, tracked, and shared among entities in
Michigan. This should help stimulate private-sector and individual citizen actions as well.
A public education and outreach effort will be a key to building a broad base of awareness and
support for the recommendations of this report. The MCAC has identified numerous strategies
over several years to do so in conjunction with academic, business, local government, and other
partners in this process. These outreach efforts are spelled out in CCI-5, Appendix K and are
targeted to the following audiences: state government, policymakers, future generations,
community leaders and community-based organizations, citizens, industrial and economic
sectors, and tribal governments.

8-3

While many of the MCAC recommendations will save resources over the next 11 years, as
documented through this MCAC process, some policy recommendations will require additional
resources to implement. The state should immediately seek and establish capital investments and
other funding sources for the implementation of the MCAC's recommendations. State
government should lead the efforts to generate investment and financial support. Other sectors,
including local government, industry, services, agriculture, consumers, and higher education,
should also be involved. The state should examine alternative financing mechanisms, such as
those listed in CCI-7, Appendix K, and develop proposals to implement those that are the most
promising.
Given Michigan’s vulnerability to impacts of climate change, the state should undertake a
comprehensive planning effort to assess and address the impact of climate change on the Great
Lakes, the state’s natural resources, and wildlife and fisheries. The state should start by
developing a scoping document that identifies technical and financial resources and research
needed to undergo a comprehensive planning process in 2009. When applicable and feasible, the
scoping document should identify ongoing and intended research efforts that could contribute to
the planning process. A multi-agency and diverse stakeholder team should be formed to follow
through with the planning process in 2009 and beyond. A detailed list of tasks is included in
CCI-8, Appendix K.
The state is a participant in the Midwestern Governors Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Accord and Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Platform. The state should continue this
proactive engagement with other states in the region in developing cost-effective, multi-state
reduction strategies. At the same time, the state will be pushing for progressive action at the
federal level to address climate change. Michigan will also work with the 12 federally
recognized tribes in the state to help coordinate local climate change strategies (see CCI-9,
Appendix K). This will be accomplished through either existing agencies or a designated state
entity charged with climate change issues, and through the use of existing agreements between
the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and tribes, such as the Water
Accord, or newly created mechanisms that allow government-to-government dialog on
environmental issues of mutual interest. Likewise, Michigan will welcome and seek out a
mechanism to coordinate its climate change and GHG reduction efforts with national tribal
organizations, such as the climate mitigation and adaptation dialog recently initiated by the
National Congress of American Indians, the Council of Energy Resource Tribes, and others.
Michigan should also further investigate, and if it is determined to be in the state’s best interest,
join The Climate Registry (TCR) and the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX).
It has been demonstrated that there are numerous economic and employment opportunities
associated with implementation of many of the MCAC-recommended GHG reduction policies.
The MCAC recommends that the state implement robust measures to retain existing clean tech
business and attract new investment. Some categories for attention may include: provide more
attractive financial incentives, implement policies that enhance and encourage economic growth,
seek more federal support, utilize Michigan’s existing resources and economic opportunities,
protect water resources, invest in walk-able neighborhoods and transportation mode choices,
support a diverse agricultural base, maintain traditional support for Michigan’s excellent public
research universities, and encourage and facilitate Michigan’s strong social infrastructure.
Appendix K, CCI-10 presents numerous additional examples and details about these initiatives.

8-4

Finally, there is an opportunity to enhance sustainable community development and address
environmental justice issues in Michigan as climate change mitigation is addressed at the local
level. To do so, the state needs a collaborative planning process—transformational responses that
allow for distribution of costs and benefits and opportunities for change. Numerous examples
and initiatives to do so are outlined in CCI-11, Appendix K.

Cross-Cutting Issues
Policy Descriptions

CCI-1.

Inventories, Forecasting, Reporting, and Registry

GHG emission inventories track statewide emission trends and quantify emissions from
individual sources and sinks (both anthropogenic and natural). They can be used to inform state
leaders and the public and to verify GHG reductions associated with GHG reduction programs.
GHG forecasts are scenario-based predictions of future emission trends built on inventories and
projected economic trends. These forecasts are useful for identifying the factors that affect trends
and highlighting opportunities for mitigating emissions or enhancing sinks.
Detailed GHG reporting is needed from all major GHG sources 1 in order to develop accurate
inventories. Reporting is also required for sources to participate in GHG reduction programs,
such as market-based systems like cap and trade and carbon taxation. Participation in a reporting
program prior to the establishment of a GHG reduction program establishes an early baseline that
can be used to avoid disincentives to abate emissions prior to establishment of the reduction
program.
A GHG registry enables recording of GHG emission reductions in a central repository.
Registries can establish “ownership” of emission reductions, protect baselines, and provide a
mechanism for regional cooperation. Registries can also provide a foundation for future trading
programs and facilitate the identification of opportunities for reductions.
CCI-2.

Statewide GHG Reduction Goals and Targets

In Executive Order No. 2007-42, the Governor directed the MCAC to recommend specific shortterm, mid-term, and long-term GHG reduction goals or targets for Michigan. Additionally, the
Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, signed by Governor Granholm on
November 15, 2007, establishes a requirement for its staff and appropriate state agency
1

According to The Climate Registry, individual sources are defined either as “entities” (i.e., any corporation,
institution, or organization) recognized under U.S. law, or as “facilities” (i.e., any installation or establishment
located on a single site or on contiguous or adjacent sites that are owned or operated by an entity). See
http://www.theclimateregistry.org/downloads/GRP.pdf for additional details. The official definition of a “source” is
left to MDEQ, but facility-level reporting is strongly recommended.

8-5

representatives to set regional GHG reduction targets that are consistent with member states'
targets. The establishment of a Michigan statewide goal or target can provide vision and
direction, a framework within which implementation of MCAC policy recommendations can
proceed effectively, and a basis of comparison for periodic assessments of progress. GHG
reduction goals or targets recommended by the MCAC should be consistent with the parallel
goal of an efficient, robust Michigan economy. In pursuit of similar climate progress,
approximately 20 other states have established GHG reduction goals or targets.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) determined that atmospheric GHGs
must remain below 400–450 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) to have a
reasonable chance of staying below 2oF of warming. This concentration is considered the
stabilization target. The IPCC further calculated that the industrialized nations’ cumulative
emissions over the 2000–2050 period must remain less than 700 gigatons (Gt) of CO2e. This
means that the world’s industrialized nations must reduce emissions 70%–80% below 2000
levels by 2050 to help prevent global temperature increases. For its share, the United States
needs to reduce its GHG emissions by about 80% by 2050 in order to stay within its estimated
“safe” range of 160–265 GtCO2e for that same 50-year period. That comes to a 20% per decade
reduction, or 2% per year.
The target years and GHG reduction goals included in this policy recommendation reflect a high
level of uncertainty regarding the costs and benefits of implementing GHG reduction policies in
Michigan. These goals have been examined in the second phase of the process and considered in
combination with the results of the modeling and evaluation of the selected policy
recommendations.
In accordance with the Michigan Climate Action Council Interim Report, “the strategy
development process must evaluate and consider economic and environmental impacts,
including the implementation costs or cost savings for individuals, communities, businesses, and
jobs in Michigan.” The policy recommendations detailed by the six TWGs (Agriculture,
Forestry, and Waste Management; Energy Supply; Residential, Commercial, and Industrial;
Transportation and Land Use; Cross-Cutting Issues; and Market-Based Policies) include policies
to reduce GHG emissions at low net cost, and identify opportunities for substantial net savings.
Implementation of carefully crafted policy recommendations should bring significant economic
benefits to the Michigan economy, by reducing fuel costs through efficiency measures, by
reducing the export of capital from the state, and by stimulating the Michigan economy through
the creation of new opportunities and jobs in energy efficiency, clean energy technologies,
renewable energy development, transportation, and land-use planning.
The MCAC has modified the preliminary target year and GHG reduction goals from those
originally proposed in the MCAC Interim Report to those consistent with the goals being
considered by the Midwestern Governors Association. They are presented in Table 8-2. The
policies recommended by the MCAC appear to be able to achieve a 20% reduction below 2005
levels by 2020. To do so, however, it will be necessary for the state to move expeditiously
forward with near-term implementation of the policy initiatives outlined in this MCAC Final
Report. This includes instituting formal mechanisms to monitor and verify GHG reduction
progress and periodically adjusting reduction goals and strategies when needed.

8-6

The MCAC also recommends that a formal performance tracking mechanism be developed to
gauge progress in Michigan toward achievement of the goals and targets.

State, Local, and Tribal Government GHG Emissions (Lead by Example)

The state of Michigan and many local and tribal governments have undertaken various policy
and program actions in several key areas to obtain GHG emission reductions and improve energy
efficiency. Many of these ongoing and future efforts can provide practical and working examples
of what can be done by nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions, and even private
citizens to reduce GHG emissions. Much more effort is planned and should be undertaken to
further improve Michigan's energy efficiency and reduce our carbon dependency and emission
rate, as outlined in Appendix K of this report.
State, local, and tribal governments are responsible for providing a multitude of services for the
public that are delivered through very diverse operations. This also makes them responsible for
overseeing wide-ranging GHG emission activities and provides leadership opportunities to work
with universities, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector to reduce emissions and increase
energy efficiency. For example, the state of Michigan is a major consumer of electricity and, as
such, can promote the development of environmentally benign generation and purchase a
significant portion of its power through a certified “green power” program.
While the incentive for this action will be, in part, market driven as energy costs increase, it will
only be achievable through a continued comprehensive analysis of current operations,
identification of significant GHG sources, and implementation of changes in technology,
procedures, behavior, operations, and the services provided. State, local, and tribal governments
must find ways to encourage and provide incentives for reducing GHG emissions in a variety of
ways. One of the most important is to link GHG reductions to energy expenditures, and
demonstrate that reduction in one leads to reduction in the other.
CCI-4.

Comprehensive Local Government Climate Action Plans

A number of local and regional cities and municipalities in Michigan have already taken steps
and initiated programs and activities to mitigate climate change in their communities. Many of
these cities and communities—23 in Michigan and over 900 cities nationwide—are also
signatories to the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement, and have a stated goal of reducing
CO2 emissions by 7% below 1990 baseline levels by 2012. Furthermore, cities and communities
in Michigan are helping to develop and support additional climate change accountability
programs, such as the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, TCR, and the
Michigan Renewable Energy Program.
The state and tribal governments, regional metropolitan councils (e.g., the Grand Valley Metro
Council), Michigan Municipal League, and others could all help create awareness about climate
change issues and lead by example in developing climate change programs that are coordinated
with the MCAC. Additionally, these organizations and entities could help communicate best
practices and success stories through a variety of outlets, such as workshops, conferences,
summit meetings, a Web site clearinghouse, education and outreach to public and municipal

8-7

officials, as well as recognizing local government GHG and CO2 emission reduction
achievements.
CCI-5.

Public Education and Outreach

Public education and outreach is essential to cultivating broad support for GHG reduction
activities. Education and outreach will target at least seven specific audiences in Michigan
according to policy recommendations made by MCAC members. These efforts will seek to
create awareness of climate change issues, along with providing justification for policies
designed to reduce GHG emissions. Public education and outreach efforts should build upon
existing work being done by state, tribal, and local agencies, utility companies, and nonprofit
organizations.

Tax and Cap Policies / Cap and Trade

The lead for developing this policy recommendation was transferred by the MCAC to the
Market-Based Policies TWG (see Chapter 4).
CCI-7.

Seek Funding and Financing for Implementation of MCAC Recommendations

Michigan will seek and stimulate funding and investment to implement the MCAC climate
solution recommendations. Accordingly, Michigan will position itself to successfully compete
for federal and international assistance and matching funds in adaptation and mitigation of
climate change impacts. Funding decisions will take into account both economic and
environmental impacts, including the implementation costs or cost savings for individuals,
communities, and businesses, as well as similar funding actions made by other Midwest states
and regions. As Michigan allocates funding for MCAC recommendations, the state will work to
identify choices that provide the best opportunities for mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate
change. Concurrently, Michigan will implement initial funding investments that require few
long-term costs. In addition, Michigan aims to reduce the costs associated with climate change
activities, while fostering economic growth within the state.
CCI-8.

Adaptation and Vulnerability

Climate change is a potentially serious threat to communities, natural resources, and wildlife in
Michigan, the United States, and around the world. While addressing the source of climate
change and related GHG mitigation options is critical, it is also important that decision makers
and the citizens of Michigan understand how climate change is affecting and will affect the
natural resources and natural resource-based economic activity in the state. Additional attention,
research, and funding are needed to assess the impact of climate change on Michigan’s fisheries
and wildlife and help them adapt, while also reducing the other stressors on their habitats and
ecosystems. Communications, research, and funding are also needed to assess and moderate
climate change’s impact on Michigan’s land and other natural resource-based industries
(forestry, agriculture, tourism, and recreation).

8-8

The state of Michigan should undertake a comprehensive planning effort to assess and address
the state’s vulnerability to climate change and adaptation opportunities. Various organizations
and agencies in the state are already collecting some of the information needed for such an
assessment and efforts should be made to coordinate and consolidate these information-gathering
activities.
CCI-9.

Participate in Regional, Multi-State, and National GHG Reduction Efforts

The MCAC recognizes that collaboration is a key to the successful implementation of the state
climate change strategies. Because the execution of policies designed to reduce climate change
affects all sectors of society, actions must be broad-based and inclusive. For this reason,
collaborative regional and multi-state reduction efforts offer promising possibility for
accomplishing the MCAC's target goals. Joint regional, multi-state, multi-province, and in some
cases, national approaches to GHG emission reductions and energy efficiency options can
provide greater opportunities for success, particularly because the issue of climate change is not
constrained to political boundaries. Accordingly, Michigan recognizes, has considered, and has
joined other regional and national, market-based GHG reduction strategies. Such strategies
propose to mitigate and adapt to climate change in various sectors, including energy supply,
residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, land use, agriculture, forestry, and waste
management.
The current initiatives include the state’s membership in the Midwestern Regional Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Accord, whereby the member governors and Canadian prime minister agreed to
establish a midwestern GHG reduction program with targets and time frames that are consistent
with state policies. Also included in this initiative is the development of a market-based, multisector cap-and-trade program to achieve reductions. An additional joint initiative is MDEQ's
participation on the Steering Committee for the development of TCR. The multi-state TCR was
designed to be an essential piece of infrastructure for the development of state and federal
climate change programs by forming a partnership to produce a protocol for measuring GHG
emissions. A third significant initiative offering opportunities for multi-state collaboration is the
CCX. Michigan, as well as all other members of the CCX, must achieve a minimum 6%
reduction in GHG emissions from 2000 levels by 2010. This goal is in accordance with Michigan
reduction targets.
These developments will be continued and will function as models to form the basis of future
Michigan GHG reduction programs. Michigan should consider developing supplementary or
ancillary registry capacities or opportunities to meet all of the state's needs. Michigan will
continue to examine the decisions made by other states and regions, particularly in the Midwest
states and in Canada, to identify opportunities for collaboration with other GHG reduction
efforts. Michigan will also implement regional climate reduction initiatives, such as a regional
carbon cap-and-trade system (unless a national system supersedes this need).
The Governor and the Michigan legislature should aggressively push for and continue to
encourage federal action to reduce GHG emissions and to ensure that Michigan is well
represented and protected at the federal level. An aggressive approach to GHG reductions within
the United States will have a significant effect on the international reductions needed to begin

8-9

reversing global warming trends. Ultimately, many of the climate protection issues need to be
addressed at the national level. Michigan must help shape these national initiatives.

Enhance and Encourage Economic Growth and Job Creation Opportunities Through
Climate Change Mitigation

Michigan’s response to climate change can serve as a catalyst for increasing economic activity,
in addition to reducing GHG emissions. Michigan is already home to two of the world’s leading
solar power manufacturers, and over 25 businesses provide components for the growing
commercial wind energy industry. Investors in the clean tech sector are constantly seeking
locations that offer the most advantageous markets. Texas, Colorado, New York, and
Pennsylvania have recently added thousands of green collar jobs by offering start-up capital, tax
breaks, and energy policy that welcomes clean energy. Michigan has a capable workforce,
engineering expertise, and substantial manufacturing capacity. The state also possesses
considerable natural resources that could establish it as a leader in renewable energy. Given the
intense competition from other states and nations, however, additional incentives and supportive
government policies will be necessary to maximize investment in Michigan.
CCI-11.

Enhance and Encourage Community Development Through Climate Change
Mitigation: Address Environmental Justice

Climate change is predicted to cause significant changes in both the atmosphere and the natural
environment, including increases in extreme weather events and droughts, as well as rises in sea
level in some regions and lower water levels in the Great Lakes.
Although all segments of Michigan’s population and economy will be affected by climate
change, certain communities run the risk of being disproportionately burdened by costs and
challenges, particularly poor communities and communities of color. As evidenced by the impact
of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, communities in the United States continue to be
unprepared—socially, financially, and environmentally—for major natural events.
Even in the absence of major natural disasters, climate change has the potential to devastate an
unprepared economy. Transitional costs will likely be regressive and could further burden
populations already suffering from economic hardship with unbearable costs.
To encourage community development through climate change mitigation and ensure that
vulnerable communities are protected, the state must engage a range of communities in a
collaborative planning process that works toward a transformational response to climate change.
This response must be tailored to the regressive costs posed by climate change, and must act to
address the economic and health impacts of a warming climate.
