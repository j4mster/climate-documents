Executive Summary
Recognizing the profound implications that global warming and climate variation could have on
the economy, environment and quality of life in the Southwest, New Mexico Governor Bill
Richardson signed Executive Order 05-33 on June 5th, 2005, establishing the New Mexico
Climate Change Advisory Group (CCAG). 1 The Governor directed the CCAG to prepare a
report that includes a projection of the State’s future GHG emissions and policy
recommendations for reducing New Mexico's total greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels by
the year 2012, 10% below 2000 levels by 2020 and 75% by 2050.
The New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) organized the process on behalf of the
Governor. NMED assembled 37 stakeholders, representing a broad range of interests and
expertise, and the CCAG met six times from July 2005 to October 2006. During this same
period, five sector-based technical work groups (TWGs) of the CCAG developed initial
recommendations in the areas of: Energy Supply (ES); Residential, Commercial, Industrial and
Waste Management (RCI); Transportation and Land Use (TLU); Agriculture and Forestry (AF);
and Cross-Cutting Issues (CC). With oversight from NMED, the CCAG followed a consensusbuilding process designed and implemented by the non-profit Center for Climate Strategies
(CCS). Applying a design similar to those used in other successful state climate initiatives, CCS
provided both facilitation services and technical analysis to the CCAG in formulating its
recommendations.

CCAG Policy Recommendations and Impacts
The CCAG offers 69 policy recommendations to the Governor to help meet the GHG emissions
goals in Executive Order 05-33. Figure EX-1 below presents:
•

Projected growth in New Mexico’s GHG emissions 2 (blue line).

•

Emission targets in the Executive Order (red line).

•

Projected emissions if the CCAG’s recommendations are fully implemented (green line).

As the figure illustrates, the CCAG’s recommendations would more than meet the Governor’s
targets, and are projected to reduce GHG emissions by approximately half, from 70 MMTCO2e
in the reference case forecast to 34 MMTCO2e by 2020. Table EX-1 (appearing below Figure
EX-1) provides the numeric estimates underlying Figure EX-1.

Appendix A contains the Executive Order.
The “reference case” projection of emissions was developed during the CCAG process, along with the inventory of
historical emissions since 1990, as set forth in detail in Chapter 2.

The CCAG’s recommendations are summarized below in Table EX-3, followed by short
descriptions of each recommendation. Detailed descriptions and analysis of these
recommendations are presented in Chapters 3 through 7 of this report, and in the Appendices.
Cumulative GHG reductions from 2007-2020 are estimated at 267 MMTCO2e. The
recommendations are projected to create net economic savings of over $2 billion for the State’s
economy over the period 2007-2020. 3
As discussed in Chapter 1, the Governor’s goals are consistent with the levels and framework of
goals set by other states, including those in the West, that are implementing GHG reduction
strategies. The CCAG’s recommendations also complement other efforts underway in New
Mexico, especially the Governor’s many initiatives to make it the “Clean Energy State.” This
report also points to numerous co-benefits that would result from implementation of CCAGrecommended policies.

Chapter 1
Background and Overview
The Governor’s Executive Order
Recognizing the profound implications that global warming and climate variation could have on
the economy, environment and quality of life in the Southwest, New Mexico Governor Bill
Richardson signed Executive Order 05-033 on June 5th, 2005, establishing the New Mexico
Climate Change Advisory Group (CCAG). 1 The Governor directed the CCAG to prepare a
report that includes:
•
•
•
•
•

Proposals for reduction of New Mexico's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 2000
levels by the year 2012, 10% below 2000 levels by 2020, and 75% by 2050.
An inventory of existing and planned actions that contribute to GHG emissions
reductions.
Consideration of costs and benefits of proposals.
An inventory of historical and forecasted GHG emissions in New Mexico.
Findings on initiatives to create meaningful regional and national policy to address climate
change.

This report is the outcome of that effort, one that involved a distinguished and broad group of
stakeholders, the New Mexico Environment Department and other state agencies, and the Center
for Climate Strategies.
The Governor’s Executive Order noted the scientific consensus on this issue as embodied by
reports issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the National
Academy of Sciences. Climate models indicate that global average temperatures could rise
from 3 to 10 degrees by the end of this century. The IPCC predicts that such a warming will
result in rising sea levels, increased rainfall rates and heavy precipitation events (especially over
the higher latitudes) and higher evaporation rates that would accelerate the drying of soils
following rain events. With higher sea levels, coastal regions could face increased wind and
flood damage, and some models predict an increase the intensity of tropical storms.
Executive Order 05-033 also directed State agencies to prepare a study on the potential effects of
such warming on New Mexico. That study, issued in December 2005, cites the potential for
prolonged drought, increased snowmelt, reduced snow pack, severe forest fires, and other
harmful effects. 2

Recent Policy Developments
In 2004, Governor Richardson declared New Mexico “The Clean Energy State”. The state has
completed implementation of many programs and initiatives to promote clean energy and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions under the Governor’s leadership. Examples include:
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

New Mexico was the first state in the country to initiate state government membership in the
Chicago Climate Exchange. The Exchange requires members to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions annually or buy credits from those that reduce more than required.
New Mexico has inventoried state government’s emissions of greenhouse gases and is
working on programs to promote reduction of greenhouse gas emissions throughout state
government operations.
The Governor issued an executive order that requires all state agency buildings that are
newly constructed or renovated to adopt the LEED system.
Under Governor Richardson’s executive order, by 2010, 15% of state agency fuels purchased
must be from renewable fuels, such as ethanol or biodiesel; and 75% of state agency vehicles
acquired each year must be capable of operating on alternative fuels or be gas-electric
hybrids.
The State’s renewable portfolio standard requires 10% renewable energy by 2011 and
utilities are required to offer a green power tariff to allow ratepayers to opt to pay a premium
for renewable energy.
Recent legislation to promote renewable energy development includes solar energy tax
rebates on installation of solar energy systems, an energy production tax credit to provide
incentive for renewable energy development, and net metering allowance.
The Governor has established a Clean Energy Development Council to develop policy
recommendations to grow clean energy in New Mexico. The Council has several
subcommittees devoted to various sectors of renewable energy and energy efficiency, like
wind, solar, and biomass power, as well as green buildings.

On October 31, 2006, Governor Richardson announced his plans for future clean energy
development and greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the state (many of which are consistent
with CCAG recommendations). 3 He proposed:
•
•
•
•
•

Increased funding for public school facilities to help build green public schools across the
state, increasing energy efficiency.
A tax credit to promote green offices and homes.
A tax cut for consumers purchasing certified energy-efficient large appliances and central
heating and cooling systems.
Tax credits for the use and distribution of biofuels, and a requirement to increase use of
biofuels to 20% of transportation fuel by 2020.
Adoption of the State Clean Car Program which will dramatically reduce the greenhouse gas
emissions of new cars and trucks sold in New Mexico by approximately 22% by 2012 and
30% by 2016.

•

An increase in the state’s renewable portfolio standard to 15% by 2015 and 25% by 2020.
Tax credits for renewable energy factories.
An Energy Innovation Fund to develop new technologies for clean energy.

Governor Richardson is also committed to action at the regional level. He partnered with
Governor Napolitano of Arizona to commit both states to working together towards greenhouse
gas emissions reductions through western and national initiatives, such as regional inventories
and registries. New Mexico is participating with thirty other states in developing a policyneutral registry tool that will enable regional and/or national cap and trade programs in the
future. The Governor also joined with Governor Schwarzenegger of California in committing
the Western Governor’s Association to goals of 30,000 megawatts of clean energy produced in
the west by 2015 and a 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020. .

The CCAG Process
The CCAG held its first meeting on July 27, 2005, followed by over a year of intensive factfinding and consensus building. The CCAG met six times, with its last formal meeting on
October 30, 2006. During this period five sector-based technical work groups (TWGs) of the
CCAG met over 60 times via teleconference, beginning in August 2005 and concluding in
October 2006.
The TWGs consisted of CCAG members as well as individuals not on the CCAG with interest
and expertise in the issues being addressed by each TWG. The five TWGs were: Energy Supply
(ES); Residential, Commercial, Industrial and Waste Management (RCI); Transportation and
Land Use (TLU); Agriculture and Forestry (AF); and Cross-Cutting Issues (CC).
The CCAG process involved a model of informed self-determination through a facilitated
stepwise consensus building approach. Under the oversight of NMED, the process was
conducted by the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS), an independent, expert facilitation and
technical analysis team, based on procedures that CCS consultants have used in a number of
other state climate change planning initiatives since 2000, adapted specifically for New Mexico.
During the course of the process, the CCAG evaluated an inventory and projection of future
GHG emissions, specific mitigation options, and findings related to benefits, costs, and
feasibility issues associated with options. The CCAG process sought, but did not mandate
consensus, and it explicitly documented the level of CCAG support for individual policy
recommendations and key findings established through a voting process, including barriers to
consensus where they existed.
The recommendations adopted by the CCAG and presented in this report underwent two levels
of screening by the CCAG. First, a potential policy option being considered by a TWG was not
accepted as a “priority for analysis” and developed for full analysis unless it had a supermajority
of support from CCAG members (with a “supermajority” defined as five or fewer “no” votes or
objections). Second, after the analyses were conducted, only policy options that received at least
majority support from CCAG members were adopted as recommendations by the CCAG and
included in this report. In total, of the 69 policy recommendations adopted by the CCAG, 67
received unanimous consent, and 2 received a majority of support (see later chapters in this
report and the appendices for details).

Analysis of Options
With CCS providing facilitation and technical analysis, the TWGs prepared policy options for
CCAG consideration using a “policy template” conveying key information:
•

Policy description

•

Key uncertainties

•

Policy design (goals, timing, parties
involved)

•

Contributing issues

•

•

Feasibility issues

Implementation mechanisms

•

•

Status of group approval

Related policies / programs in place

•

•

Level of group support

Estimated GHG reductions and costs

•

Barriers to consensus

In its deliberations, the CCAG modified and embraced various policy options. The final
versions, conforming to the original policy templates, appear in Appendices F through J and
constitute the most detailed record of decision of the CCAG. Appendix E presents a description
of the methods used for quantification of policy options. Three key methods are summarized
here:
•

Estimates of GHG reductions. Using the projection of future GHG emissions (see below) as
a starting point, analysis of the impact of policy options produced estimates of the GHG
reductions attributable to each option in the years 2012 and 2020, and cumulative over the
time period 2007-2020. Many options were estimated to affect the quantity or type of fossil
fuel combusted; others affected methane or CO2 sequestered, etc. Among the many
assumptions involved in this task was selection of the appropriate GHG accounting
framework, namely, the choice between taking a “production-based” approach vs. a
“consumption-based” approach to various sectors of the economy. 4 The CCAG took a
“production-based” approach in all sectors except the electricity sector, in both forecasting
emissions and in estimating the GHG impacts of policy options. This issue, along with other
GHG estimation issues (e.g., analysis of overlapping or interacting policy impacts), are
discussed in detail in Chapter 2, Appendix D, and Appendix E. In addition, the application
of the consumption–based approach for the electricity sector receives additional treatment in
Chapter 5 and Appendix H.

•

Estimates of cost. CCS and the TWGs produced estimates of the cost of various policy
options, both in terms of a net present value from 2007-2020 and a dollars-per-ton cost (i.e.,

4

In brief, a production-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services produced
within the state, and a consumption-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services
consumed within the state. In some sectors of the economy, these two approaches may not result in significantly
different numbers, however, the power sector is notable in that it is responsible for large quantities of GHG
emissions, and states often produce far more or far less electricity than they consume (with the remainder
attributable to power exports or imports).

1-4

cost-effectiveness). 5 The costing approach used was similar to a conventional cost-benefit
framework but had some important differences:








•

Benefits vs costs. The principal benefit of the CCAG options is reduced GHG emissions
and these were quantified simply as tons. There was no attempt to monetize the benefit
of these reductions. Many options did create easily monetized non-GHG benefits, e.g.,
fuel savings and electricity savings. In these cases, monetized benefits were subtracted
from monetized costs, resulted in net costs. These net costs could be positive or negative;
negative costs indicated that the option saved money or produced “cost savings.”
Direct vs. Indirect Effects. Cost estimates were based on “direct effects”, i.e., those borne
by the entities implementing the option. 6 Implementing entities could be: individuals,
companies, and/or government agencies, etc. In contrast, conventional cost-benefit
analysis takes the “societal perspective” and tallies every conceivable impact on every
entity in society (and quantifies these wherever possible).
New Mexico vs. National/Global perspective. Costs estimates were based on
implementing entities in New Mexico, not on a broader societal perspective (national or
global). One implication of this is that national taxes or subsidies that affect actions in
New Mexico were not part of the analysis.
Discounted and “Levelized” Costs. Fairly standard approaches were taken here. The
“present value” of costs were calculated by applying a real discount rate of 5%. Dollarsper-ton estimates were derived as a “levelized” cost per ton, dividing the “present value
cost” by the cumulative GHG reduction measured in tons. As was the case with GHG
reductions, the period 2007-2020 was analyzed.

Contributing issues. The CCAG recommendations were guided in part by the GHG
reductions and monetized costs and benefits of various options, but members also felt that
other considerations should have weight as well. The CCAG developed a checklist for
TWGs to use to keep in mind important human, social, economic, environmental, and other
factors that may warrant consideration when evaluating GHG emission reduction strategies.
The TWGs were asked to examine these qualitative terms where deemed important, and
quantify them on a case by case as needed depending on need and where data was readily
available.

New Mexico GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case
Projections
Pursuant to the Governor’s Executive Order and in cooperation with NMED, CCS prepared a
draft document, entitled New Mexico GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections,
1990-2020 (hereafter Inventory and Projections). The projection of future emissions aimed to
capture as accurately as possible the trajectory of emissions given policies in place as of 2005.
The draft was presented to the CCAG at its first meeting, and then approved by unanimous
consent at the CCAG’s 3rd meeting following technical review and revision. 7 The Inventory and
5

The analysis addressed cost and did not attempt to estimate specific price changes or utility rate changes that might
result from implementation of a policy option.
6
“Indirect effects” were defined as those borne by entities other than those implementing the option. These indirect
effects were quantified on a case-by-case basis depending on magnitude, importance, need and availability of data.

With final technical corrections performed for this final CCAG report.

Projections included detailed coverage of all economic sectors and GHGs in New Mexico,
including future emissions trends and assessment issues related to energy, economic and
population growth. The assessment provided four discrete perspectives on total State emissions
related to:
• The distinction between “gross emissions” (leaving aside sequestration) or “net emissions”
(in which reductions due to sequestration are subtracted from gross emissions).
• How the “production-based” vs. “consumption-based” accounting issue was handled (see
earlier discussion).
These two key factors resulted in the following perspectives:
1. Gross GHG emissions using the production-based approach in all sectors
2. Net GHG emissions using the production-based approach in all sectors
3. Gross GHG emissions using the consumption-based approach in the electricity sector
4. Net GHG emissions using the consumption-based approach in the electricity sector
After considering the relative merits of these perspectives, the CCAG decided to take the fourth
perspective in attempting to meet the Governor’s emission reduction targets. A detailed
discussion of the issues involved appears in Chapter 2 and Appendix D. 8
The Inventory and Projections revealed substantial emissions growth rates and related policy
challenges. Figure 1-1 shows the reference projections for New Mexico’s gross GHG emissions
(not counting sequestration) as increasing from 55 MMtCO2e in 1990 to 90 MMtCO2e in 2020,
growing by 65% over that period. Accounting for sequestration in New Mexico’s forests and
soil would decrease the gross estimates by about 20 MMtCO2e in each year, resulting in net
emissions of 70 MMtCO2e in 2020. Figure 1-1 also provides illustrates the sectoral breakdown
of forecasted GHG emissions.

8

Earlier drafts of CCAG documents showed a consumption-based treatment of the fossil fuel production sector, but
discussions late in the process result in the CCAG approving a more conventional production-based approach.

The inventory and projection of New Mexico’s GHG emissions provided several critical
findings, including:
•

As is common in many states, the electricity and transportation sectors are two of the sectors
with the largest emissions, and are expected to grow faster than other sectors in the years
ahead.

•

A significant portion (over 20%) of New Mexico’s emissions are attributable to fossil fuel
production (not merely the end-use consumption of fossil fuels). In many states, this sector’s
contribution is negligible.

While New Mexico’s emissions growth rate presents challenges, it also provides major
opportunities. Key choices on technologies and infrastructure can have a significant impact on
the emissions of a fast-growing state. The CCAG’s recommendations document the
opportunities for the State to reduce its GHG emissions while continuing its strong economic
growth by being more energy efficient, using more renewable energy sources and increasing the
use of cleaner transportation modes, technologies and fuels. The inventory and reference case
projections are discussed in more detail in Chapter 2 of this report and the entire study appears in
Appendix D.

Overview of CCAG Policy Recommendations
The CCAG is making 69 policy recommendations to the Governor to help meet the GHG
emissions goals in Executive Order 05-033. If implemented, the recommendations are projected
to reduce the State’s GHG emissions by 35 MMtCO2e by 2020. Figure 1-2 below illustrates the
level of reductions that this goal would achieve compared to the projected growth in New

For New Mexico, as for any state above, meeting a near-term reduction goal will require prompt
and energetic implementation of the required GHG reduction policies by State government and
all stakeholders. Meeting longer-term goals will require a consistent commitment by successive
governors and legislatures, aided by an equal commitment by those same stakeholders. An
added challenge in New Mexico relates to the fact that a substantial portion of New Mexico’s
GHG emissions in the electricity sector come from power plants located on tribal lands that are
not subject to state regulatory authority and from electric cooperatives that are under limited state
regulatory authority. The electricity sector GHG reductions estimated here assume that tribes
and electric cooperatives will adopt policies parallel to the state policies recommended by the
CCAG. Thus cooperation and participation of the tribes and the co-ops in the effort to reduce
New Mexico’s emissions is critical.

1-9

The CCAG’s recommendations are summarized briefly in words and tabular form in the
Executive Summary, along with rankings of the options in terms of total GHG reductions and
cost (or cost savings). Chapters 3 through 7 and the Appendices provide detailed descriptions
and analysis of GHG reductions, costs, additional impacts, feasibility, etc. for individual options
developed by the five Technical Work Groups:
•

Cross Cutting Issues (CC)

•

Residential, Commercial, Industrial (RCI)

•

Energy Supply (ES)

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU)

•

Agriculture and Forestry (AF)

Although not prepared in coordination with other state and regional actions, the
recommendations adopted by the CCAG are consistent with and supportive of resolutions
adopted by the Western Governors Association (WGA), including those adopted at its June 2006
annual meeting in Sedona, Arizona, pertaining to “Regional and National Policies Regarding
Global Climate Change,” 9 “Clean and Diversified Energy for the West,” 10 and “Transportation
Fuels for the Future,” 11 as well as the recommendations of the WGA’s Clean and Diversified
Energy Advisory Committee. 12
The CCAG’s recommendations also complement other efforts underway in New Mexico,
outlined at the beginning of this chapter. This underscores the potential co-benefits of the
CCAG’s recommended policy options.

Chapter 2
Inventory and Projections of GHG Emissions
Introduction
Executive Order 05-033 directed the NMED to prepare an inventory of New Mexico’s
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a projection of future emissions. NMED requested the
Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) to prepare a draft document for this purpose, and to request
the CCAG and its Technical Work Groups to review the methodology, assumptions, and
conclusions. The CCAG conducted this review, and at its third meeting, it unanimously
approved the final document, New Mexico Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory and Reference
Case Projections, 1990-2020 (hereafter, the Inventory and Projections, Appendix D to this
report).
This chapter presents a summary of the full study, Inventory and Projections, and includes the
emission estimates (historical and projected) along with key methodological issues and
uncertainties. These estimates are intended to assist the State and stakeholders understand past,
current, and possible future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in New Mexico, and thereby
inform the policymaking process.
Historical GHG emissions estimates (1990 through 2003) 1 were developed using a set of
generally-accepted principles and guidelines for State greenhouse gas emissions, as described in
Section 2, relying to the extent possible on New Mexico-specific data and inputs. 2 The reference
case projections out to 2020 are based on a compilation of various existing New Mexico and
regional projections of electricity generation, fuel use, and other GHG emitting activities, along
with a set of simple, transparent assumptions described later in this chapter.
Inventory and Projections covers the six types of gases included in the US Greenhouse Gas
Inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these greenhouse
gases are presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the
relative contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a Global
Warming Potential (GWP) weighted basis.

1

For some sectors and sources, historical data are only available through 2000, 2001 or 2002.
A starting point for this analysis was the 1996 New Mexico GHG emissions inventory prepared by the Waste
Management Education and Research Consortium (WERC) as part of New Mexico Greenhouse Gas Action Plan:
Enhancing our Future through Mitigation (WERC 2002). This report included a single historical year (1996) and a
more limited set of emissions sources and gases than included here. WERC is a consortium of the New Mexico
State University, the University of New Mexico, the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, and Diné
College in collaboration with Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

New Mexico Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Sources and Trends
Initial analysis suggests that in 2000, New Mexico produced about 83 million metric tons 3
(MMt) of gross carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions, an amount equal to 1.2% of total
gross US GHG emissions. 4 Gross emissions include all major sources and gases, most notably
the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants, vehicles, buildings, and industries (82% of total
State emissions), the release of methane from oil and gas production, coal mines, agriculture, and
waste management (13%), and other sources such industrial processes and nitrous oxide from
agricultural soils (5%).
Net emissions combine gross emissions sources with carbon sequestered and released from
biomass throughout the State. Very preliminary estimates suggest that from the late 1980s
through the late 1990s, New Mexico’s forest areas sequestered about 21 MMtCO2e per year. If
these estimates are applied to 2000, the State’s net GHG emissions would be 62 MMtCO2e,
about 25% lower than the gross emissions estimate. However, there are rather large uncertainties
regarding changes in carbon stocks in New Mexico forestlands since 1997, the year that the US
Forest Service conducted its most recent forest inventory in the State, especially given drought
and disease conditions since that time. Therefore, we focus most of this section on gross
emissions sources, for which there is greater certainty. Net emissions are also shown below,
using the only historical estimates available as a placeholder until better estimates are available.
The State’s gross GHG emissions increased by about 21% during the 1990s, somewhat slower
than the US as a whole, where emissions rose by 23%. This slower increase appears largely
attributable to a few key factors, in particular limited growth in new power generation facilities
and the decline of the mining industry and its fuel and electricity requirements. Were it not for
these factors, New Mexico’s emissions could well have increased as fast as, or faster than, the
national average, given the State’s more rapid population and economic growth. 5
Transportation-related GHG emissions, which are driven directly by fuel use and in turn by
population, rose by 29% in the 1990s, and represent one of the State’s fastest growing GHG
emissions sources.
On a per capita basis, New Mexico produces near twice the GHG emissions as the national
average (45 vs. 25 tCO2e per person). New Mexico’s high per capita emissions are largely the
result of its GHG-intensive gas, oil, and electricity production industries. Figure 2-1 shows that,
like the nation as a whole, per capita emissions have remained fairly flat, while economic growth
outpaced emissions growth throughout the 1990-2002 period. During the 1990s, gross GHG
emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 33% nationally, and by 31% in New Mexico.

All GHG emissions are reported here in metric tons.
United States emissions estimates are drawn from Climate Analysis Indicators Tool (CAIT) version 1.5.
(Washington, DC: World Resources Institute, 2003), which is based on official USEPA reports. Available at:

During the 1990s, population grew by 20% in New Mexico compared with 13% nationally, and state GSP grew by
76% compared with national GDP growth of 72%.

In addition to being a key facet of the State’s economy, as noted, energy producing industries are
the dominant feature of New Mexico’s GHG emissions profile. Together, the production of
electricity and fossil fuels accounted for two-thirds of New Mexico’s gross GHG emissions in
the year 2000, as shown in Figure 2-2. In comparison, these activities accounted for only 35 to
40% of national gross GHG emissions. 6
Emissions of greenhouse gases by electric power plants, the State’s leading emission source, are
relatively well understood, and are for the most part (carbon dioxide at facilities over 25 MW)
continuously monitored. Over 90% of these emissions occur at the State’s coal-fired facilities,
and two plants, San Juan and Four Corners, account for about three-quarters. Natural gas-fired
power plants produce the remaining emissions from this sector.
Emissions of carbon dioxide and methane occur at many stages of the fossil fuel production and
delivery process (drilling, production, processing/refining, and pipeline transport), and can be
highly dependent upon local resource characteristics (e.g., pressure, depth, water content, gas
concentrations), technologies applied, and practices employed at individual wells sites and
compressor stations. With over 40,000 oil and gas wells, three oil refineries, several gas
processing plants, and tens of thousands of miles of gas pipelines in the State – and no regulatory
requirements to track CO2 or CH4 emissions – there are significant uncertainties with respect to
the State’s GHG emissions from this sector.
Preliminary estimates however, suggest that fossil fuel industry emissions are quite high. The
majority of emissions come from natural gas production, with significant emissions resulting
from fuel use at field sites, processing plants, and pipelines (6 MMtCO2e), the release of
associated CO2 found in the coalbed methane from the Fruitland field in the San Juan Basin (5

MMtCO2e). Further analysis is needed to resolve some of the large unknowns regarding these
and other oil and gas sector emissions.

As a fraction of total GHG emissions, transportation accounted for 17% of New Mexico
emissions, compared with 26% of national emissions. However, on a per capita basis, New
Mexicans actually consume more gasoline and diesel fuel, and produce more transportationrelated GHG emissions, than the average American.
The remaining use of fossil fuels – natural gas, oil products, and coal -- constitutes another 9% of
State emissions, about half in residential and commercial buildings and the other half among
non-fossil-fuel industrial (RCI) sectors. While GHG emissions from residential and commercial
fuel use grew about 10% from 1990 to 2000, industrial fuel use grew in the early 1990s, but has
since declined, most likely a reflection of reducing mining and smelting activity in the State.
Agricultural activities such as manure management, fertilizer use, and livestock (enteric
fermentation) result in methane and nitrous oxide emissions that account for 7% of State GHG
emissions. Industrial process emissions comprise about 2% of State GHG emissions today.
Landfills and wastewater management facilities produce methane and nitrous oxide emissions
accounting for the remaining 2% of current State emissions in 2000.

Reference Case Projections
Relying on US DOE and New Mexico agency projections of population, employment, and
electricity use, input from NMED staff and industry experts, we developed a simple reference
case projection of GHG emissions through 2020. 7 The reference case assumes a continuation of
current trends and reflects, to the extent possible, power plants under construction and the
implementation of recently enacted policies, such as the State’s Renewable Portfolio Standard,

which currently requires investor-owned utilities to provide 10% of the electricity sales from
renewable sources by 2011. 8
As illustrated in Figure 2-3 and shown numerically in Table 2-1, under the reference case
projection, New Mexico’s gross GHG emissions are projected to grow steadily from recent
levels. (For more details on emissions by source, see Table 2-5 at the end of this section.) By
2010 they would reach 89 MMtCO2e, 8% above year 2000 levels. By 2020, they would climb
another 14% to 102 MMtCO2e, which corresponds to a total increase of 23% above year 2000
levels. These decadal increases would be slower than New Mexico’s 21% increase in GHG
emissions from 1990 to 2000.

These different rates of growth by decade can be explained by looking more closely at changes
by sector, as shown in Figure 2-4.

The numbers in this table reflect a minor update to the original draft inventory and forecast report. A reporting
error for coal-based electricity production, whereby coal-based electricity production was held flat 2018-2020, was
found and fixed. The net effect is to increase emissions by 0.7 MMtCO2 in 2020 emissions.

As shown, electricity production emissions grew significantly from 1990 to 2000, as existing
coal plants increased production and two new power plants came on line. 10 The year 2000 was
also the time of the Western power crunch, where drought conditions on the West Coast, and
other market factors led to increase demands for power on the Western grid system. Electricity
production has since declined, and only recently returned to 2000 levels. With much of new
electricity capacity this decade expected to come from natural gas and wind facilities, growth in
statewide electricity emissions is likely to be limited. However, during the 2010-2020 period,
with gas prices rising and several new coal plants being proposed, electricity emissions could
rise rapidly again, as illustrated in Figure 2-5 below.

10

Increased generation from existing plants accounted for 90% of the increase in emissions from 1990 to 2000.
Generation from the Four Corners coal plant did not change significantly, however generation at the San Juan coal
plant increased by 33%, Escalante generation increased by 20%, and Rio Grande generation almost doubled. The
Delta Person plant came on-line in 2000 (150MW) and the Milagro cogeneration unit in 1996 (61 MW). Note that
CO2 emissions from biomass-fired combustion are not counted as net GHG emissions, consistent with USEPA and
UNFCCC practices. To the extent that use of biomass energy leads to changes in carbon stocks in farms and forests,
these standard methods suggest that this should be captured in forest and land use accounting.

Fossil fuel industry emissions in New Mexico grew rapidly in the 1990s with total natural gas
production rising from 1015 billion cubic feet in 1990 to 1802 billion cubic feet in 2000. Natural
gas production has dropped slightly since 2000. The future of New Mexico natural gas and oil
production is highly uncertain, dependent on global price trends, discovery of new reserves, and
other factors. For projection purposes, we assume that new reserves will be found and exploited
such that recent production levels of oil and gas will be maintained. 11
The implication of this forecast in terms of GHG emissions is illustrated in Figure 2-6 below.
This chart shows GHG emissions from the natural gas production and processing stages, the
principal emissions sources for the oil and gas industry, and those most likely to be affected by
future changes in production. GHG emissions from gas production and processing activities
remain relatively constant from 2003 onward, with a slight increase owing to the increasing
concentration of CO2 over time in coalbed methane production.

The Energy Supply Technical Working Group reviewed and affirmed this assumption for projection purposes.

As Figure 2-4 shows, the transportation sector is expected to be the leading source of overall
GHG emissions growth from 2000 onward. Under the assumptions described in the
transportation section (see Appendix D for details), increasing diesel use for freight transport is
projected to account for nearly half of this growth (3.7 MMtCO2e from 2000 to 2020).
Increasing gasoline use would account for nearly as much growth (3.5 MMtCO2e), driven largely
by State population growth, while rising jet fuel use would account for the remainder (0.8
MMtCO2e).
Other key sources of emissions growth include direct use of fuels in the residential, commercial,
and non-fossil fuel industrial sectors, the switch to use of HFCs as substitutes for ozonedepleting substances, and methane emissions from dairy herds.

Consumption vs. Production-Based Emissions
As noted, New Mexico’s emissions are well above the national average largely because of coalbased electricity generation and natural gas production activities, a significant fraction of which
meets needs in other states. This situation raises an important question with respect to how these
emissions should be addressed from an accounting and policy basis. In other words, should
states focus on: a) all emissions produced within the State (production-based emissions), or b)
the emissions associated with production of electricity, natural gas, and/or other energy-intensive
products consumed within the State (consumption-based emissions).
Reporting production-based emissions has the advantages of simplicity and consistency with
typical inventory methods. If used for policy purposes, e.g. for setting emission reduction goals
and tracking progress in meeting them, production-based reporting will account for changes in
emissions resulting from new in-state power plants or gas production facilities, even if such
facilities are built largely to serve out-of-state consumption. Conversely, future declines in
natural gas production, due for example to the depletion of gas reserves as noted, could lead to
significant reductions in reported State emissions related to gas production activities. Such
changes in the State’s reported emissions could be very significant, and but may also be rather
difficult to predict or manage. Furthermore, one could argue that these changes do not reflect
“real” emissions changes, if electricity or gas consumers would otherwise source their electricity
or gas from similar sources in other states or countries.
In contrast, reporting consumption-based GHG emissions can be more complex from an
accounting perspective. However, the consumption-based approach may also better reflect the
emissions (and emissions reductions) associated with consuming activities occurring within the
State, particularly with respect to electricity use (and efficiency improvements), and is thus may
be useful in a policy context. Under this approach, emissions associated with electricity exported
to other states would need to be covered in those states’ accounts in order to avoid double
counting or exclusions (indeed, California, Oregon, and Washington are currently considering
such an approach). The consumption-based approach also leads to projections that are likely to
be less volatile (subject to major changes), and future GHG emissions are perhaps more directly
influenced by state-based policy strategies such as energy efficiency on overall emissions.

2-9

However, developing a robust tracking system for a consumption-based approach could be rather
challenging.
For this inventory, we prepared simplified consumption-based estimates for the electricity sector.
We estimated the ratio of in-State electricity consumption to total production, and applied this
ratio to the total GHG emissions from that sector. (See Table 2-4 near the end of this chapter.)
While this method may not precisely reflect the sources of electricity used to meet in-state
demands, it does provide a rough guide.
The result of these calculations is shown in Figure 2-7 and Table 2-2 below. Emissions related
to electricity use are about 30-40% lower than for electricity production, reflecting the fact that
the State produces about 30-40% more electricity than it needs for its own use.

Key Uncertainties
As in any exercise of this nature, there are still data gaps and uncertainties in the inventory and
projections. Closer review of the many sources of oil and gas sector emissions and estimates of
future oil and gas production could improve projections of New Mexico’s future GHG
emissions. Key drivers of GHG growth rates include inherently uncertain economic,
demographic, and land use trends (including growth patterns and transportation system impacts),
Table 2-3 presents the assumptions used in this study.

12

The numbers in this table reflect a significant technical change to the original draft inventory and forecast report
that used a consumption-based approach for the fossil fuel industry. Late in the process, the CCAG approved
production-based approach to this industry. As an example of the consequent changes, this increased the 2020
projection for the industry by 14 MMT and this change flowed through to energy total, gross emissions total, etc.

* Population, employment and VMT projections for New Mexico were used together with US DOE’s Annual Energy
Outlook 2005 projections of changes in fuel use on a per capita, per employee, and per VMT, as relevant for each
sector. For instance, growth in New Mexico residential natural gas use is calculated as the New Mexico population
growth times the change in per capita New Mexico natural gas use for the Mountain region. New Mexico population
growth is also used as the driver of growth in cement production, soda ash consumption, solid waste generation, and
wastewater generation.

In addition, the following three areas are subject to considerable uncertainty, not simply because
the future is hard to predict, but because of limited data availability and scientific understanding:
•

Oil and gas sector emissions: As noted above, the sheer number and diversity of
different GHG-emitting activities, combined with the fact that GHG emissions are
typically unmonitored, means that there is significant uncertainty with regard to emission
levels. Local estimates of field gas use and provided by the New Mexico Oil and Gas
Association (NMOGA) suggest the top-down estimates of natural gas production-related
emissions provided here (based on national average emission rates) may be low.
Furthermore, CO2 emissions that may occur as the result of CO2 mining and use for
enhanced oil recovery could be significant, but have not been estimated. Further analysis
of emissions from activities in all of the State’s principal gas and oil basins, as well as of
emissions from transmission and distribution sources could help to resolve some of these
uncertainties. Given the large emission reduction potential that may exist in these
sectors, such efforts could be quite valuable.

•

Terrestrial carbon emissions and sinks: The net forest and land use sequestration
estimates noted above are based on recent improvements to US Forest Service carbon
stock inventory data but do not fully address all issues that impact the quality of the
emission estimates.
For instance, US Forest Service assessments only cover the parts of the State that the US

2-12

Forest Service defines as forest, which represented 27% of the total State land area in
1997. Between the dates of the two most recent forest inventories, 1987 and 1997, the
Forest Service changed its technical definition of forestland from minimum of 10%
canopy cover to a minimum 5% cover. As a result, later years in the inventory period
report increased carbon stocks due to this definitional change. According the US Forest
Service contacts, there is no ability on their part to normalize the forested acreage to a
single definition (either 5% or 10%). However, the overall impact of the change in forest
definition is expected to be small in comparison to other forest carbon modeling issues,
including a lack of carbon measurements in pinyon/juniper systems (an important land
cover type in NM).
To the extent that rangelands may sequester or emit carbon, while small on a per acre
basis, they may be quite significant at the State level. This is due to the large amount of
rangeland cover present in New Mexico. However, the carbon cycle for rangelands is not
well understood, and the current inventory does not include rangeland carbon
sequestration estimates. Additional research in this area is recommended.
Another data limitation arises from the lack of inventory data since 1997. Due to funding
constraints in New Mexico, US Forest Service data from the Forest Inventory Analysis
(FIA) are not available from 1997 onward. As a result, biomass reductions from wildfires
and forest health problems, or other carbon stock changes since that time, are not
reflected in the estimates provided here. These changes need to be clarified to provide
accurate forest carbon projections. For the time being, forest carbon projections are based
solely on a linear extrapolation of the 1987-1997 period for which data are available, and
do not factor in the effects of potential future changes in forest health, productivity and
use.
•

Black carbon and other aerosol emissions. Emissions of aerosols, particularly black
carbon from fossil fuel and biomass combustion, could have potential significant impacts
in terms of radiative forcing (i.e. climate impacts). Methodologies for conversion of black
carbon mass estimates and projections to global warming potential involve significant
uncertainty at present. This inventory and forecast does not attempt to estimate these
other potential contributors to climate change.

Goals and Cross-Cutting Issues
Overview of Goals and Projected Impact
of CCAG Recommendations
In his Executive Order 2005-033 issued on June 9, 2005, Governor Bill Richardson directed that
the CCAG investigate and help create meaningful regional and national policy initiatives to
address climate change. Such initiatives are already underway concerning the reporting of GHG
emissions and the registration, for possible future recognition or credit, of GHG emission
reductions in a “GHG Registry.” Governor Richardson also called for recommendations
associated with public education and outreach. The CCAG has addressed these directives in the
following cross-cutting policy recommendations. Implementation of these recommendations
will help ensure that New Mexico’s interests are adequately represented in the development of
broader regional and national initiatives that are likely to ultimately frame national climate
change policy outcomes.

Overview of Cross-Cutting Issues
Some issues relating to climate policy cut across multiple or all sectors. The CCAG addressed
such issues explicitly in a separate technical work group as “cross-cutting” issues rather than
assigning them to any individual sector. These issues include the reporting of GHG emissions by
entities, the registering of any GHG reductions achieved by entities for possible future credit
and/or recognition, and a variety of public education and outreach initiatives regarding climate
change. The Cross-Cutting Issues Technical Work Group (CC TWG) developed policy options
for each of these issues.
At its January 11, 2006 meeting, the CCAG also asked the CC TWG to develop a checklist to
define “contributing issues” that warrant consideration when evaluating GHG emission reduction
strategies. The list of contributing issues includes important human, social, economic,
environmental, and other factors. This checklist was made available to TWGs to consider as
they formulated their policy recommendations, and is included at the end of Appendix F.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The GHG reporting and registry programs referenced above present special challenges and
opportunities. Any regional or national effort involves reconciling the interests and perspectives
of different states. The states – even in the West – are at much different stages of the learning
curve with respect to these and other climate actions. This situation, however, provides New
Mexico with unusual opportunity to influence how regional or national cross-cutting programs

3-1

will be designed and implemented, and correspondingly, how effectively the State’s interests will
be reflected in these policies. By being the first state to join the Chicago Climate Exchange
(CCX), for instance, New Mexico helped reinforce CCX’s quantification approaches and
protocols (including the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol Initiative) 1 as appropriate instruments for
states, making it more likely that other states will join CCX and/or use the same protocols. New
Mexico will also benefit, of course, from the enhanced effectiveness of GHG reporting and
registry programs if implemented on a broad regional or national basis instead of through
separate, state-by-state efforts. Public education and outreach programs can be difficult to
develop and measure, but successful climate action will ultimately hinge on the public’s
awareness of climate risks and solutions.

Overview of Policy Recommendations
Cross-cutting issues include policies and measures that apply across the board to all sectors and
activities. Cross-cutting recommendations typically encourage, enable, or otherwise support
emissions mitigation activities and/or other climate actions. The CCAG recommends three such
policies be adopted and implemented by the State. All three are enabling policies that are not
quantified in terms of tons or costs.
First, a rigorous GHG emissions reporting program is vital to understanding where GHG
emissions are coming from and thus where mitigation opportunities lie. A GHG reporting
program is also crucial in measuring future progress. Second, a GHG Registry can help
recognize and share emission reduction accomplishments. It can also protect entities’ interests
by rigorously recording their early GHG reduction efforts and accomplishments. Finally, public
awareness of climate change is essential to the public’s acceptance of concerted climate action,
so a comprehensive public education and outreach program is warranted. Detailed descriptions
of the individual Cross-Cutting Issues policy options as presented to and approved by the CCAG

Cross-Cutting Issues
Policy Descriptions

CC-1 State Greenhouse Gas Reporting
GHG reporting reflects the measurement and reporting of GHG emissions to support tracking
and management of emissions. GHG reporting can help sources identify emission reduction
opportunities and reduce risks associated with possible future GHG mandates by moving “up the
learning curve.” Tracking and reporting of GHG emissions can also help in the construction of
periodic state GHG inventories. GHG reporting is typically a precursor for sources to participate
in voluntary GHG reduction programs, opportunities for recognition, a GHG emission reduction
registry, and to secure “baseline protection.” Further, developing a GHG reporting program
could enable the state to influence the development of GHG reporting practices throughout the
region and nation and build consistency with other state or regional GHG reporting programs.
Accordingly, the CCAG recommends that New Mexico develop and implement a GHG reporting
program as soon as possible. In order to encourage GHG mitigation activities from all quarters,
GHG reporting should not be constrained to particular sectors or sources. Mandatory reporting
should be phased in as standardized quantification protocols, base data, and tools become
available, and other entities should be allowed to report GHG emissions voluntarily. The state,
municipalities, and other jurisdictions should be allowed to report emissions associated with their
own activities and programs. Reporting should be applicable to all sources, targeting
organization-wide emissions within New Mexico with greatest possible “granularity” in order to
facilitate baseline protection. Every effort should be made to build upon the considerable work
already done on reporting structures, issues, protocols, and methodologies in order to maximize
consistency and reciprocity with federal, regional, and other states’ GHG reporting programs.
GHG emissions reports should be verified through self-certification and NMED spot-checks, but
to qualify for future registry purposes, reports should undergo third-party verification. Projectbased emissions reporting should be allowed when properly identified as such and quantified
with equally rigorous consistency. Finally, the reporting program should apply common sense
with respect to de minimis emissions and provide for appropriate public transparency of reported
emissions.
CC-2 State Greenhouse Gas Registry
Building upon a rigorous GHG emissions reporting program, a GHG emissions reduction
registry reflects measuring and recording GHG emissions reductions in a central repository with
a “transaction ledger” capacity to support tracking, management, ownership, and exchange of
emission reductions. A GHG Registry provides a framework to enable recognition for GHG
reductions, provide baseline protection, and assist in the crediting of actions. A GHG Registry
can assist in measuring progress toward emissions reduction goals and provide a mechanism for
regional, multi-state, and cross-border cooperation.

3-3

Building on the GHG reporting program recommended in CC-1, the CCAG recommends that
New Mexico participate in the development of a regional or national GHG registry or develop
and implement a state GHG registry as soon as possible. The GHG Registry should strive for
maximum consistency with other state, regional, and/or national registry efforts in order to build
upon the considerable work already done in this area and to ensure reciprocity with federal,
regional, and other states’ GHG reporting programs. The GHG Registry should also provide
maximum flexibility as GHG mitigation approaches evolve, and require adequate verification to
ensure quality. The registry should allow participants to go as far back chronologically as good
data exists – as affirmed by third-party verification – and it should allow registration of projectbased reductions or “offsets” that can be rigorously quantified. The GHG Registry should
provide guidance to assist participants; incorporate safeguards to ensure that reductions aren’t
double-counted by multiple participants; provide appropriate transparency; and allow the State,
counties, and municipalities to be valid participants for reductions associated with their
programs, direct activities, or other efforts. Program costs should be borne primarily by
participants.
CC-3 State Climate Public Education and Outreach
Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a broad awareness of climate change issues,
effects, and opportunities among the State’s citizens (including co-benefits, such as clean air and
public health). Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in actions to reduce GHG
emissions. Public education and outreach efforts should integrate with and build upon existing
outreach efforts involving climate change and related issues in the State. Ultimately, public
education and outreach will be the foundation for the long-term success of all the mitigation
actions proposed by the CCAG as well as those which may evolve in the future.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico lead by example in its own education and outreach
activities by establishing a pro-active public education and outreach capability and using it to
target education and outreach activities to five specific audiences: (a) policymakers (legislators,
regulators, executive branch, agencies); (b) younger generations; (c) community leaders and
community-based organizations; (d) the general public; and (e) industrial and economic sectors
(such as professional training, licensing, and certification programs). Included in the numerous
actions recommended are: (1) the creation of one or more “Outreach Coordinator” positions; (2)
annual agency-specific reports on GHG reduction progress; (3) educating policymakers on
climate change and the CCAG’s recommendations; (4) using “best practices” in public schools
so as to educate students and parents first-hand; (5) promoting climate research and solutions
efforts at state universities; and (6) educating the media about climate change risks and
opportunities.

Chapter 4
Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and
Waste Management Sectors
Overview of GHG Emissions
The residential, commercial, industrial, and waste management (RCI 1 ) sectors are directly
responsible for only about one-tenth of New Mexico’s current gross GHG emissions (8.8
MMtCO2e in 2000). Direct emissions result principally from the on-site combustion of natural
gas, oil, and coal, the release of CO2 and fluorinated gases (HFCs, PFCs) during industrial
processing (largely cement and semi-conductors), the use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) in the
utility industry, and the leakage of HFCs from refrigeration and related equipment. 2
Considering only the direct emissions that occur within buildings and industries, however,
ignores the fact that nearly all electricity sold in the state is consumed as the result of residential,
commercial, and industrial activity. If the emissions associated with producing the electricity
consumed in New Mexico are considered, RCI activities are associated with over half (about 53
percent) of the state’s gross GHG emissions. 3 The State’s future GHG emissions therefore will
depend heavily on future trends in the consumption of electricity and other fuels in these sectors.
Figure 4-1 shows historical and projected RCI GHG emissions by fuel and source, and illustrates
the large fraction of RCI emissions associated with electricity use. RCI emissions associated
with electricity and natural gas use are expected to rise by nearly a third between 2000 and 2020,
and are likely to account for over 40 percent of the State’s growth in gross GHG emissions
during this period. 4

1

We refer here to RCI as encompassing waste management activities and emissions.
RCI fuel use accounted for 7.3 MMtCO2e in GHG emissions in 2000, while industrial process emissions, largely
from cement production, the use of perfluorocarbons in the semi-conductor industry, the use of SF6 by utilities, and
the use of substitutes (such as HFCs) for ozone depleting substances accounted for 1.5 MMtCO2e.
3
Gross emissions here denote greenhouse gas emissions from activities in New Mexico, adjusted for exports of
electricity, oil, and gas, but not including consideration of estimated “sinks” of greenhouse gases in the forestry and
land-use sectors.
4
The exception is process emissions from the semi-conductor industry, which are expected to decline significantly
due to voluntary efforts.

Table 4-1 shows estimated historical and projected emissions from management and treatment of
solid wastes and wastewater from the RCI sectors. Emissions from waste management consist
largely of methane leaking from landfills, while emissions from wastewater treatment include
both methane and nitrous oxide. These emissions, in terms of carbon equivalents, are relatively
minor compared to overall RCI emissions, yielding 2010 and 2020 estimated emissions equal to
about 3% of RCI emissions.

Overall emissions associated with residential, commercial, and industrial activity have been
similar across the three sectors. The combination of moderate population growth and increasing
commercial sector activity over the coming decades the residential and commercial sectors,

4-2

together with relatively slow growth in emissions in the industrial sector in New Mexico, means
that the residential and commercial sectors will account for a larger share of emissions in 2020,
under business as usual conditions, relative to their shares in 2000. Manufacturing activity is
expected to continue to grow at a rate of about 2.1% per year, though this growth is likely to be
offset by continuing declines in overall energy intensity due to energy efficiency gains and
structural shifts to less energy-intensive industries. 5

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The principal means to reduce RCI emissions include improving energy efficiency, substituting
electricity and natural gas with lower-emission energy resources (such as, solar water heating
and biofuels), more aggressive recycling and waste reduction programs and various strategies to
decrease the emissions associated with electricity production (see Energy Supply). The state’s
relatively limited pursuit of energy efficiency until recent years offers strong opportunities to
reduce emissions through programs and initiatives to improve the efficiency of buildings,
appliances, and industrial practices. At the same time, New Mexico’s relatively strong
population growth, and the stated commitments of New Mexico’s leaders to carry out significant
emissions reductions, places pressure on communities and businesses to make swift decisions. A
key challenge lies in the design and implementation of strategies that address State goals and
thus ensure new buildings and industries take full advantage of opportunities to reduce energy
use and emissions.
5

Projections of manufacturing and non-manufacturing activity (employment growth) are based on estimates from
the New Mexico Department of Labor. Declines in energy intensity are based on projections by the U.S.
Department of Energy (Annual Energy Outlook 2005).

4-3

New Mexico has already taken important steps in this direction. Efficient Use of Energy Act
(SB 644), signed into law in 2005, directs public electric and gas utilities to develop, fund and
implement comprehensive, cost-effective energy efficiency programs. In 2002, the New
Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) unanimously approved a rule that requires
utilities to offer a voluntary renewable energy tariff (green pricing option for customers). While
an indication of the growing momentum for improving efficiency and reducing emissions, these
actions only begin to tap the overall potential of the state to slow its growth of energy use and
GHG emissions.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The CCAG recommends a set of 21 policy options for the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors (including waste management) that offer the potential for major economic benefits and
emissions savings. As summarized in Figure 4-3, these policy recommendations could lead to
emissions savings from reference case projections of 7 MMtCO2e per year by 2020, cumulative
savings of over 47 MMtCO2e from 2006 through 2020. 6 They could result in net cost savings of
over $630 million through the year 2020 on a net present value basis (NPV). 7 Most emissions
savings from the RCI options are in the form of reduced carbon dioxide emissions, with
relatively minor reductions of emissions of other greenhouse gases (principally methane and
nitrous oxide) produced via leakage and/or combustion of fuels.
The estimated impacts of the RCI and solid waste policy recommended by the CCAG are shown
in Table 4-2. Also shown in Table 4-2 are the results of several policies that have either been
recently implemented or will be implemented as a result of earlier State policies. These “Savings
from Recent RCI Actions” are not accounted for in the reference inventory and forecast, but
contribute to overall emissions reduction along with savings from the CCAG-recommended
measures. The combination of savings from recent actions and CCAG policies are, in the RCI
sectors, estimated to be slightly greater than the projected reference case growth in emissions
from 2006 through 2020, as shown by the trend in the dark area in Figure 4-3.

6

Note that these figures do not include additional emission savings from recent actions not included in the reference
case forecast. Note also that the emissions savings and costs of a number of the policy recommendations were not
quantified. See the Appendix G for more detailed information. Of the total 47 MMtCO2e in cumulative emissions
savings from the RCI policies, 29 MMtCO2e are from reduced electricity consumption, 9 MMtCO2e are from the
reduction in on-site use of fossil fuels, and 8 MMtCO2e are from solid waste management (total differs due to
rounding).
7
The net cost savings are based on fuel expenditures, operations, maintenance, and administrative costs, and
amortized, incremental equipment costs. All NPV analyses here use a 5% per year real discount rate.

The CCAG policy recommendations described briefly here, and in more detail in Appendix G,
result not only in significant emissions and costs savings, but offer a host of additional benefits
as well. These benefits include – but are by no means limited to – reduction in spending on
energy by homeowners and businesses, contributions to local economic development, reduced
local air pollution, and improvements in comfort, convenience and indoor air quality as a result
of building improvement measures.
In order for the RCI policy options recommended by the CCAG to yield the levels of savings
described here, the options must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
This means, for example, not only putting the policies themselves in place, but also attending to
the development of “supporting policies” that are needed to help make the recommended options
effective. Many of these supporting policies are a part of the package of RCI options and many
are included among the policies recommended as “cross-cutting” policies (see Chapter 3).
Improved building codes (RCI-7A through RCI-7C) will not be optimally effective, for example,
without training of contractors, builders, architects, financial institutions, and building
inspectors, among others, in the methods and benefits of efficient building design (as
recommended in RCI-10). Regulatory policies that provide incentives and lower disincentives
for the adoption of consumer-sited combined heat and power and renewable electricity
generation are also among the supporting policies crucial to the success of the RCI options
recommended by the CCAG; some of these policies are already in the formative stages (or
beyond) in New Mexico. The CCAG’s work indicates that there are considerable benefits to
both the environment and to consumers from adoption of the policy options offered, but careful,
comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation, as well as consistent support, of these
policies will be required if these benefits are to be achieved.

Residential, Commercial, Industrial (RCI)
Policy Descriptions

The Residential, Commercial, Industrial Sectors include emissions reduction opportunities
related to improving energy (and sometimes water) use efficiency, using lower GHG energy
sources, and enhancing waste management practices.

RCI–1: Demand Side Management (DSM) Programs, Energy Efficiency Funds, and/or
Energy Efficiency Requirements for Electricity
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico increase the efficiency of electricity use in New
Mexico by increasing investment in demand-side management programs through programs run
by utilities or others, energy efficiency funds, and/or energy efficiency requirements. This
option focuses on what are typically termed DSM activities, and is designed to work in tandem
with other strategies recommended by the CCAG that can also encourage efficiency gains.
The policy design includes two key and linked dimensions: achievable/desirable energy savings
and policy/administrative mechanisms to achieve these savings. It is recommended that
investment in electricity efficiency programs rise to the level needed capture the state’s full,
achievable energy efficiency potential, which is currently estimated to be an approximately 1.0%
reduction in total electricity demand each year (relative to baseline levels). This savings level is
consistent with the findings and recommendations of the Western Governors’ Association
Energy Efficiency Task Force, and can be achieved by increasing investment in cost-effective
energy efficiency to the level of about 3% of utility revenues (that is receipts from customer
bills) by 2012. This spending level exceeds the base level 1.5% of utility revenues currently
allowed under the recent Efficient Use of Energy Act.
In order to implement expanded DSM programs, the CCAG recommends that a number of
mechanisms be considered. Candidate mechanisms include revising existing statutes to enable
utility investments in energy efficiency at the levels indicated above, to consider as potentially
eligible programs that are cost-effective taking into account the valuation of for CO2 emissions.
Policy and administrative mechanisms that might be applied include regulator-verified savings
targets, public benefit charges, portfolio standards, “energy trusts”, integrated resource planning,
performance-based incentives, decoupling of rates and revenues, appropriate rate treatment for
efficiency, and/or others. Note that it is not the intent to specify here how this policy might be
implemented; the mechanisms above are offered only as options to be considered.

4-8

RCI-2: Demand Side Management (DSM) Programs, Energy Efficiency Funds, and/or
Energy Efficiency Requirements for Natural Gas and Other Fuels
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should increase the efficiency of natural gas and other
fuel use in New Mexico through programs, funds, and/or requirements. The options for pursuing
natural gas efficiency savings are similar in nature to those described for electricity efficiency in
option RCI-1 above. As in RCI-1, two key and linked dimensions are achievable/desirable
energy savings and policy/administrative mechanisms to achieve those savings. Under the
recommended policy, investment in natural gas efficiency programs rises to the level needed
capture the state’s full, achievable energy efficiency potential , which is currently estimated to be
an approximately a 1.16% reduction in total natural gas demand each year (relative to baseline
levels). This savings level can be achieved by increasing investment in energy efficiency to the
level of about 2.2% of gas utility revenues by 2012. This spending level exceeds the base level
1.5% of utility revenues currently allowed under the recent Efficient Use of Energy Act.
Implementation of this policy will require a combination of revising existing statutes to enable
investment spending sufficient to reach savings goals, and to consider as potentially eligible
programs that are cost-effective even taking into the valuation of CO2 emissions. Additional
policy and administrative mechanisms to be used might include regulator-verified savings
targets, public benefit charges, portfolio standards, “energy trusts”, integrated resource planning,
performance-based incentives, decoupling of rates and revenues, appropriate rate treatment for
efficiency, and/or others. These mechanisms above are offered as options to be considered.
RCI-3: Regional Market Transformation Alliance
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico work with other states in the region and nongovernmental organizations to form a regional market transformation organization, modeled on
the successful Northwest Energy Efficiency Alliance (NEEA), as recommended by the WGA
CDEAC EE Task Force, and to pursue other regional efforts that use voluntary efforts
implemented by non-utility organizations to encourage greater uptake by consumers (residential,
commercial, and industrial, as well as the professionals that service energy-using equipment) of
cost-effective energy conservation practices.
This organization would be a useful complement to the electricity and natural gas efficiency
options RCI-1and RCI-2. Such an organization could focus on products and sectors (such as
evaporative swamp coolers or formation of energy service companies) in a manner that could
complement what utilities would otherwise be providing through their efficiency programs. It is
recommended that the organization be set up by 2008, and fully implemented by 2010
RCI-4: State Appliance Standards
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should adopt more stringent appliance efficiency
standards. Appliance efficiency standards reduce the market cost of energy efficiency
improvements by incorporating technological advances into base appliance models, thereby
creating economies of scale. This policy option involves the replication of standards first
adopted in nearby states (such as California) for appliances not covered by federal standards. It
also involves the State, together with other Western states, advocating for stronger federal
appliance efficiency standards where this is technically feasible and economically justified. New
standards should come into force in 2007/2008 for standards already implemented by nearby
states, and following by 6 months to 1 year future adoption in nearby states of standards for
4-9

additional appliance/equipment and/or more stringent energy-efficiency requirements for
appliances and equipment now included in standards.
RCI-5: Green Power Purchasing
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should expand implement and promote its green
power purchasing. This option comprises a variety of consumer-driven strategies to increase the
production and delivery of low-GHG power sources, above and beyond levels achieved through
Renewable Portfolio Standards and other mandatory programs. Green power, as defined here,
includes power from renewable energy technologies recognized by the state Renewable Portfolio
Standard.
This policy involves the following components:
•

The Public Regulatory Commission (PRC) should consider adopting and encouraging
utilities to develop green power tariff structures that a) enable "quantity savings" for large
purchases. (such as Pacificorp’s Blue Sky QS program) ; b) are stable thus avoiding the
volatility associated with standard rates due to fluctuating gas or other fuel prices (such as
Austin Energy’s program); and c) are based on cost-of-service principles.

•

The PRC would also provide for the reporting power sources and emissions data in consumer
bills.

•

The State should set a goal that, by 2010, a minimum total of 30% of electricity should come
from green power purchases or the renewable fraction of standard purchased electricity,
possibly modeled on the federal purchasing requirements in EPACT 2005. This goal would
apply to all non-federal government buildings, including local government, public schools,
and public universities.

•

The State and other entities should also promote voluntary purchasing of green power
(through provision of information and promotional materials).

The CCAG recommends that this policy start in 2010, with goals reviewed every 5 years. The
CCAG suggests that programs and goals for local governments might be phased in more slowly
than for state government power purchasers.
RCI-6: Rate Design (Including Time of Use Rates, Increasing Block Rates, and Seasonal
Use Rates)
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico utilities should propose, and the state regulatory
commission should adopt, rate designs that promote reduction in GHG emissions and/or
improvements in energy efficiency. This option includes reducing customer charges,
discouraging existing decreasing block rates, pursuing peak season surcharge rates, and
encouraging the use of steep increasing block rates for appropriate customer classes as a means
reducing GHG emissions through promotion of energy efficiency. It will be important to
consider interaction with potential efforts to decouple utility revenues from levels of sales (see
RCI-1 and RCI-2), and to ensure that higher marginal electricity costs do not lead consumers to
switch to other, more GHG-intensive energy.

4-10

RCI-7A: Improved Building Codes
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should upgrade the energy-efficiency provisions of its
building codes. Building energy codes specify minimum energy efficiency requirements for new
buildings or for existing buildings undergoing a major renovation. As energy use (largely
electricity and gas) in buildings in New Mexico accounts for about 36 percent of current
emissions, amending the existing New Mexico Building Codes will have a considerable
immediate impact towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. An ongoing process of
code amendments for new and renovated residential and commercial buildings is recommended
by the CCAG, and includes the following aspects:
•

Building codes will be amended to reduce the building energy needs in areas including but
not limited to HVAC systems, daylighting design to reduce lighting needs, electric lighting
design, building envelope design, using integrated building design strategies.

•

New Mexico should update its energy codes regularly. A three-year cycle could be timed to
coincide with release of national model codes. Local adoption of new statewide codes
should occur within 6 months of statewide code adoption.

•

New Mexico should adopt innovative features building energy codes in other states that go
beyond the IECC codes in force, as appropriate to conditions in New Mexico.

•

To mitigate the problem of rapid growth in the number of homes using energy intensive,
compressor-based cooling systems for central air conditioning (CAC) in lieu of the
traditional evaporative cooler , building codes should include a combination of offsetting
measures for any newly constructed or renovated home that includes CAC.

•

By 2010, buildings in New Mexico should be required to consume 50 percent less energy per
square foot than average US buildings, as reflected in the most recently available information
on similar building types (on a climate-adjusted basis).

•

Building professionals, including building inspectors, should be provided with training in the
use of analytical and design tools that allow building energy performance to be estimated in
the design phase, so that compliance with energy performance codes can be tested.

•

After 2010, the required percentage improvement in energy performance should be reviewed
every 3 years and updated through a combination of codes revision and legislative action
based on consideration of new developments in building energy efficiency, national and
international energy codes, New Mexico state targets for reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions, and the overall goal that buildings be “carbon neutral” by 2030.

•

New Mexico should join a regional “Building Energy Codes Collaborative”, as
recommended by the WGA.

RCI-7B: Solar Hot Water-ready and Solar-PV-ready Codes for New Buildings
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should modify building energy codes to require new
residential buildings and new commercial buildings to be configured for, and to include
plumbing and wiring for mounting and installation of, solar hot water heaters and solar
photovoltaic (PV) panels.
Amending building energy codes to take advantage of the very good solar resource found in
most of New Mexico, this policy would specify that all new buildings, as applicable, would be

4-11

required to be built so as to accommodate systems for solar water heat, and would also be
required to be built “solar PV ready”, that is, designed to have solar PV systems mounted in an
unobstructed location, and including wiring and other facilities for mounting and connecting
solar PV systems to the building’s electricity system and, as applicable, to the local power grid.
These codes will apply to major renovations as well as new buildings, but exceptions to the
“solar-ready” building code requirements may be granted when applicable. Solar-ready building
code requirements should be implemented on the same schedule as the building energy codes
revisions in RCI-7A.
RCI-7C: Solar Hot Water Systems as an Element of Building Codes for New Buildings
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should modify building energy codes to require new
residential buildings and new commercial buildings with substantial water heat demand to install
solar water heaters. This requirement would apply to builders of speculative construction (buyer
unknown) unless the builder can show that there is a more cost-effective option for providing hot
water. Builders of non-speculative construction (buyer known) would be required to offer solar
hot water to the prospective buyer, with the buyer making the choice of whether to have solar hot
water installed.
Amending building energy codes to take advantage of the very good solar resource found in
most of New Mexico, this policy would specify that all new buildings, and buildings undergoing
major renovations, would, as applicable, and with appropriate exclusions, limitations, and
alternatives, be required to implement solar water heat.
Solar hot water building code requirements should be implemented on the same schedule as the
building energy codes revisions in RCI-7A.
RCI-8A: Building Energy Performance Requirements for State-funded and Other
Government Buildings (“Reach Codes”)
The CCAG recommends that the New Mexico State Government provide leadership in moving
the State toward a stock of buildings with much higher energy efficiency by the example of
requiring all new state- and state-funded government buildings to meet increasingly stringent
energy performance and renewable energy use standards.
New Mexico sets as its goal that all buildings be “carbon neutral” by 2030, meaning that any
energy needs in a building, net of efficiency gains through building design to reduce energy use
and of on-site renewable energy use, should be supplied by renewable energy sources (“green
power”). The CCAG recommends that building energy performance standards should be
implemented in State-funded government buildings, including the Higher Education Department,
such that new buildings achieve high standards of energy efficiency, and existing buildings are
retrofitted to yield significant energy efficiency improvements.
Specifically, it is recommended:
•

That all State-funded new buildings and building renovation projects of 5,000 square feet and
above and/or using over 50 kW electrical demand are mandated to build to a minimum rating
of "Silver" using the U.S. Green Building Council's LEED-NC™, LEED-EB™, LEEDCS™, or LEED-CI™ rating system - or verifiable equivalent - in effect as of the project
registration date by 2007.

4-12

•

In addition to achieving one of the ratings above, or their equivalent, state-funded buildings
and building renovations must achieve at least an 50% reduction in energy use on a weathernormalized per-square-foot basis relative to average buildings of the same type in the US, as
determined by modeling . Additionally, requirements for the minimum delivered fossil fuel
energy consumption performance standard shall be increased to 60% reduction in 2010; 70%
in 2015; 80% in 2020; 90% in 2025 and to “carbon neutral” (as defined above) in 2030. No
more than 25% of the building’s reduction goal may be met through the use of off-site green
power. These requirements would be reviewed every three years.

•

Modify the State procurement processes to facilitate reaching the requirements above.

•

Whenever possible, design and build State-funded and other Government buildings
incorporating features designed not only to reduce energy use within the buildings, but to
reduce energy use in the surrounding community through incorporation of considerations of
transport access, the availability of necessary commercial services, and other aspects of
community life that affect energy use.

•

Carry out starting in 2007, and completed by 2010, a program to audit energy use and energy
efficiency opportunities in State buildings.

RCI-8B: Building Energy Performance Promotion and Incentives for Energy Performance
Enhancements (Attaining “Reach Codes”) in Non-Government Buildings (Including
Existing Buildings)
The CCAG recommends that energy efficiency in existing buildings and in non-governmentfunded new buildings in New Mexico should be substantially improved, and use of renewable
energy expanded, through a combination of financial incentives, education and information
resources, and technical assistance. The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should develop
policies and programs to promote and implement in new and existing non-State public and
private buildings, on a voluntary basis, energy “reach codes”. “Reach codes” are higher-thanprevailing-code energy performance levels for buildings, which are suggested to be mandated for
state-owned and state-funded buildings under Policy Option RCI-8A, above. Specifically, it is
recommended to:
•

Create a “high performance buildings” initiative that provides incentives, technical support,
and other assistance to induce private developers of commercial new buildings and building
renovation projects to meet the same requirements of proposed policy 8A, above.

•

Include a residential program in the “high performance buildings” initiative that provides
incentives for private developers, including designers, developers, and builders of residential
and manufactured housing. The program requirements would have the same energy goals as
those for commercial buildings.

•

Provide incentives for the undertaking of substantial building energy efficiency measures and
retrofits in existing buildings (including manufactured housing).

•

Provide incentives and other support to encourage non-government buildings to be designed
and built, and, where applicable, retrofitted, so as to incorporate features designed not only to
reduce energy use within the buildings, but to reduce energy use in the surrounding
community.

4-13

•

Provide incentives and other support to encourage residential and commercial-sector
consumers to switch to the use of less carbon-intensive fuels to provide key energy services.

RCI-9: Government Agency Requirements and Goals (including procurement) -- Focus on
Operations
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should improve the efficiency of energy use in
existing government buildings and other facilities by emphasizing energy efficiency as a
criterion in procurement of energy-using equipment and systems, and in the improvement in
operation of buildings and other facilities. Municipal Energy Management systems and
initiatives, as well as audits of energy performance and operations of State and other government
buildings (in tandem with the audit program proposed in RCI-8A), are included as elements of
this policy. Audit results will be used to target and prioritize investments in improving
government building energy efficiency. It is recommended that the infrastructure for
implementation (meters, bookkeeping systems, staff, etc.) be established as soon as possible so
as to be able to report results in 2009, and implement improvements starting in 2010.
RCI-10: Education and Outreach for Building Professionals
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should require specific and targeted education,
outreach, and licensing requirements for professionals in a variety of building-related trades.
The building code improvement and building energy efficiency options described above depend
for their effectiveness on the availability of trained, committed design, construction, and
operations professionals to make sure that buildings are designed, constructed, and run so as to
make those buildings as energy-efficient as possible within the restrictions of their function.
The CCAG finds that a combination of education of and outreach to building professionals is
needed to make sure that as many of those professionals as possible incorporate energyefficiency and greenhouse gas emissions-reduction considerations as they do their jobs.
Specifically, it is recommended that:
•

Mandate that State Boards of Licensing for building professionals cover in licensing exams
knowledge of the improved building codes and building energy performance requirements
reflected in policy options RCI-7A, -7B, and -7C, as well as RCI-8A and RCI-8B.

•

Implement code training and technical assistance for architects, builders, and local code
inspectors.

•

Implement programs to train builders and contractors on proper heating and air conditioning
sizing and installation.

•

Train commercial building energy managers, for example by making use of the building
operator training and certification program developed in the Pacific Northwest.

•

Train industrial energy and facility managers in techniques for improving the efficiency of
their steam, process heat, pumping, compressed air, motors, and other systems, partnering
with the U.S. DOE in doing so.

•

As appropriate and applicable for each professional discipline, include training and outreach
to encourage design of energy-efficient communities.

•

The implementation of these actions should be timed as required to support other buildingsrelated policies recommended by the CCAG.

4-14

RCI-11: Consumer Education Programs, and RCI-12: Increased Emphasis on Energy and
Environmental Consideration in Higher Education (option shared with CC-3)
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico lead by example in its own education and outreach
activities by establishing a pro-active public education and outreach capability, and using it to
target education and outreach activities to five specific audiences:
•

Policymakers (legislators, regulators, executive branch, agencies) – because implementation
of climate actions hinges on policymakers’ approval.

•

Younger Generations – by integrating climate change into educational curricula, postsecondary degree programs, and professional licensing programs.

•

Community Leaders & Community-Based Organizations (e.g., institutions, municipalities,
service clubs, social & affinity groups, non-governmental organizations, etc.) – in order to
recognize leadership; share success stories and role models; and expand climate involvement
and participation within civic society.

•

General Public – to increase awareness and engage citizens in climate actions in their
personal and professional lives.

•

Industrial and Economic Sectors – in order to recognize leadership; share success stories and
role models; and expand climate involvement and participation within the business
community.

Specific public education and outreach efforts suggested for these policies are provided in
Appendix F under “CC-3 State Climate Public Education and Outreach”.
RCI-13: Incentives and Promotion for Renewable Energy and Clean Combined Heat and
Power
The CCAG supports this option, as addressed by the Energy Supply options ES-2, ES-4,
and ES-8.
RCI-14: Regulatory/Legislative Grid, Pricing, and other Policies to Support Distributed
Generation
The CCAG supports this option, as addressed by the Energy Supply options ES-2, ES-4,
and ES-8.
RCI-16: Participation in Regional (or National) Industry Emissions Cap and Trade
Programs
The CCAG supports this option, as addressed by the Energy Supply option ES-14.
RCI-17: Voluntary Emissions Targets
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should work with industrial and other large users of
energy (and/or of process gases that are greenhouse gases) to encourage those organizations to
set emissions reduction targets. Fuel-switching, where applicable, may be used as a means of
emissions reduction. This recommendation may be implemented through a combination of
financial and other incentives, public-private partnerships and agreements, provision of
information and technical assistance, and other methods.

4-15

Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved in the industrial sector through energy
efficiency, process changes, and/or switching to the use of less carbon-intensive fuels to provide
key energy services. Fuel switching opportunities can include using natural gas in the place of
electricity for thermal end-uses, natural gas in the place of coal for key industrial end-uses,
biomass fuels in the place of electricity or natural gas for thermal end-uses, and solar thermal
energy in the place of electricity or natural gas for thermal end-uses. As a goal for this option,
industrial sector entities (other than fossil fuel industries) would be encouraged to establish and
meet emission goals that meet or exceed the overall state goal for reduction of GHG emissions
(that is, return to 2000 emission levels by 2012, and move to 10% below 2000 levels by 2020).
RCI-18: Use of Alternative Gases (Non-Energy Emissions, Industrial Process Gases)
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should reduce HFC emissions through leakage
management efforts and the substitution of HFCs with lower-GWP refrigerants, including lowerGWP HFCs, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons (HCs - propane or isobutene/propane blend).
Many of these opportunities lie in the transportation sector (mobile air conditioning). For the
RCI sector, the adoption of specifications for new commercial refrigeration is recommended.
These specifications could limit the global warming potential of refrigerants used in refrigerators
in retail food stores, restaurants, and refrigerated transport vehicles (trucks and railcars) and/or
require that centralized systems with large refrigerant charges and long distribution lines be
avoided in favor of systems that use much less refrigerant and lack long distribution lines.
Another suggestion for implementation of this policy is that the state could “lead by example” by
implementing such improvements in relevant state facilities. In addition, the State should
continue to monitor and review approaches that the Federal Government and other jurisdictions
are taking toward the regulation of HFCs and similar substances, including consideration of
whether the use and emissions of HFCs can be regulated under the laws of the State of New
Mexico.
RCI-19: Solid Waste Recycling, Source Reduction, and Composting
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico undertake efforts to increase recycling, composting
and other waste management activities. Legislative efforts to require recycling by businesses
and individuals and/or to provide grant and staffing support to the Solid Waste Bureau may be
essential to significantly increase the state recycling rate, which is currently 3%. This rate falls
well short of the state’s recycling (diversion) goals. The current manpower and financial tools
available to the Solid Waste Bureau are insufficient to achieve significant improvements.
Several states and municipalities have used mandatory recycling as a means to achieve more
ambitious recycling goals.
In terms of financial and technical support to recycling programs, it is recommended that the NM
legislature provide: a) an adequate budget recharge to the Solid Waste Facility Grant Fund (to
support a range of solid waste activities and investments); b) appropriations for a grant/loan
program to be used for hazardous, e-waste, recycling and diversion programs; c) expanding (to
previous levels) SWB staffing to provide more technical assistance/consulting into the field.
To achieve a more significant change in New Mexico's recycling rate, the state Solid Waste Act
would likely need to be amended to enable local governments to implement mandatory recycling
programs. Any mandated program would need to ensure adequate funding and access to markets
for recycled materials.

Chapter 5
Energy Supply
Overview of GHG Emissions
GHG emissions from the Energy Supply (ES) sector in New Mexico include emissions from
electricity generation and the fossil fuel industry (i.e., oil, natural gas, and coal) and comprise a
substantial majority of the State’s overall GHG emissions (approximately 64% of gross
emissions in 2000). New Mexico GHG emissions are proportionally greater than many states
because New Mexico is an energy exporter, of both electric and fossil fuel energy. Roughly twothirds of the State’s fossil fuel emissions are associated with exports. Slightly less than half of
New Mexico’s electric generation emissions are associated with exports, though this is expected
to decline to less than one-third by 2020 based on the CCAG reference case forecast. Overall, by
2020 Energy Supply emissions are expected to increase from 1990 levels by approximately 32%
on a production basis with the fossil fuel industry somewhat outpacing electric generation in
increased GHG emissions due to increasing demand for natural gas. Due to continued growth in
the State, emissions reflecting energy consumed in New Mexico (rather than exported to other
states) are anticipated to rise approximately 63% over 1990 levels by 2020, with electric
generation emissions increasing more than fossil fuel emissions.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
There are two primary challenges in addressing GHG emissions from New Mexico’s Energy
Supply sector: continued growth within the State and ever-higher demand from other states for
New Mexico’s energy products. These challenges are compounded by significant uncertainties,
including whether natural gas production in the State will remain relatively flat through 2020 due
to intensified exploration efforts and unconventional recovery techniques, or whether it will
decline as natural gas fields in the State are tapped out. A second key uncertainty is associated
with increasing electricity consumption: Will New Mexico simply reduce power exports in
order to meet its growing domestic need, or will it retain its presence as a major energy exporter
by bringing new electric generating facilities on line? New Mexico may face an additional
challenge in reducing GHG emissions from the power sector because generating facilities in the
State are subject to substantially different oversight regimes depending on whether they are
regulated by the Public Regulation Commission (e.g., PNM), overseen by their own elected
board (e.g., rural electric cooperatives), or are located on tribal lands (e.g., the Four Corners
Power Plant). This disparity may make broad adoption of some of the CCAG’s
recommendations more difficult. In order to facilitate calculations and provide a complete
statewide picture, quantification of costs and GHG reductions for ES measures includes tribally
operated facilities and electric cooperatives.
Fortunately, there are significant opportunities to reduce GHG emissions growth attributable to
energy production and supply, including diminishing the carbon intensity of electrical generation
through greater use of renewable energy options and recapture of waste energy through

5-2

combined heat and power and other technologies. Where actions are both technically and
economically feasible, natural gas producers and processors can benefit from the fact that steps
which reduce methane venting, leaks, or combustion – of which there are many – enable more
product to come to the market, producing a genuine win-win situation. Significant opportunities
to reduce GHG emissions through policies addressing electricity consumption also exist and can
often provide cost savings. The CCAG has identified several demand-side management, energy
efficiency, and conservation measures in the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sector;
these are detailed in Chapter 4.
New Mexico has plentiful renewable resources in the form solar and wind energy, and due to the
State’s long history as an energy pioneer, unusual human resources to capitalize on these
resources. This offers the State a significant leadership opportunity in the commercialization of
associated technologies. New Mexico also has untapped wind resources, albeit not necessarily
well located to meet domestic demand. Wind’s intermittency inhibits its value for baseload
capacity, but its value to the electricity grid can be enhanced by carefully planning wind facilities
at multiple sites

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The CCAG recommends a set of 17 policy options for the Energy Supply sector that offer the
potential for significant GHG emission reductions. These recommendations can be grouped into
those affecting electricity supply (ES-1 through ES-10 and ES-14 through ES-16) and those
affecting oil and gas operations (ES-11 through ES-13).
The electricity supply recommendations include efforts to increase the supply of renewable
energy (ES-1B and C, 2, 4), encourage lower-emitting fossil fuel generation (ES-6), reduce the
average emissions of new utility resource acquisitions (ES-15), increase distributed generation
(ES-8) and reduce demand. A glance at the numbers in Table 5-1 would seem to suggest that if
simply added together, cumulative emission reductions of these policies could exceed 100
MMtCO2 in 2020 and NPV costs could exceed $1 billion, assuming all options are implemented
in isolation from each other. However, these options are not additive. In fact, they tend to
overlap heavily, so simply adding them would introduce significant double-counting. These
options essentially target – through different means – the avoidance of the same or similar
emissions sources (e.g., the emissions from fossil-fuel power plants existing and yet to be built).
When taken together in a combined scenario that assumes all of the CCAG’s recommendations
are fully implemented, these electricity supply recommendations are estimated to lead to
cumulative GHG emissions reductions of about 39 MMtCO2e through 2020 at a cost of about
$258 million. (See Appendix H for discussion of the methodology used for the integrated
analysis.)
In fact, the CCAG’s policy recommendations concerning GHG emissions from electric
generation are highly interactive with its RCI policy recommendations that concern electricity
use, because reducing electricity demand can offset the need for new generation, often at a lower
cost or even with a savings. The scenario above (full implementation of all CCAG
recommendations) takes into account the many overlaps among Energy Supply and RCI policy
5-3

options that reduce the demand for power. Overall, the combined Energy Supply and RCI
recommendations yield potential reductions in electricity sector emissions from reference case
projections of 13 MMtCO2e per year by 2020 and cumulative reductions of almost 83 MMtCO2e
from 2007 through 2020, at a net savings of approximately $128 million through the year 2020
on an NPV basis. These combined Energy Supply and RCI results are shown in Figures 5-3 and
5-4. 1
As shown in Figure 5-5, the CCAG policy recommendations concerning GHG emissions from
operations in the oil and gas industry could potentially reduce as much as 7.8 MMtCO2e per year
by 2020 and 71 MMtCO2e from 2007 through 2020. Overall, the weighted average cost of
carbon reductions from the Energy Supply policy options for which quantitative estimates of
both costs and savings were prepared (which did not include oil and gas options 2 ) was less than
$7 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent (after eliminating potentially overlapping options).

The estimated impacts of the recommended Energy Supply policies are shown in Table 5-1. The
CCAG policy recommendations described briefly here (and in more detail in Appendix H to this
Report) result not only in significant emissions savings, but offer significant additional benefits
as well. A substantial expansion of renewable energy in New Mexico, for instance, may be
accompanied by a corresponding increase in related jobs in New Mexico as energy investment
shifts from fuel production to the manufacture of renewable technologies on a relative basis.
Leadership in commercializing renewable technologies would also contribute to the growth and
influence of New Mexico-based companies serving markets elsewhere. Energy reliability and
security could be enhanced by greater penetration of distributed and renewable energy resources,
as would public health and visibility as a function of reduced fossil fuel-fired emissions.

Energy Supply Sector
Policy Descriptions

The Energy Supply sector includes emissions mitigation opportunities related to electricity
generation and oil and gas production. Electrical energy options include mitigation activities
associated with the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, whether generated
through the combustion of fossil fuels or by renewable energy sources; in a centralized power
station supplying the grid or by distributed generation facilities; or in the case of some options,
within New Mexico or imported into the state. Oil and gas mitigation options include mitigation
activities associated with the extraction, transportation, and processing of oil and natural gas.
Sequestration options can apply to both electrical generation and oil and gas production.
ES-1 Mandate(s) for Renewable Energy (RPS, etc.)
A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) is a requirement that utilities acquire a certain percentage
of electricity from renewable energy sources. Utilities can meet this requirement by purchasing
or generating renewable-based electricity or by purchasing renewable energy credits (RECs).
The CCAG unanimously recommends that New Mexico reduce the carbon intensity of its
electricity generation by increasing its existing 10% Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) by 1%
annually over the period 2011-2021, applicable to all load serving entities. As a stand-alone
policy, this measure would reduce New Mexico’s GHG emissions relative to reference case
levels by approximately 2.6 MMTCO2e by 2020. A majority of the CCAG also supports a
more-rapid 2% annual increase in the RPS over 2011-2021.
ES-2 Financial Incentives for Distributed Renewables
This policy option reflects financial incentives to encourage investment in distributed
renewables. These financial incentives for distributed renewables include (1) direct subsidies for
purchasing/selling distributed renewable technologies given to the buyer; 3 (2) tax credits or
exemptions for purchasing distributed renewable technologies given to the buyer, and (3)
regulatory policies that provide incentives and/or assurance of cost recovery for utilities that
invest in customer-owned renewable energy systems. The policy also includes R&D funding to
support development of distributed renewable technologies. R&D funding could be targeted
toward a particular technology or group of technologies as part of a state program with a mission
to build an industry around that technology in the state and/or to set the stage for adoption of the
technology for use in the state. R&D funding could also be made available to any renewable or
other advanced technology through an open bidding procedure (i.e., driven by bids received
rather than by a focused strategy to develop a particular technology). Funding can also be given

for demonstration projects to help commercialize technologies that have already been developed
but are not yet in widespread use. New Mexico has been striving toward capital buy downs and
production incentives such that there is full payback over 25-30 years to those who install
distributed renewable options. Additionally, Albuquerque is considering tax incentives for
distributed renewables.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico offer incentives for distributed solar photovoltaic
(PV) technologies in order to reduce their payback period to 25 years or less. 4 Very-low-carbon
PV generation would displace generation from fossil fuels and correspondingly lower carbon
emissions more than otherwise would be the case.
ES-3 Renewable Energy Transmission and Storage
Renewable energy from wind and solar radiation is intermittent by nature, while fossil fuel
technologies can be called upon to meet demand as needed. A renewable energy transmission
authority (RETA) could be created to assist in the development of energy storage technologies
and to foster the development of transmission capacity necessary to take advantage of renewable
resources.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico legislatively establish a Renewable Energy
Transmission Authority (RETA) charged with overcoming limitations on renewable energy by
fostering the development of (a) renewable energy storage technologies to address intermittency,
and (b) transmission capacity necessary to take advantage of available renewable resources.
Creation of a RETA as recommended in this non-quantified enabling policy could enhance the
penetration of renewable energy resources and contribute to the success of other CCAGrecommended policies. A first step has already been taken in this direction via the introduction
of HB111 in the New Mexico Legislature in 2006.
ES-4 Financial Incentives for Centralized Renewables
This policy option reflects a suite of financial incentives to encourage investment in centralized
renewables. Financial incentives for centralized renewables could include: (1) direct subsidies
for purchasing/selling centralized renewable technologies given to the buyer/seller; (2) tax
credits or exemptions for purchasing/selling centralized renewable technologies given to the
buyer/seller; (3) tax credits or exemptions for operating centralized renewable energy facilities;
(4) feed-in tariff, which is a direct payment to centralized renewable generators for each kWh of
electricity generated from a qualifying renewable facility; (5) tax credits for each kWh generated
from a qualifying renewable facility; (6) regulatory policies that provide financial incentives
through favorable rate treatment to regulated utilities that invest in centralized merchant or
utility-built renewable energy projects; and (7) R&D funding to support development of
centralized renewable technologies. Incentives could also be linked to or made conditional upon
in-state manufacturing of equipment. This policy could also be linked with other carbon policies
in order to make them more effective. For example, financial incentives could be provided in
conjunction with an RPS in order to (a) provide long-term financial support for renewable
developers, (b) help ensure that aggressive levels of renewable generation can be achieved in
practice, and (c) provide financial support for certain renewable technologies that would not
otherwise be developed.
4

Any direct subsidies or incentives would need to be cleared through the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office to
ensure that they comport with the anti-donation clause of the New Mexico Constitution.

5-9

The CCAG recommends that New Mexico implement production tax incentives for centralized
renewable energy of 4¢/kWh for solar, 2¢/kWh for biomass, and 1¢/kWh for wind. These
incentives would likely be implemented in conjunction with an RPS, so for the purposes of
modeling this policy option, it was assumed that these financial incentives are combined with an
RPS that increases the existing New Mexico RPS targets by 2% per year from 2010 to 2020.
The State should also eliminate the existing 2 million MWH/year overall cap on this incentive;
lower the facility size threshold from 10 MW to 1 MW, and extend the tax credit to apply to
personal income taxes as well as corporate income taxes.
ES-5 Research & Development (R&D)
R&D funding can be targeted toward a particular technology or group of technologies as part of
a state program to build an industry around those technologies in the state and/or to set the stage
for adoption of those technologies in the state. Funding can also be given for demonstration
projects to help commercialize technologies that have already been developed but are not yet in
widespread use.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico establish an R&D program tasked with the
development and deployment of concentrating solar energy technologies, hydrogen-based energy
storage technologies, and other energy storage technologies such as compressed air storage,
molten salt storage, and cavern storage. This is a non-quantified enabling policy to assist in the
achievement of GHG emission reductions though other CCAG-recommended policy options.
ES-6 Advanced Coal/Fossil Technologies (e.g., IGCC with carbon capture)
Advanced fossil technologies such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) may offer
greater efficiency than conventional fossil technologies, and can therefore have lower CO2
emission rates. Advanced fossil technologies combined with carbon capture and sequestration or
reuse (CCSR) could enable significantly lower CO2 emissions. Policies to promote advanced
fossil technologies for new coal plants may include mandates, incentives, or a combination of the
two.
The CCAG recommends that the State encourage all new coal plants in New Mexico, or serving
customers in New Mexico, to be built with advanced fossil technologies and CCSR. Because
development of an IGCC plant involves risks and uncertainties that have inhibited rapid
commercialization, the CCAG recommends an incentive-based approach rather than a mandate.
Accordingly, the CCAG recommends that the state develop an incentive package to encourage
utilities and independent power producers to develop advanced fossil technologies with CCSR.
Incentives should be structured to encourage high rates of CCSR (e.g., net CO2 emission rates no
higher than those of a state-of-the-art natural gas combined-cycle generation facility) and should
only be offered for advanced fossil technologies with CCSR. Cost recovery for prudent utility
investments in advanced fossil technologies with CCSR should be structured to fully compensate
utilities. The CCAG also recommends that New Mexico task a state agency (e.g., New Mexico
Oil Conservation Division (NMOCD), which has this regulatory authority) to provide technical
resources for carbon sequestration, including an evaluation of suitable storage sites, and possibly
the administration of incentives.
ES-7 Nuclear Power
The production of electric power in nuclear fission reactors creates little direct GHG emissions.
In states with existing nuclear facilities, relicensing can extend their productive life, and uprating

5-10

can enable more power to be generated, typically by improvements to the steam side of the
operation. New Mexico has no existing commercial nuclear power plants to relicense or uprate,
however, so its nuclear options are limited to whether or not new nuclear generation capacity
should be built.
In evaluating nuclear power options, it is important to consider costs beyond the direct costs for
generation, operation, waste storage, and decommissioning. The costs of the unusual risks
associated with nuclear power, including taxpayer assumption of reinsurance liability under the
Price-Anderson Act and new security costs, should also be considered. At the same time, in the
interest of completeness, it is important to include new nuclear capacity as an option. To do
otherwise could suggest that the CCAG was inadequately comprehensive in its consideration of
available electricity supply alternatives.
Given the highly controversial nature of fission-based nuclear power in the U.S., the CCAG
recommends that New Mexico consider whether new nuclear generation capacity is advisable for
the State following a qualitative but comprehensive review of all direct and indirect benefits and
costs associated with nuclear power. This review should expand upon and include uranium
miner safety, environmental contamination from uranium mining, internal nuclear plant safety
and security, the safety of surrounding communities in the event of an accidental release of
radioactive materials, environmental contamination in the event of an accidental release of
radioactive materials, environmental contamination from both on-site and permanent storage of
nuclear waste, environmental contamination from possible reprocessing of nuclear waste, and
enhanced nuclear weapons proliferation risk due to exercise of the nuclear power option in the
U.S. The CCAG decided not to quantify this policy option, lacking a basis to do so until such a
comprehensive review is completed.
ES-8 Incentives and Barrier Reductions for Combined Heat & Power (CHP)
Financial incentives for combined heat & power (CHP) could include: (1) direct subsidies for
purchasing/selling CHP systems given to the buyer/seller; 5 (2) tax credits or exemptions for
purchasing/selling CHP systems given to the buyer/seller; (3) tax credits or exemptions for
operating CHP systems; (4) feed-in tariff, which is a direct payment to CHP owners for each
kWh of electricity or BTU of heat generated from a qualifying CHP system; and (5) tax credits
for each kWh or BTU generated from a qualifying CHP system. There are also numerous
barriers to greater penetration of combined heat and power (CHP), including inadequate
information, institutional barriers, high transaction costs because of small projects, high
financing costs because of lender unfamiliarity and perceived risk, "split incentives" between
building owners and tenants, and utility-related policies like interconnection requirement, high
standby rates, exit fees, etc. The lack of standard offer or long-term contracts, payment at
avoided cost levels, prohibitions on running private wires, and lack of recognition for emissions
reduction value provided also creates obstacles.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico undertake a concerted effort to revise its policies in
order to remove or reduce barriers to CHP and the recovery and use of currently wasted energy. 6
For the purpose of modeling, this policy option assumed that 2-3% of the estimated CHP

Any direct subsidies or incentives would need to be cleared through the New Mexico Attorney General’s Office to
ensure that they comport with the anti-donation clause of the New Mexico Constitution.

New Mexico may wish to review similar policy changes recently enacted in Connecticut, Vermont, Pennsylvania,
Nevada, and Rhode Island.

potential in New Mexico could be realized each year from 2008 onward. The potential for these
energy sources is estimated to be about 650 MW.
ES-9 Demand-Side Management, Energy Efficiency, and Integrated Resource Planning
This policy option involves increasing the efficiency of electricity use in New Mexico through
programs, funds, and/or requirements focusing on demand-side management (DSM) activities.
This option is designed to work in tandem with other strategies that the CCAG has recommended
that also encourage efficiency gains. Many different policy configurations are possible, 7
including various combinations of energy savings targets, utility spending targets, public benefit
charges, 8 tariff riders or enabling legislation (recently enacted in NM), and incorporation of
energy efficiency in integrated resource planning (IRP) processes, among others.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico’s DSM, energy efficiency, and IRP policies go
beyond what is currently cost-effective to include measures that would be cost-effective when an
appropriate value for carbon dioxide emissions is included (i.e., a “carbon adder”), which should
lead to larger GHG emission reductions. This policy option echoes and is quantified under
policy option RCI-1, Demand-Side Management and Energy Efficiency Programs.
ES-10 Transmission Capacity and Corridors
Satisfying the long-term demand for electricity requires not only new generating capacity, along
with demand-side measures, but also measures to improve transmission in order to reduce line
losses, diminish bottlenecks, and enhance throughput. Advanced composite conductor
technologies, capacitance technologies, grid management software, and other technologies may
soon become available to increase transmission line carrying capacity as much as threefold.
Entirely new transmission lines may also be necessary, although siting new transmission lines
can be difficult due to their cost and their actual or perceived impact on health, environment, and
the use, enjoyment, and value of property.
The CCAG recommends that when new construction, repairs and upgrades of existing
transmission and distribution infrastructure in New Mexico are undertaken, transmission-owning
entities should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of incorporating advanced composite conductor
technologies, capacitance technologies, grid management software, and other technologies to
increase throughput capacity on the grid. The CCAG further recommends that these evaluations
take into account reductions in GHG emissions that would result from energy saved due to lower
line losses. This policy option was not quantified due to significant cost uncertainties and the
uncertain applicability of advanced transmission technologies to New Mexico’s electric grid
ES-11 CO2 Capture and Storage or Reuse (CCSR)
Carbon capture and storage or reuse (CCSR) involves capturing carbon and either (1)
sequestering it in a geologically sound reservoir or (2) reusing the carbon dioxide to aid in oil
extraction or as a feedstock for industrial processes, and perhaps someday as a feedstock that
when combined with water could be reformed into liquid fuels. Carbon dioxide can be (and
sometimes is being) captured in natural gas extraction. CO2 in commercial natural gas is capped

Public benefit charge funds are in place in about 15 states, typically adopted as part of electricity restructuring
policy/legislation. These funds are collected as surcharge on utility bills, and are typically directed to a mix of
energy efficiency, renewable energy, and low-income programs.

5-12

at 2.5%, and some gas fields have a much higher concentration. Excess CO2 is removed through
processing and currently emitted to the atmosphere. Carbon can also be captured in the process
of gasifying coal to liquid fuels. This process is well established in the chemical industry and
forms the basis for IGCC electric generating plants.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico task a state agency (e.g., NMOCD, which has this
regulatory authority) to provide technical resources for carbon sequestration, including an
evaluation of suitable storage sites, evaluating the technical and economic feasibility of capture
and storage, and possibly the administration of financial incentives. Implementation could
include financial incentives; mandatory measures – coupled with technical feasibility and cost
and investment recovery mechanisms, if appropriate; or both.
The CCAG recommends further evaluation to identify regulatory, technical, and economic
factors affecting the use of acid gas injection (i.e., acid gas streams containing both H2S and
CO2) in New Mexico. The CCAG suggests focusing on capturing the CO2 currently being
vented at natural gas processing plants and acid gas injection at sour gas processing plants. In
addition, carbon emissions from fluid catalytic cracking units at oil refineries should be
evaluated.
The CO2 reduction goals for this policy option reflect – subject to verification of technical and
economic feasibility and reduction potential – the use of acid gas injection for 100% of all sour
gas processing by 2020, and the capture, storage, and/or reuse of 7% of CO2 emissions from
natural gas processing every year (calculated as 7% of the prior year’s emissions) to 2050.
These CO2 reduction goals are provided for the sole purpose of partially meeting the targets set
by Governor Richardson’s directive and are not necessarily confirmed or validated by any
current study or analysis regarding economic or technical feasibility. It is the intent of the
CCAG to require further study and analysis of CCSR by the NMOCD and other appropriate
agencies, and that from this study and analysis, changes in goals and determinations regarding
the economic and technical feasibility of CCSR may result. This study should consider sour gas
processing facilities (i.e., facilities with sulfur recovery units (SRUs)) separately from natural gas
processing facilities.
ES-12 Methane Reduction in Oil and Gas Operations (BMPs & PROs)
There are a number of ways in which methane emissions in the oil and gas industry can be
reduced. Natural gas consists primarily of methane, so any leaks during production, processing,
and transportation/distribution should be addressed. In addition to reducing potent GHG
emissions, 9 eliminating leaks and venting is economically beneficial because it prevents the
waste of valuable product. The EPA Natural Gas STAR program offers numerous methods of
preventing leaks. These methods, called Best Management Practices (BMPs) and Partnership
Reduction Opportunities (PROs) include opportunities to reduce leaks in venting in the
production, processing, and transportation/distribution of natural gas. 10
The CCAG recommends that – subject to verification of technical and economic feasibility and
reduction potential: (a) New Mexico implement, on a voluntary basis, all BMPs, PROs, and
available technologies starting in 2007 to reduce overall CO2e emissions due to methane
emissions from the oil and gas sector by ~20% by 2020; (b) New Mexico actively promote

participation by oil and gas operators in EPA’s Natural Gas Star program and New Mexico’s San
Juan VISTAS program; and (c) as voluntary measures are implemented, if the State determines
that oil and gas operators are not on track to achieve the above goal, the State should implement
mandatory approaches where appropriate. Mandatory measures would be implemented only
after following formal rule making or statutory change procedures with the appropriate “due
process” requirements.
ES-13 CO2 Reduction from Fuel Combustion in Oil and Gas Operations
There are a number of ways in which CO2 emissions in the oil and gas industry can be reduced,
including (1) installing new efficient compressors, (2) replacing compressor driver engines, (3)
optimizing gas flow to improve compressor efficiency, (4) improving performance of
compressor cylinder ends, (5) capturing compressor waste heat, and (6) utilizing waste heat
recovery boilers. Policies to encourage these practices can include education and information
exchange, financial incentives, and mandates or standards that require certain practices.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico focus attention on reducing GHG emissions from fuel
combustion in the oil and gas industry through education, financial incentives, mandates and/or
standards – coupled with cost and investment recovery mechanisms, if appropriate – to: (1)
improve the efficiency of compressors; (2) boost waste heat recovery for compressors and
boilers including the deployment of CHP systems that could sell excess power back to the grid;
and to a lesser extent, (3) replace gas-driven compressors with electrical compressors when
doing so reduces CO2 emissions (the average carbon intensity of New Mexico electricity would
need to be reduced by approximately 30% to make this option carbon-neutral). 11
The CO2 reduction goals for this policy option reflect – subject to verification of technical and
economic feasibility and reduction potential – a reduction in CO2 emissions from fuel
combustion by 75% by 2020. This CO2 reduction goal is provided for the sole purpose of
partially meeting the targets set by Governor Richardson’s directive and are not necessarily
confirmed or validated by any current study or analysis regarding economic or technical
feasibility. It is the intent of the CCAG to require further study and analysis of the approaches
recommended above by the NMED and other appropriate agencies, and that from this study and
analysis, changes in goals and determinations regarding the economic and technical feasibility of
these approaches may result.
ES-14 GHG Cap and Trade
A cap and trade system is a market mechanism in which GHG emissions are limited or capped at
a specified level, and those participating in the system can trade permits (a permit is an
allowance to emit one ton of CO2). By allowing trading, participants with lower costs of
compliance can over comply and sell their additional reductions to participants for whom
compliance costs are higher. In this fashion, overall costs of compliance are lower than they
would otherwise be. 12 Among the important considerations for New Mexico with respect to a
power sector GHG cap and trade program are the sources and sectors to which it would apply,
the level of the cap, how allocations would be distributed, what offsets would be allowed, over
what region the program would be implemented (e.g., nationally, regionally, etc.), and whether
11
12

See Attachment H-9 of Appendix H, Energy Supply Policy Recommendations.
The State of California’s Climate Action Team recently assembled a good discussion of cap and trade design
issues. It can be referenced at: http://www.climatechange.ca.gov/climate_action_team/reports/2005-1208_CAP+TRADE_REPORT.PDF.

5-14

tribally-operated facilities and rural electrical cooperative facilities would be included.
The CCAG recommends that any cap and trade program applicable to New Mexico sources be
preferentially implemented on a national or regional (i.e., multi-state) basis.
The CCAG further recommends that the State of New Mexico should lead or participate in a
regional collaborative to investigate market-based mechanisms, such as cap and trade and other
state policies, that would limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the West and in the
Nation. This will be valuable for the region and inform and help shape national legislation to
regulate GHG emissions. This investigation should take into account social justice concerns and
potential impacts on communities of color.
This policy option was not quantified because New Mexico cannot unilaterally implement a
national or regional cap and trade program. However economic modeling was conducted to
consider potential GHG reductions and cost ramifications for New Mexico relative to other states
under several regional scenarios. This modeling was conducted for the purpose of understanding
the potential impacts upon New Mexico of a cap and trade program, not to define the details of a
prospective cap and trade regulatory program. Using the Governor’s GHG reduction targets as
the cap, the CCAG considered scenarios reflecting a national power sector GHG cap and trade
program; a regional cap and trade program over the Western Electric Coordinating Council
(WECC) states (subject to minor variations as needed to facilitate analysis); and a program over
a sub-region of the WECC states selected so as to minimize “leakage” (i.e., sales into the region
from unregulated sources outside the region). The CCAG also considered alternative program
scenarios covering reflecting all sectors (i.e., an economy-wide approach) as opposed to the
power sector alone. Details on the modeling results can be found in Appendix H.
ES-15 Generation Performance Standard
A generation performance standard (GPS) requires electricity utilities or load serving entities
(LSEs) to acquire electricity with an average emission rate below a specified mandatory
standard. Utilities must take action to ensure that each covered generating facility meets this
standard.
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico develop a GPS applicable to any long-term financial
commitment for new baseload generation, whether for new plants constructed in the state or for
baseload power imported from outside the state. The CCAG also recommends that New Mexico
undertake efforts to remove any perverse incentives to continue running existing high-emitting
facilities. The GPS level would be equivalent to GHG emissions from a new natural gas
combined cycle plant.
ES-16 Regulatory Reform for Electric Cooperatives
As member-owned entities, rural electric cooperatives are often not bound by the same
regulatory conditions as investor-owned utilities (IOUs). The latter enjoy monopoly status in the
marketplace along with a guaranteed rate of return in exchange for close regulatory oversight to
protect customers from undue market power. Electric cooperatives are not seen as requiring
similar regulatory oversight because their customers (coop members) are also owners and thus
have alternative oversight mechanisms available (e.g., elections of Boards of Directors).
As a result of this key regulatory difference, electric cooperatives are often not subject to the
same regulations as IOUs, including state environmental regulations. (They are subject to
federal environmental regulations.) Accordingly, the CCAG believes that it is worth considering
5-15

limited reform of state regulatory provisions so that electric cooperatives face equivalent GHG
reduction requirements as IOUs.
Unless otherwise indicated, the analysis of all ES policy options addresses generation statewide,
and thus includes electricity generated at tribally owned or operated facilities and at electric
cooperatives. While the CCAG remains cognizant that final implementation of ES policy
options is likely to vary among IOUs, tribal facilities, and cooperatives, this approach allows
policy options to be considered equally across the board. Accordingly, the CCAG recommends
this policy option as a non-quantified enabling policy for the electric cooperative-related GHG
emission reductions and costs that are already quantified in the ES policy options. To include
GHG reductions and costs under specific ES policy options as well as under this generic
enabling policy would double-count the associated GHG reductions and costs.

Chapter 6
Transportation and Land Use
Overview of GHG Emissions
The transportation sector is a major source of GHG emissions in New Mexico – currently
accounting for about 18% of the State’s gross GHG emissions. The transportation technologies
and fuels used are key determinants of those emissions, along with population, economic growth,
and various land use policies that all affect the demand for transportation services. GHG
emissions from the transportation sector totaled about 14 MMtCO2e in 2000.
Figure 6-1 shows historical and projected Transportation and Land Use (TLU) GHG emissions
by fuel and source, and illustrates their rapid growth. TLU emissions are expected to roughly
double from 1990 from 2020. New Mexico studies suggest on-road vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) will continue to grow faster than the population, and rapid growth in freight VMT is also
expected.
Subsequent to the compilation of the inventory and projections, Congress enacted the 2005
Energy Policy Act which contained a provision for a national renewable fuel standard that will
likely increase the use of biofuels in New Mexico. This was classified as a “recent action” and
was accounted for in the TLU TWG analysis.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The principal means to reduce TLU emissions include improving vehicle fuel efficiency,
substituting gasoline and diesel with lower-emission fuels, modal switches to lower-emission
means of travel, and various strategies to decrease the growth in fuel use and VMT.
In New Mexico and in the nation as a whole, vehicle fuel efficiency has improved little since the
late 1980s, yet many studies have documented the potential for substantial increases consistent
with maintaining vehicle size and performance. The use of biofuels with lower GHG emissions
is growing in New Mexico and larger market penetration is possible. New Mexico also has
taken some steps to increase transit options and encouraging Smart Growth.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The CCAG recommends a set of 15 policy options for the Transportation and Land Use sector
that offer the potential for major economic benefits and emissions savings. As summarized in
Figure 6-2, these policy recommendations could lead to emissions reductions from reference
case projections of 6.7 MMtCO2e per year by 2020, cumulative savings of nearly 50 MMtCO2e
from 2007 through 2020, and net cost savings of over $1.6 billion to the New Mexico economy
through the year 2020 on a net present value basis (NPV). 1 The weighted average cost of saved
carbon from the policy options for which quantitative estimates of both costs and savings were
prepared was -$36 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent.

The estimated impacts of the individual policies are shown in Table 6-1 below. The CCAG
policy recommendations described briefly here (and in more detail in Appendix I to this Report)
result not only in significant emissions and costs savings, but offer a host of additional benefits

amortized, incremental equipment costs. All NPV analyses here use a 5% real discount rate.

as well. These benefits include (but are by no means limited to) reduced local air pollution, more
livable, healthy communities, and economic development and job growth from in-state biofuel
production.
In order for the TLU policy options recommended by the CCAG to yield the levels of savings
described here, the options should be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
Notably, the State Clean Car program must clear several hurdles before New Mexico or any
other state can adopt it, including EPA approval of the original California Clean Car Program
(that other states can then opt into) and a court challenge to the underlying notion of regulation
of GHG emissions from vehicles. If for any reason, New Mexico is not able to implement the
Clean Car Program, other options could play a larger role. For example, the policies to be
studied under the Incentives/Disincentives Options Bundle (TLU-5) could improve fuel
efficiency through some combination of “feebates”, vehicle excise taxes that vary with fuel
economy, and consumer labeling. Feebate proposals usually have two parts: 1) a fee on
relatively high emissions/lower fuel economy vehicles; and 2) a rebate or tax credit on low
emissions/higher fuel economy vehicles. A multi-state approach to feebates is recommended
here because of the drawbacks of New Mexico (or any state) acting alone in this area.
Greater alternative fuel use (TLU-6) can be accomplished through a combination of voluntary
and mandatory measures. The Renewable Fuel Standard recommended as part of TLU-6 can
increase the use of ethanol and biodiesel, and the incentives recommended in Chapter 7 (Options
A-3 and A-11) can promote in-state production of these fuels through methods with lower
lifecycle GHG emission. Use of zero emission vehicles running on electricity or hydrogen made
from renewable sources can dramatically reduce GHG emissions.
To be most effective, the group of policies aimed at VMT reductions (TLU-7 through TLU-11)
will require change at every level of government, and as such will be most effective with focused
leadership by the State, including training, outreach, and technical assistance to local
governments.

Transportation and Land Use Sector
Policy Descriptions

The TLU sector includes emissions and mitigation opportunities related to vehicle technologies,
fuel choices, transit options, and demand for transportation services.
TLU-1 State Clean Car Program
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico adopt the State Clean Car Program (also known as
the “Pavley” standards or California GHG Emission Standards) in order to reduce GHG
emissions from new light-duty vehicles. The standards, which must still be approved by US
EPA, would take effect in Model Year 2011 (calendar year 2010). Other Clean Car Program
elements include standards requiring reductions in smog- and soot-forming pollutants, and
promoting introduction of very low-emitting technologies into new vehicles.
New cars and light trucks in all states must comply with Federal emission standards, and,
generally speaking, states have the choice of adopting a stronger set of standards applicable in
California. In 2005, California finalized a set of standards that would require reductions of GHG
emissions of about 30% from new vehicles, phased in from 2009 to 2016, through a variety of
means. Eleven states (11) already have adopted the California Clean Car Program standards:
California, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
TLU-2 Low-Rolling Resistance Tires
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico improve the fuel economy of the light duty vehicle
(LDV) fleet by setting minimum energy efficiency standards for replacement tires and requiring
that greater information about Low-Rolling Resistance (LRR) replacement tires be made
available to consumers at the point of sale.
Manufacturers currently use LRR tires on new vehicles, but they are not easily available to
consumers as replacement tires. When installing original equipment tires, carmakers use low
rolling resistance tires as a way to contribute to meeting the federal automobile fuel economy
(CAFE) standards. When replacing the original tires, consumers often purchase less efficient
tires. Currently, tire manufacturers and retailers are not required to provide information about
the fuel efficiency of replacement tires. An appropriate State agency would initiate a fuel
efficient tire replacement program. The program could include consumer education, product
labeling, and minimum standards elements. These programs would be developed under a rule
development process that would incorporate the best scientific information, including the results
from tests of tires conducted by the tire manufacturers, the California Energy Commission, and
other data reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences.

6-5

TLU-3 Low-GHG Operation of State Fleet Vehicles
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico strengthen it’s commitment to reduce GHG emissions
due to operation of state-owned vehicles by enacting legislation that codifies the provisions of
Executive Order 05-049, and requires that the State increase its use biofuels in the fleet of State
vehicles to match the annual targets set forth in Option TLU-6 (Alternative Fuels Use). This is
an enabling option that would have the State government lead by example, ensuring that its own
fleet of vehicles meets or exceeds the targets set for the State as a whole.
TLU-4 Pay-As-You-Drive Insurance
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico change the state insurance regulations to allow PayAs-You-Drive (PAYD) insurance, and initiate and promote an aggressive pilot of PAYD in 2008.
PAYD insurance changes part of vehicle insurance payments from fixed charges to per-mile
charges. By allowing people to save money by changing their driving decisions, PAYD reduces
VMT and emissions. Assuming this pilot recommended here is successful, market penetration
could increase to 100% by 2020. This could happen either through competitive pressure
(increasing numbers of companies offer it in order to stay competitive) or through a change in
state policy mandating PAYD at some point after it has been shown to work.
TLU-5 Incentive/Disincentive Options Bundle
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico further study and develop policy options that create
incentives for the purchase and operation of vehicles that emit low levels of GHGs
(and disincentives for the purchase and operation of vehicles that emit high levels of GHGs).
The range of policies to be studied and developed include:
•

A multi-state “feebate” program, including the neighboring states of California and Arizona.

•

A change in new vehicle excise taxes that increases taxes for relatively high-emitting
vehicles and reduces taxes for relatively low-emitting vehicles. Overall, excise tax revenue
would remain the same.

•

A consumer labeling program that provides buyers with better information on the GHG
emissions of new vehicles.

•

Incentives for diesel retrofits that would encourage the replacement of high-emitting diesel
truck engines with newer, less polluting engines.
Together, these incentives could change the vehicle fleet technology mix through a combination
of demand- and supply-side changes.
TLU- 6 Alternative Fuels Use
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico expand the availability and use of alternative fuels
and expand the use of hybrid vehicles, low speed vehicles, and zero emission vehicles for
transportation in New Mexico. The mechanisms for achieving this would be combination of a
renewable fuels standard (RFS), financial incentives, outreach, and market-based mechanisms.
The RFS would operate according to the table below:

In the near term, the policy also targets increasing sales of hybrid vehicles and partial ZEVs,
while sales of ZEVs are targeted to meet the longer-term goals. Plug-in electric vehicles
equipped with batteries would also serve as storage capacity for wind and solar power through
grid interconnection (V2G). The CCAG also recommends that New Mexico should build
appropriate production capacity for renewables-generated electricity and hydrogen fuels for
transportation purposes in New Mexico.
TLU-7 Infill, Brownfield Re-development
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico increase its efforts to reuse land that is already
developed but is now vacant, underused, or even mildly polluted, and meet the growing demand
by a larger number of households comprised of singles, working parents and single parents for
housing located close to services, jobs and transit. New Mexico should move beyond current
policies in this area, and:
•

Use fiscal, tax and other financing mechanisms to remove barriers to and otherwise support
recycling of existing buildings and underused land.

•

Adapt planning policies and regulations to give infill and brownfield sites priority for
development over sprawling sites at the edges of communities. Include New Mexico
government and educational units in these adapted policies and regulations, so that state
government buildings, universities, and public schools do not contribute to sprawl.

TLU-8 Transit-Oriented Development
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico expand efforts to supportive of building of compact
development around transit stops and clustering employment centers around transit in ways that
allow meet transportation needs to be met by foot, bicycle, or transit. New Mexico
should promote and expand Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) with strong implementation of
the policies recommended in The Report of the Governor’s Task Force on Our Communities,
Our Future: 3
•
•

Tax Increment Financing (TIF) Districts: The state can expand TIF programs through the
extension of its credit resources.
State Funding Programs: Provide state funds for affordable housing and parks, both of which
help make TODs successful.

•

Support of Local Governments: Amend local government enabling laws and provide
technical assistance to help local governments take maximum advantage of transit
investments.
Location of State Facilities: Locate state facilities (including schools and universities) near
transit facilities.
State Targeting of Infrastructure Investments: Legislatively appropriated capital outlay
funds, the State Public Project Revolving Loan Fund, and other state-funded infrastructure
initiatives should be used for projects that encourage walkable and traditional communities,
and are supportive of transit.

TLU-9 Smart Growth Planning, Modeling, Tools
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico expand its efforts in the areas of Smart Growth
planning, modeling, and tools, and thus allow, support, and encourage location-efficient growth
in communities that are proximate to household needs and amenities (such as jobs, shopping,
school, services, entertainment, etc.) as opposed to growth in areas that are not proximate and
require greater travel distance and have less mode choice. Smart growth allows for mixed land
uses, a range of housing opportunities, and multiple transportation options including
pedestrian/bike access. These policies reduce GHG emissions by giving municipalities the tools
they need to shift development patterns and reduce vehicle trips and total vehicle miles traveled,
while avoiding mandates. Similar to TLU-8, the CCAG recommends that New Mexico should
continue to implement and expand the Smart Growth-supportive policies recommended in The
Report of the Governor’s Task Force on Our Communities, Our Future (see TLU-8 above).
TLU-10 Multi-Modal Transportation Bundle
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico should implement the 2025 Statewide Multimodal
Transportation Plan in ways that reduce GHG emissions. The New Mexico 2025 Statewide
Multimodal Transportation Plan establishes objectives and implementation strategies that aim to
shift the State’s focus from roads to an integrated, multimodal system. New Mexico should put
special emphasis on:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Making GHG-optimal use of federal Congestion Mitigation Air Quality funds;
Expanding transit infrastructure (rail, bus, BRT);
Improving existing transit service and support facilities,
Improving transit promotion and marketing (including tax-free and employer-paid Commuter
Benefits, and Parking Cash Out);
Improving bike and pedestrian infrastructure;
Exploring additional commuter rail using existing rail corridors;
Reviewing all proposed transportation projects for multi-modal flexibility (e.g., add or
reserve room for Bus Rapid Transit) or light rail if feasible);
Conducting research into new transportation technologies and urban planning techniques;
Supporting and promoting policies that improve transportation system performance through
non-transportation actions, such as a 4-day work-week and telecommuting.

TLU-11 Promote LEED for Neighborhood Development
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico recognize the lower emissions and reductions in other
public costs of development meeting “LEED-ND” standards. The LEED (Leadership in Energy

6-8

and Environmental Design) Green Building Rating System® is a voluntary, consensus-based
national standard for developing high-performance, sustainable buildings. The “LEED for
Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND)” rating system will integrate the principles of smart
growth, urbanism, and green building into the first national standard for neighborhood design.
LEED-ND will emphasize smart growth aspects and neighborhood design of development while
incorporating a selection of the most important green building practices. LEED-ND ratings will
include measurements of a development’s compact design, proximity to transit, mixed use,
mixed housing type, and pedestrian- and bicycle- friendliness. 4 New Mexico should:
•
•
•

Support municipalities in quantifying the local benefits of LEED-ND developments, and
lowering development fees appropriately;
Require LEED-ND compliance for developments involving state facilities or funding;
Support the New Mexico building and real estate industries and the non-profit US Green
Building Council in promoting LEED-ND to the public and others.

TLU – 14, Truck Stop Electrification/Anti-Idling
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico develop and implement a statewide ordinance
banning idling by heavy-duty vehicles in most situations. The State should also set up truck stop
electrification stations at key truck stops and truck rest areas along the major highways in New
Mexico.
This policy option involves reducing the amount of time that vehicles idle through the
combination of a statewide anti-idling ordinance and by promoting and expanding the use of
technologies that reduce long-term heavy-duty vehicle idling, with an emphasis on encouraging
the use of innovative truck stop electrification. Anti-idling control measures reduce fuel
consumption and emissions from stationary freight vehicles (potentially wasted energy). With
truck stop electrification, truck drivers can shut off their engines and obtain heating, cooling,
electrical outlets, and communication and entertainment options through a delivery tube provided
in electrified truck stop spaces that connect to the truck through a window adapter. In addition to
truck stop electrification, other available technologies that reduce heavy-duty vehicle idling
include automatic engine shut down/start up system controls; direct fired heaters (for providing
heat only); and auxiliary power units.
TLU-15 Intermodal Freight Initiatives
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico implement policies and programs that result in the
shifting of the transport of freight goods from the roadway system to rail. This should include
evaluating the feasibility of restoring abandoned rail lines to increase the attractiveness of using
rail for local shipments.
Carrying freight by rail rather than truck can significantly reduce emissions and fuel
consumption, while at the same time reducing congestion on major roadways. A number of
small abandoned rail lines already exist in New Mexico. A primary goal of this measure is to
restore those lines, which will allow freight to be carried by rail directly to a number of
warehouses and industrial sites in existing developed areas. This would also provide an
incentive to reduce sprawl from these businesses. Electrifying rail should also be considered.

6-9

New Mexico currently has 2,151 miles of railroad in operation. In many cases, particularly for
long distance freight, freight can be carried by rail more economically and at lower GHG
emission levels than over the existing roadway system. This policy is designed to transfer a
portion of the freight carried over the roadway system to rail wherever possible.
TLU–16 Reduced Speed Limit for Commercial Trucks
Reduced vehicle speeds increase fuel economy, reduce CO2 emissions, and improve safety. The
CCAG recommends that New Mexico consider various options to reduce speed limits in the state
including trucks only (60 mph) and all traffic (60 or 65 mph).

6-10

Chapter 7
Agriculture and Forestry
Overview of GHG Emissions
The agriculture and forestry (AF) sectors are directly responsible for a small amount of New
Mexico’s current GHG emissions. For agriculture, net emissions were 6.0 MMtCO2e in 2000.
Agricultural emissions include CH4 and N2O emissions from enteric fermentation, manure
management, agriculture soils and agriculture residue burning. As shown in Figure 7-1,
emissions from agricultural soils and enteric fermentation in cattle account for the largest
portions of agricultural emissions. The agricultural soils category includes N2O emissions
resulting from activities that increase nitrogen in the soil, including fertilizer (synthetic, organic
and livestock) application and production of nitrogen fixing crops.
The contribution from manure management has grown significantly since 1990 and is projected
to contribute nearly a third of the emissions within the next five to ten years. GHG emissions
from agricultural burning are estimated to contribute a very small amount to the agricultural
sector emissions. Figure 7-1 shows that little growth is expected in emissions from the
agricultural sector beyond 2005.
Forestland emissions refer to the net CO2 flux 1 from forested lands in New Mexico, which
account for about 27% of the state’s land area. As shown in Table 7-1, US Forest Service data
suggest that New Mexico forests and the use of forest products sequestered on average nearly 21
MMtCO2e per year from 1987 to 1997. The data show an accumulation of carbon in each of the
forest carbon pools during this period, except for the harvested wood products and landfilled
forestry waste pools. 2 These rates of sequestration are assumed to remain constant through 2020.
Opportunities for GHG mitigation in the AF sector involve measures that can reduce emissions
within the sector or reduce emissions in other sectors. For example, production of liquid biomass
fuels can offset emissions in the transportation sector, while biomass energy can reduce
emissions in the energy supply or RCI sectors. The primary opportunities for GHG mitigation
are as follows:
•

Production of renewable fuels (in-state production from in-state feedstocks): production
of renewable fuels, such as ethanol from crops, crop residue, forestry residue or
municipal solid waste, can produce significant reductions when they are used to offset
consumption of fossil fuels (gasoline consumption in the transportation sector). This is
particularly true when these fuels are produced using processes and/or feedstocks that
emit much lower GHG emissions than those from conventional sources;

1

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.
This is not to say that the dead carbon pools (e.g., standing dead, forest floor) are sequestering carbon directly from
the atmosphere. These pools accumulate carbon from trees/biomass that transition from a live carbon pool to a dead
carbon pool.
2

7-1

•

Beneficial use of forest biomass: expanded use of biomass energy from residue removed
from forested areas during treatments to reduce fire risk can achieve GHG benefits by
offsetting fossil fuel consumption (either to produce electricity or heat);

Based on USFS data from 1987-1997.

Control and utilization of methane at dairies: methane emissions from manure
management can be reduced through the use of anaerobic digesters or other technology.
The methane captured can then be used to create electricity, steam, or heat to offset fossil
fuel use;
Protection of forest and agricultural land from conversion to developed use: by
protecting these areas from development, the carbon in above-ground biomass and
below-ground soil organic carbon can be maintained and additional emissions of CO2e to
the atmosphere can be avoided;
Support of local farming and food networks: by offsetting a portion of imported food
with locally grown and produced food, GHG reductions can be achieved by reducing the
emissions associated with food transportation;

7-2

•
•

•

Utilize crop residues for heat or electricity production: crop residues that currently have
no significant market (e.g. as animal feed) can be used as an energy source for
commercial, industrial or residential applications;
Support of organic farming: organic farming has been shown to result in significant
increases in soil carbon as compared to conventional cultivation. Additional GHG
reductions are also possible to the extent that organic techniques reduce fossil fuel
consumption due to less intensive use of farm equipment; and
Retention of agricultural soil carbon: programs that incentivize growers to keep lands in
conservation programs, instead of returning them to active cultivation, will retain the soil
carbon in these lands. This issue is especially important given the number of acres due to
expire from the federal Conservation Reserve Program in upcoming years.

Additional opportunities for reducing GHGs include: nutrient management to reduce the amount
of nitrogen applied and subsequent GHG emissions; and application of conservation tillage/notill practices on additional croplands in New Mexico. Conservation tillage/no-till practices, as
practiced in organic farming, increase the levels of organic carbon in the soil, which indirectly
sequesters carbon from the atmosphere.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
In the agricultural sector, production of ethanol and biodiesel were found to offer substantial
GHG reduction potential with an estimated 2020 reduction of 1.25 MMtCO2e (combined benefit
of Options A-3 and A-11). This is the benefit from in-state production using New Mexico grown
feedstocks and/or lower GHG production methods. The benefit is incremental to the benefit
achieved via the renewable fuels standards incorporated in TLU Option 6. The benefits for both
biodiesel and ethanol are based on production methods and feedstocks that have lower GHG
emissions than conventional processes. For ethanol, this means processes that achieve much
better GHG reductions than the production from conventional corn-based ethanol. These
processes could include cellulosic hydrolysis, biomass gasification combined with biofuels
production, or alternative starch-based production (fermentation processes fueled by renewable
fuels). For biodiesel, crop production should be promoted that results in significantly better
vegetable oil yields than soybean oil, which is currently the most prominent feedstock in the US.
Candidates include vegetable oil crops like canola, sunflower, or jatropha that have much higher
yields or emerging technologies like algal oil production that could be particularly well-suited to
portions of the state.
For biofuels, challenges in New Mexico will be to identify and promote appropriate feedstocks
for the production of these fuels. Limited analysis by the CCAG suggests that sufficient
feedstock for cellulosic ethanol is available to meet the increased consumption to result from the
TLU renewable fuels standard (without affecting existing markets for these materials). There is
limited capacity within the state for crop production to support biodiesel production without the
use of cropland that is currently used for other purposes or is part of the Conservation Reserve
Program. Hence, careful study is needed to identify available croplands and appropriate crops for
vegetable oil production. Funding and/or incentives will be needed to support the development of
biofuels production capacity, including research and development (for production processes and
feedstocks) and scale-up of production facilities. In addition to vegetable oil, sufficient planning
is needed to promote in-state production for the other primary feedstock to biodiesel (methanol
7-3

or ethanol). The CCAG is unaware of any commercial-scale production of methanol from
renewable resources; however both Federal and private ventures are underway (ethanol is
currently produced in New Mexico from starch-based feedstocks). Additional research and
development will be needed to assure that these alcohols are produced from renewable in-state
resources to maximize the GHG benefits (e.g., manure energy, biomass gasification, cellulosic
hydrolysis).
As shown in the policy option descriptions in Appendix J, the implementation mechanisms
developed for the agricultural sector should focus on methods that avoid conflict with potential
future market-based GHG reduction programs. These include GHG credits that could be
generated in the agricultural sector through renewable fuels projects, soil carbon projects, and
possibly other project types. New regulations that mandate emission reductions or specific
agricultural practices could limit New Mexico agriculture from taking part in emerging carbon
markets. Implementation mechanisms that are incentive and education based can avoid these
conflicts.
Combining the agricultural and forestry land protection options (F-1 and A-8), 0.33
MMtCO2e/yr in GHG emissions is estimated to be saved in 2020. To achieve these reductions,
the state will need to work closely with local planning agencies, land owners, and nongovernmental organizations to identify lands suitable for acquisition/conservation easements and
funding mechanisms. Another benefit to these options, which was not quantified, is the reduction
in vehicle-miles traveled due to more efficient development patterns.
Adoption of organic farming methods (Option A-9) has been shown to result in significant
benefits by 2020 (0.4 MMtCO2e/yr). Only the reductions achieved through increases in soil
carbon have been quantified. The challenges in New Mexico will be to identify and
communicate opportunities for growers to adopt these methods in order to achieve the levels of
participation envisioned in the policy design (352,000 acres by 2020, which represents 70% of
vegetable and field crop production). A strong educational and outreach program will be needed.
Closely associated with the organic farming option is the conservation tillage/no-till option (A6). This option will also result in increases in soil carbon, thereby sequestering carbon dioxide
(0.13 MMtCO2e sequestered in 2020 or 0.08 MMtCO2e after accounting for the overlap with
Option A-9).
Option A-10 seeks to promote local farming programs and food systems that achieve significant
reductions in food transportation-related GHG emissions. The CCAG estimates that if 25% of
food consumed in New Mexico is supplied by in-state production by 2020, then over 1
MMtCO2e/yr could be avoided. Challenges for the state will be to develop new programs and/or
enhance existing programs to the levels needed to achieve the policy’s goals. Methods to better
characterize the existing food distribution system in New Mexico are needed, as well as methods
to monitor a transition of the system toward more locally produced products.
Option A-7 seeks to retain in an uncultivated state cropland that is about to expire from the
Conservation Reserve Program, thereby preventing the oxidation of soil carbon and subsequent
CO2 emissions. The CCAG recognizes that additional work is needed to identify appropriate
implementation approaches for this option.
Also in the forestry sector, utilization of biomass recovered from forest health & restoration
projects (Options F-2a and b) has a significant potential for GHG benefits (0.6 MMtCO2e/yr by
2020). The estimated benefits focused on those obtained by utilizing biomass energy from forest

7-4

treatment projects (to reduce fire risk). Success will be achieved through close cooperation
between New Mexico, federal agencies (USFS), and private industry to identify biomass
resources and effective end uses for the resource.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The CCAG recommends a set of 12 policy options for the AF sector that offer the potential for
major economic benefits and emissions savings. Figure 7-2 shows the estimated impacts of the
emissions savings on the AF sector emissions. This figure shows the net AF emissions (including
forestry sinks) combined with the GHG emission reductions estimated for the recommended
policy options. Net emissions of -14.7 MMtCO2e in 2005 are reduced to -19.0 MMtCO2e in
2020. The figure shows the effects of the policy options in one data series, since the AF policy
options achieve emission reductions not only from the AF source sectors, but in other source
sectors as well (e.g., transportation sector due to biofuels production; energy supply or RCI from
biomass energy production).
As summarized in Table 7-2, the AF policy recommendations could lead to emissions reductions
from reference case projections of 4.8 MMtCO2e per year by 2020, cumulative savings of over
41 MMtCO2e from 2007 through 2020, and net cost savings of over $195 million through the
year 2020 on a net present value basis (NPV). 3 The weighted average cost of saved carbon from
the policy options for which quantitative estimates of both costs and savings were prepared was
-$5 per metric ton of CO2 equivalent. Although a cost estimate for Option A11 (Biodiesel
Production) was not developed, the CCAG believes that would still be a net savings to the New
Mexico economy in implementing this package of options.

amortized, incremental equipment costs. All NPV analyses here use a 5% real discount rate.

The estimated impacts of the recommended policies are shown in Table 7-2. The CCAG policy
recommendations described briefly here (and in more detail in Appendix J to this Report) result
not only in significant emissions and costs savings, but offer a host of additional benefits as well.
These benefits include (but are by no means limited to): 1) Support of New Mexico agricultural
producers in the production of biofuels crops, development of new markets for agricultural
byproducts, production of crops to support locally consumed foods, and training/outreach
covering energy production and organic farming; 2) Creation of jobs in the biomass energy and
liquid biofuels feedstock/production industries; 3) Healthier forests with lower fire risk through
the development of markets for forestry residue; and 4) Research and development work to be
conducted by New Mexico universities to support many of the policies for this sector.

Agriculture and Forestry Sector
Policy Descriptions

The Agriculture and Forestry Sectors include emissions and mitigation opportunities related to
use of biomass energy, protection and enhancement of forest and agricultural carbon sinks,
control of agricultural methane emissions, production of renewable fuels, and reducing transport
emissions from imported agricultural commodities. As described in the options descriptions in
Appendix J, the CCAG recommends policies in the agriculture featuring implementation
methods that are voluntarily implemented by individual producers.
F-1 Forestland Protection from Developed Uses
Reduce the rate at which existing forestlands and forest cover are cleared and converted to
developed uses or damaged by development that reduces productivity.
The CCAG recommends that policies be developed to decrease the conversion of forest and
woodlands to urban and other developed uses to 30 percent or less of the rates of loss to these
uses during the 1987-1997 period by 2012 and to 50 percent or less by 2020. A 50% reduction
would decrease the conversion rate from 3,900 acres/year to about 1,900 acres/year. By reducing
the rates of conversion, both above- and below-ground carbon can be retained, the sequestration
potential of these lands is retained, and GHG emissions associated with travel are indirectly
reduced via reducing commute distances.
F-2a and b Forest Health & Restoration
Manage sustainable thinning or biomass reduction from residential forestlands (intended to
address fire and forest health issues) so that harvested biomass is directed to wood products and
renewable energy instead of open burning or decay. F-2a is directed at residential lands (the
wildland-urban interface or WUI) and F-2b is directed at non-WUI areas.
Some efforts to reduce biomass in residential forests and woodlands for forest
health/sustainability and wildfire suppression include some emphasis on using the extracted
woody biomass for wood products and/or energy production (e.g. local residential firewood).
However, a large portion of these materials are managed through open burning, or storage or
decay off site. The CCAG recommends placing a greater emphasis on wood products and/or
energy production, through appropriate mechanisms, incentives, etc. More specifically, the
CCAG recommends utilizing 50% or more of the biomass extracted from both Wildland Urban
Interface (WUI) and non-WUI areas for wood products and/or energy production by 2012 and
continuing through 2020.

A-1 Manure Energy Utilization
Reduce methane emissions from livestock manure through the use of manure digesters installed
at dairies. Energy from the manure digesters is used to create heat or power, which offsets fossil
fuel-based energy production and the associated GHG emissions. The goal is to manage dairy
manure using anaerobic digesters or other energy capture technology (e.g. biomass gasification)
covering 15% of the state-wide dairy population by 2012, 35% by 2020, and 50% by 2050. The
policy reduces emissions by offsetting fossil fuel consumption, as well as direct reduction of
methane emissions.
A-2 Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity or Steam Generation
Displace fossil fuel usage through the use of agricultural byproducts (e.g., orchard trimmings,
other crop residue) as a feedstock for electricity or steam production. The CCAG recommends a
goal of using 25% of available biomass by 2012, 50% of available agricultural biomass by 2020,
and 75% by 2050. The GHG savings occur as a result of displacing fossil fuel use in the
production of electricity or steam. The CCAG recognizes that available biomass is limited to
agricultural byproducts that are both technically and economically feasible to recover.
A-3 Ethanol Production
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico adopt programs that align in-state production with the
TLU Option 6 ethanol renewable fuels consumption goals of 10% of New Mexico gasoline
consumption by 2012, 20% of gasoline consumption by 2020, and 50% of gasoline consumption
by 2050. The CCAG recognizes that in-state production goals could be limited by available
cropland and waste feedstocks. Careful planning and monitoring of the ethanol production
industry will be needed. State incentives should be directed at in-state feedstocks and production
methods that achieve much better lifecycle GHG emission reductions than conventional starchbased ethanol production (the benefits of which have already been accounted for under TLU
Option 6).
A-6 Conservation Tillage/No-Till
The amount of carbon stored in the soil can be increased by the adoption of conservation tillage.
Reducing mechanical soil disturbance reduces the oxidation of soil carbon compounds and
allows more stable aggregates to form. In addition to soil carbon benefits, conservation tillage
has numerous co-benefits including reduced wind and water erosion, reduced fuel consumption
and improved wildlife habitat. The CCAG’s goal is to bring an additional 650,000 acres into
conservation tillage/no-till production by 2015 and 1,300,000 acres by 2025. Note that this
option has overlap with Option A-9 on Organic Farming (no-till is a common organic farming
technique). The overlap in the benefits for these options have been addressed in Table 7-2.
A-7 Convert Agricultural Land to Grassland or Forest
Increase carbon sequestration in agricultural land by converting marginal land used for annual
crops to permanent cover (grassland/rangeland or orchard). Also, prevent the loss of soil carbon
in the future associated with cropland currently in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP).
Adopt mechanisms to either keep these cropland acres in the CRP or prevent them from either
returning to conventionally tilled production or to suburban/urban development.
The CCAG did not identify significant opportunities for conversion of marginal agricultural land
in New Mexico; however the protection of CRP acres and their associated soil carbon, is a
7-9

significant issue. Since the conversion of the expiring CRP acres into cultivated acres was not
built into the forecast of emissions, the reductions associated with this option (i.e. those
associated with the protection of soil carbon) were not included in the summary totals for the AF
sector.
A-8 Reduce Permanent Conversion of Agricultural & Rangeland to Developed Uses
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico adopt programs to reduce the rate at which
agricultural lands are converted to developed uses, while protecting private property rights and
responsibilities. These recommendations are aligned with the goals of the analogous option for
forested lands (F1). The policy should be initiated by 2010 and it should achieve a 30%
reduction by 2012; a 50% reduction should be achieved by 2020. By 2020, achieving these goals
would save 8,600 acres of land per year from being converted to developed use. This would
retain the above- and below-ground carbon on these lands, as well as the carbon sequestration
potential of these lands. Transportation emissions would be reduced indirectly through more
efficient development and lower vehicle use.
A-9 Programs to Support Organic Farming
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico adopt programs to achieve a long-range goal of
increasing organic-certified and non-certified-organic acreage to approximately 70% of the
cropland used for vegetable and field crop production in the state by 2050. The organic
production acreage could increase to 352,000 acres by 2020 depending on drought impacts and
the availability of water. The CCAG believes that the goal of this option is achievable if
sufficient market growth for organic products occurs by 2050. The GHG benefits of organic
production are due to its higher levels of soil carbon (indirectly sequestering CO2 from the
atmosphere). It also uses fewer chemical inputs, which reduces the GHG emissions associated
with the production and transport of these products.
A-10 Programs to Support Local Farming/Buy Local
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico adopt programs to increase the amount of locally
produced food consumed in the state. From today’s approximate 3 percent consumption of local
food (much of this is dairy products), by the year 2012, local food systems need to be
constructed to shift to 8% local food consumption, and to 25% by 2020. Reductions in GHG
emissions occur through offsetting imported foods with high embedded GHG (from
transportation) with local foods that have significantly lower embedded GHG.
A-11 Biodiesel Production
The CCAG recommends that New Mexico adopt programs to increase the amount of biodiesel
produced within the state. The goals are to produce enough biodiesel to meet 10% of New
Mexico diesel consumption by 2012, 20% by 2020, and 50% by 2050. This option is paired with
TLU Option 6, which targets methods to increase biodiesel consumption in the state. Optimum
GHG benefits are achieved when the biodiesel consumed in the state is produced in-state from
crops that are much more efficient than conventional crops (i.e. soybean oil). There appears to be
limited in-state capacity for significant vegetable oil production (one of the primary feedstocks
for biodiesel production). Therefore, this option includes incentives for research and
development of cropping systems and emerging technologies (e.g. algal biodiesel), as well as
scale-up of these cropping/production systems to commercial scale.
