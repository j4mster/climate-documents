MAINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2004
OVERVIEW
A 2003 Maine law (PL 237) required the Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) to develop and submit a Climate Action Plan (CAP or Plan) for
Maine. The goals of the CAP are to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
to1990 levels by 2010, 10% below those levels in 2020, and by a sufficient
amount to avert the threat of global warming over the longer term, which could be
as much as 75%. This law was built on a New England Governors and Eastern
Canadian Premiers resolution calling for similar reductions. Several New England states have adopted or are in the process of drafting their own plans. The

conducting emissions inventories for state facilities and programs; obtaining voluntary carbon reduction agreements with private sector businesses and nonprofit organizations; participating in a regional GHG registry; and establishing an
annual statewide GHG emissions inventory.
For the past year and a half, the Department has worked with approximately 100 stakeholders to develop the Plan. In addition to a core group of
30 stakeholders comprising the Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG), four different
Working Groups (Transportation and Land Use; Buildings, Facilities, and Manufacturing; Energy and Solid Waste; and Agriculture and Forestry segments) consisting of approximately 100 individuals, met to identify measures, develop
baselines, analyze pros and cons, and draft recommendations to the Stakeholder
Advisory Group, and ultimately, the Department.

assumptions to be used for baseline and reduction calculations so that the CAP
would be as Maine-specific as possible. The results show that, under a businessasusualscenar

recommended actions would, if taken together and implemented, make significant progress toward the statutory emission reduction targets, and may even
meet them.
There are multiple actions for each of the four sectors. The report presents the actions in a variety of ways: by the amount of greenhouse gases
saved; by cost-effectiveness; and grouped by sector. The Report also indicates
next steps to implement the actions. Some actions require further legislation,
while others can be implemented through executive order, rulemaking, or voluntary activity. Some will need further discussions and development before implementation.
A number of the included actions are initiatives that are already well under

amount of carbon to be saved for that option. For the few that did not achieve
consensus, the Report describes the pros and cons expressed by stakeholders.
The stakeholders paid careful attention to using the best available data for
modeling and calculation. It was necessary, though, to choose certain values for
key variables (such as economic growth), which are sensitive over the relevant
time period (2005 to 2020) to relatively small initial differences in assumptions, or
to subsequent changes. While the Department is confident that the data and assumptions used to calculate the forecast carbon savings and cost information are
as refined as possible at this point, we are also aware that additional information,
or more sophisticated analysis, is likely to change specific numbers. In addition,
the final policy design and implementation strategy for each option may require
changes to the projected carbon savings and cost estimates. Since we view the
CAP as a continuing and living document, we will expect to modify the specifics
as better information becomes available. The Legislature clearly had this in mind

progress toward meeting the reduction goals specified and amend the action
plan as necessary by January 1, 2006, and every two years thereafter. Beginning in 2008, the DEP may recommend that the reduction goals be increased or
decreased.
The Plan contemplates public education and outreach efforts. There is an
Education and Public Awareness Working Group to assist the Department to offer public sessions at which this Climate Action Plan can be presented to wider
audiences. The Department, along with other agencies of this administration, will
work with the legislature to refine and implement the Plan, a leadership role that
Maine frequently takes.

HIGHLIGHTS
Forestry Benefits. One of the more interesting and groundbreaking issues
involves the forestry sector, which presents significant opportunities for carbon
savings through sequestration. Extensive analysis of data from Federal and
State sources, combined with careful exploration of assumptions about, for example, the role of forest soils in the carbon cycle, brought the Working Group to
conclude that certain forms of active management already well-understood by
the forest industry were capable of producing real carbon savings at very low or
negligible cost. The options, voluntary in nature, would improve silviculture to
produce more and higher-quality wood as an important co-benefit. It will be important to develop incentives needed to increase markets of this wood. The
modeling of the carbon savings and costs suggest the likelihood that, taken together, these options would be close to cost-neutral, and could produce new

first Climate Action Plan in the United States to fully consider the forest carbon
cycle and active management options as a significant part of the overall GHG
mitigation effort, further research and modeling will be necessary as part of implementation planning.
Efficiency Rewards. By establishing a baseline based on an earlier period, the Plan allows for higher production through economic efficiency. Industry
is rewarded for both GHG reductions and more efficient production methods.
Trade Possibilities. The Plan gives Maine a competitive advantage by establishing a GHG baseline and registry. As more states develop GHG plans,
along with the many countries with existing or contemplated plans, Maine may be

Co-benefits. Most of the recommended actions are expected to produce
significant co-benefits in addition to saving carbon. Of particular significance are
those will have a positive impact on human health, will save consumers money
through energy conservation and efficiency, will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas, will create jobs, and/or can be expected to promote economic
growth and development. Many of these occur in the realm of air quality affect-

ing human health, since lessening the emission of carbon dioxide from combustion of fossil fuels for electricity or transportation will also lead to reductions in
other air pollutants. These include smog-producing sulfur and nitrogen oxide,
and those fine particulates implicated in asthma and other respiratory diseases.
Other co-benefits are expected to arise from the development of new technologies, particularly in the forestry sector, which in turn will produce additional economic benefits.
Energy Efficiency. Many of the electricity demand management options,
such as energy efficiency measures, will save Maine people and businesses signi

the options would work hand-in-hand with existing State policy goals such as forest and farmland protection.

Maine Department of Environmental Protection convened a group of over thirty stakeholders representing business, industry, environmental groups, and other government
agencies in the autumn of 2003. The purpose was to develop a Climate Action Plan

elopment process builds on the 2001 agreement
among the governors of New England states, and premiers of Eastern Canadian provinces to reduce greenhouse gases in the region. The goals are to reduce emissions to
1990 levels by 2010, 10% below those levels in 2020, and by as much as 75% over the
longer term.2 Under the terms of the legislation, the Department must submit a Plan

During the course of the stakeholder process, the core group (known as the
Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG) met on five occasions to set overall direction, review
recommendations, and advise the Commissioner. SAG members served with other
stakeholders on five different Working Groups (Transportation and Land Use; Buildings,
Facilities, and Manufacturing; Energy and Solid Waste; Agriculture and Forestry; Education and Public Outreach) that each met on four occasions. The Working Groups (WG)
were charged with discussing multiple GHG reduction initiatives, programs, and policy
options in consultation with technical advisors representing a number of different disciplines. They were also charged with making recommendations to the SAG and DEP.
Their work forms the central core of this Plan.3

Recommendations
Based on the work of stakeholders in both the Working Groups and SAG processes, the Department is recommending the following fifty-four actions as necessary to
fill the gap between the baseline and the targets.4 Items in the table are ranked based
on expected GHG emission savings in the year 2020. The number in the first column,

methane to be presented in terms equivalent to CO2. The 2020 savings number is then
applied to the costs (or savings) that the option entails, measured in dollars per unit of
saved CO2 equivalent. In this column, numbers less than –“

- indicate measures that,
if implemented, would save more than they cost over time. Finally, the Working Group
identification number is given to allow easy reference to the working group reports found
in the Appendices. These present information about assumptions and calculations, as
well as fuller descriptions than are found in the Detailed Option Descriptions on pp. 37 to

Several of the options listed above are essentially alternative paths toward the same goal. Each
is listed separately here for purposes of comparison; however, the carbon savings in 2020 have
been adjusted when compiled to produce Figure 1 to avoid double counting. For example, as described in the option summaries, Options 5 (System Benefit Charge) and 11 (Renewable Portfolio
Standard) each seek to support the development of renewables. Similarly, the desired outcomes
of Options 1 and 7 (Offset Requirements; Emission Standards) would be partially met if Option 3
(Regional Cap and Trade) were implemented.

sion to include these options was based primarily on the
assessment of saved carbon, and accompanying costs. The recommended actions
would, if all taken together and implemented, make significant progress toward the statutory 2010 emission reduction targets and would meet them by 2020. However, each one
of them will require a separate plan of implementation, ranging from legislative action,
rule-making or executive order, to encouraging voluntary activity on the part of Maine
people, organizations, and businesses. Some options are presented in a manner that
clearly identifies a specific approach to implementation, such as the adoption of a certain
standard for construction materials.6 Others will require additional study and planning to
arrive at a robust, cost-effective, and publicly acceptable means to put in place the action(s) necessary to reduce emissions.
The stakeholder process of reviewing and recommending these options (and removing others from an original list) was carried out in a way that identified whether an
action received consensus approval or not. At the June 30, 2004 meeting, Commissioner Gallagher concluded that all the options presented here, even when taken together, might not reach the statutory target. The Commissioner then determined that all
should be preserved and presented here regardless of whether they achieved consensus.7 When there was a lack of consensus at the Working Group or Stakeholder Advisory Group level, the detailed Option Descriptions on pp. 37 to 92 indicate that and
delineate the reasons put forward by those who could and could not support the option.
The complete Working Group reports in Appendix 5 identify more specifically those organizations unable to support a given recommendation.

When the 54 recommended options are summed, and compared to the forecast baseline
and targets in Figure 1, the results are as follows:

Several additional forestry options, as well as the overall methodology for estimating GHG savings from the forestry sector resulting in additional GHG savings to help Maine meet the targets,
were finalized subsequent to that Stakeholder meeting.

As can be seen above, carbon savings sufficient to meet the statutory goals can
be attained if all these options are implemented. The savings exceed the goal by approximately 5% in the first calculation; and by approximately 12.5% if black carbon and
its corresponding mitigation options are included. Moreover, the continuing trend downward approaching 2020 indicates that continuation of these options would produce additional reductions in subsequent years.9 However, several cautionary notes are in order:

s’and DEP paid careful attention to using the best available data
for modeling and calculation, but the data are subject to change. For instance, it
was necessary to choose certain values for key variables such as economic
growth which are sensitive over time (2005 to 2020, for example) to relatively
small initial differences in assumptions, or to subsequent changes.

for speed of implementation: that is, the option would be put in place and begin to

its impact. Since a number of the most important options are already expected to

are realized by 2010 and 2020.

agreed on the numerical target for saved carbon for an option, without agreement
as to appropriate implementation.10 Forms of implementation different from those
modeled are likely to produce different results.



The CAP is a living document. The implementation plans for some options will
need to identify appropriate measures, and how to gather the data needed for
measurement. Since the statute specifies that the DEP shall report to the Legislature bi-annually on progress beginning in 2006,11 the Department can identify
and modify, if needed, measurement and savings data.
With these considerations in mind, particularly given the possibility that the op-

tions, either individually or in combination with others, may not save as much carbon as
projected, the Department is forwarding this Plan in the expectation that all the recommended mitigation options, as well as others for which the analysis is not yet complete,
will be needed over time to meet the statutory targets. As will be noted, several of the
most significant recommendations depend on regional agreement and action, while others could be negatively affected by actions on the federal level or decisions made in
other states.12 As a consequence, we believe that adopting and implementing a combination of actions that exceeds the minimum statutory requirements is both prudent and
desirable.

However, comparison with similar plans

generated in other states, and discussion with the consultants, identified that these particular sectors do not lend themselves to discrete analysis for purposes of calculating
carbon savings. Instead, the Stakeholder Advisory Group re-aligned the sectors into Energy and Solid Waste; Transportation and Land Use; Buildings, Facilities, and Manufacturing; and Agriculture and Forestry, with Working Groups for each. The resulting
recommended Options do, however, identify which of the NEG/ECP sectors will be affected by implementation.

Based on the current underlying assumptions, including those relating to economic growth and energy prices, it appears reasonable to estimate is that we can accomplish the 2020 goals at a net negative cost. That is, if all the recommended options
10

MAINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2004

were implemented, the aggregate overall cost per unit of saved carbon would be less
than zero. It should be noted that these data, including cost estimates, are inherently
uncertain, and depend on many variables such as population and economic growth projections, discount rates, etc. The data represent the best possible estimate of these uncertainties at the time the inventory is completed. The inventory will be reviewed, and
modified when necessary, on a regular basis, so that the carbon and cost numbers are
part of a living document. Any changes to these assumptions that emerge in the future
will have the effect of altering either the projected carbon savings, or the cost characteristics of saved carbon, or both. The complete presentation and discussion of the assumptions which produced cost/savings numbers is found in the final reports of the
Working Groups in Appendix 5.

Overview: Options by Working Group Sector
Energy and Solid Waste Options
These options focus on actions to be taken in the areas of electrical energy supply (generation) and solid waste management. The workgroup felt that whenever possible Maine specific data would be preferred. These were essential in two areas: 1)
forecasting future electrical supply and demand; and 2) moving towards a consumptionbased accounting system. The Stakeholder Advisory Group determined that the median
economic forecast provided by Professor Charles Colgan should be used, although
some stakeholders were concerned that the projected economic growth rates were too
high.15

Although the workgroup favored a consumption-based approach it became clear that
this could not easily be modeled. Two major problems are that 1) without a regional approach the possibility of leakage or double counting exists; and 2) that the current methods of collecting consumption data needed to be updated to serve this need. As
discussed in Appendix 2.3, the CAP relies on a modified version of the production
method, one using instate production figures, adjusted to reflect import and export trends
during the period of the modeling. Over the longer term, the Workgroup and SAG bel

11

MAINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2004

Buildings, Facilities, and Manufacturing Options
These options focus on actions to be taken in the commercial, residential and
industrial building management and operation area; and in manufacturing processes.
The workgroup concentrated on developing an inventory and baseline for residential,
commercial, and industrial buildings and facilities that fairly represented the sectors.
Workgroup members supplied facility numbers and other sources of data that replaced
the initial baseline results with Maine-specific data to the greatest possible extent. The
resulting options achieved a very high degree of consensus. The workgroup identified
several areas of concern or modification as the CAP moves forward:
 Allowing facilities to use carbon intensity targets, which would allow them to increase

production as long as the pollution per unit of production was reduced from current
levels. The difficulty with this approach in the context of this Plan is that the legislative goal is based on absolute reduction targets. Since measured levels of GHGs
could increase using this approach, the legislative dictate would potentially need to
be changed.
 The discount rate for payback on investment was left unresolved. The workgroup

thought that the discount rate should be different for each sector. While in the industrial sector a discount rate of less than one year is often expected, a 5 to 7 year payback is probably acceptable in the residential sector.
 Mechanisms to implement some of the options in this area are not specifified, or

would depend on funds for initial capital investment which are not presently identified. The Working Group recommends that the entities responsible for implementing
these options take into account the pros and cons of each of the following mechanisms, including the effectiveness and political viability of each:
1. Education;
2. Recognition Programs;
3. Financial Incentives;
4. Mandatory Programs.

12

MAINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2004

Transportation and Land Use Options
The interactive relationship between land use (siting of residential and commercial areas; managing growth, etc.) and transportation (vehicle use) suggested that these
options be analyzed by the same Working Group. This sector represents the largest
source of GHG pollution in Maine. The recommended options address actions to be
taken by individual consumers, such as a Zero Emission Vehicle mandate and Feebates
(Options 32 and 46) on the one hand; and land use strategies to reduce VMT growth on
the other. As was true in the other workgroups, Maine-specific data were provided by

Workgroup members were concerned that any transportation option take market
fairness into consideration. This fairness could be reached by making sure a regional
approach was used to implement options, like Tailpipe Standards (Option 2) or Feebates. A regional approach would address issues such as boundary issues with close
proximity states and special products for a relatively small market.

subject will affect the diesel transportation segment. The group was concerned about
making recommendations in this area without considering all black carbon-producing
combustion sources and thus requested the Departments of Environmental Protection
and Transportation to study the matter further.

Agriculture and Forestry Options
Because they were thought to represent management of natural resource areas,
particularly as directed toward increasing carbon sequestration,16 representatives of
these interests shared the same Working Group. As time went on, however, it became
clear that significantly different options applied to each. As a result, the Options are divided between five Agricultural options, and seven Forestry options.
As seen in Table 1, the forest sector presents significant opportunities for carbon
savings through sequestration. Early in its analysis, the Agriculture and Forestry Worki

sources, combined with careful exploration of assumptions about, for example, the role
of forest soils in the carbon cycle, brought the WG to the conclusion that certain forms of

Information about the carbon savings and costs for the Forestry options differs
from all the others. The 2010 / 2020 template for setting carbon emission reductions,

management option to increase the sequestration of carbon that is put in place in 2005
might actually increase GHG emissions for the first ten years, but result in substantial
carbon savings over the lifetime of the forest. After considering and comparing the calculations for carbon savings and costs over a 15-year span (2005-2020), and then a 95year span (through 2100), the Working Group adopted a 58-year time horizon as best
representing the life-span of a typical managed forest. In order to report data comparable with that for the non-f

al carbon savings over 58 years were averaged to an equal annual
number for purposes of modeling. The Working Group and its technical advisors recognize that this is an artificial construct, but were agreed that it best represents the contribution of the forest sector to the long-term reduction of GHG emissions in Maine.17

large industrial and other actively managed woodlands. The options would improve silviculture to produce more and higher-quality wood as an important co-benefit. As can
be seen, implementation of the options would depend primarily on voluntary actions by
landowners, all of which would depend on a variety of incentives needed to increase
markets. The modeling of the carbon savings and costs suggest the likelihood that,
taken together, these options would be close to cost-neutral, and could produce new

For a fuller discussion of the process by which this standard was adopted, and its implications for the calculation of carbon savings and costs, see the Working Group report in Appendix 5.4.

In 2004, the Maine Forest Service received a Federal grant to explore management options more fully, in
order to identify which measures hold the greatest promise. An initial report is expected early in 2005.

Overview: Co-Benefits
Most of the recommended actions are expected to produce significant cobenefits in addition to saving carbon. Of particular significance are those will have a
positive impact on human health, are likely to reward efficiency, and/or can be expected
to promote economic growth and development. Many of these occur in the realm of air
quality affecting human health, since lessening the emission of CO2 from combustion of
fossil fuels for electricity or transportation will also lead to reductions in other air pollutants. These include smog-producing sulfur and nitrogen oxide, and those fine particulates implicated in asthma and other respiratory diseases. Other co-benefits are
expected to arise from the development of new technologies, particularly in the forestry
sector, which in turn will produce additional economic benefits. Many of the electricity
demand management options, such as energy efficiency measures, will save Maine

Finally, a number of the options would work hand-in-hand with existing State policy goals
such as forest and farmland protection. The Options are presented here in several categories of co-benefits:

Information about, and discussion of, co-benefits is presented qualitatively, since
only some of them can be quantified. This is unfortunate, because in many cases the
real cost savings to the economy are significant. Using one of the examples above, for
instance, public health organizations point to significant savings in avoided health care
costs and lost work time consequent on lessening the number of chronic health problems associated with air pollutants.

NEXT STEPS
In presenting this Climate Action Plan, the Department is aware that even if all
the options are approved in principle by the Legislature and stakeholders, implementation will not be immediate or uniform. As previously noted, each of the options will have
its own associated implementation steps. The different anticipated implementation approaches are summarized in Table 5.

The implementation process overall will require several additional considerations.
First, while the Department is confident that the data and assumptions used to calculate
the forecast carbon savings and cost information are as refined as possible at this point,
we are also aware that additional information, or more sophisticated analysis, is likely to
change specific numbers. In addition, the final policy design and implementation strategy for each option may require changes to the projected carbon savings and cost estimates. Since we view the CAP as a continuing and living document, we will expect to
modify the specifics as better information becomes available. The Legislature clearly

y1,2006, and every two years thereafter.22 Beginning
in 2008, the DEP may recommend that the reduction goals be increased or decreased.
In order to meet this standard, some of the recommended options will need further determination of performance measures, and accompanying data gathering and analysis
activities, as part of implementation.
Since many of the recommended options would have, when implemented, direct
effects on individual citizens, institutions, organizations, and businesses in Maine, further
efforts will be needed in the area of public education and outreach. Many of these options already identify key groups to engage in implementation, but the Plan as a whole
must also be presented to the people of Maine. The Commissioner has asked the Education and Public Awareness Working Group to continue its work, in particular by planning and assisting the Department to offer one or more public sessions at which this
Climate Action Plan can be presented to wider audiences. Maine citizens must be invited to j

the broader context of regional, national, and international activity. A number of the options that are most significant (in terms of potential for carbon reduction) either depend
upon, or have effects that would be enhanced by, the actions of other jurisdictions.23

Chief among these are Options 2 (Tailpipe GHG Standards); 3 (Regional Cap and Trade); 4

23

19

MAINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2004

development of, and demand for, renewable electricity supplies, will be affected by similar actions taking place in other New England states. Finally, the NEG/ECP jurisdictions
have yet to agree on important items related to the long-term counting and crediting of
emission reductions, particularly in the electricity sector, where agreed common assumptions would allow more accurate calculation of carbon savings and costs. It will be
important for Maine to continue to lead these efforts.
The Report, as required by law, will be delivered to the Natural Resources committee of the Maine Legislature. The Department will bring to the attention of the legislature those proposed actions that require further legislative activity. While many of these
would come under the jurisdiction of the Natural Resources committee, there are others
that would likely be directed to other committees such as Utilities and Energy, or Transportation. The Department expects to ask the leadership of the 122nd Legislature, and
the House and Senate chairs of the relevant committees, to appoint a group of legislators representing the committees. This group could be charged with reviewing the CAP
and determining which of the recommended actions may require additional legislative
action. It could then coordinate the process of moving the measures through the legislative process. It would also be asked to oversee implementation of aspects of the CAP,
including the establishment of priorities for action.
The Plan will also be delivered to the Office of the Governor. Some of the recommended actions, such as state purchases of renewable energy, are currently under
way in the executive branch. The Department, or other appropriate agency, will continue
to implement these measures. The Department will begin implementation of other actions for which it currently has authority. The Department will work with other executive
branch agencies to implement recommended actions in their purview.
There are additional issues that may require additional work by the Department
over the course of the next year. For example, the carbon status of biomass for purposes of the recommended actions is an issue that needs further clarification and definition before moving forward. The Department expects that the legislative group chosen
to oversee the implementation of the CAP will provide input on how the legislature would
like to see issues of this sort dealt with.

While natural phenomena such as volcanic explosions can add significantly to
the GHG in the atmosphere, the burning of fossil fuels, the clearing of forests, and other
human interventions appear to be destabilizing the global climatic system which has
been gradually changing (in this case, warming) since the end of the last Ice Age, about
12,000 years ago. This has been exacerbated in recent times, so that the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in its Third Assessment Report t

To cite one of the

most commonly used measures of change, atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide
(CO2) has increased from a pre-industrial level of 280 parts per million (ppm) to the current level of 360 ppm, 31 per cent higher than the pre-industrial levels. Unless steps are
taken to lessen further releases of GHGs, these levels are projected to increase to 450
ppm by 2025, and 550 ppm by 2050. The current level of CO2 in the atmosphere has
not been exceeded in the past 420,000 years, and probably not in the past 20 million
years.27
Since CO2 molecules persist in the atmosphere for more than a century, their effect on climate cannot be quickly halted or reversed. However, long-term climatic
changes are difficult to predict with certainty because of the complexity of the climate

the effects of climate change could include increased global average surface temperature of 2.5 to 10.4° F. This and other changes will not be evenly distributed over time or
geography, and may include rapid and unexpected changes in temperature and water
cycles.28
If no action is taken, the IPCC identifies as likely consequences some or all of the
following:
 Increase in the incidence and severity of extreme weather events such as
storms, droughts, floods, and heat waves;
 Rise in global sea level, including stresses on estuaries, bays, and wetlands;
 Changes in precipitation rates impacting water supplies and food production;
 Shifts in and/or expansion of certain disease and pest vectors; and
 Further stress on already vulnerable species and eco-systems.

ural resources in the areas of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, as well as for human infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions.29
The anticipated human health effects of global climate change are profound, if
less easy to quantify. Both the IPCC and World Health Organization have agreed that
significant effects are likely. These include temperature-related illnesses and death;
health effects related to extreme weather events; air pollution-related health problems;
water- and food-borne diseases; and insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue,
Lyme disease, and encephalitis.
In Maine, there is not yet evidence of significant warming, for reasons that are
thus far unclear. However, there are already measurable changes in seasonal variation,
and in patterns of precipitation, with particular impacts on groundwater, which can reasonably be associated with climate change.
Even in the face of uncertainties regarding the precise consequences to be expected from increasing levels of atmospheric CO2, there has been increasing world-wide
interest in taking steps to reverse the trend.30 In 1992, the United States and other parties (187 countries to date) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change agreed to adopt the long-term goal of stabilizing GHG concentrations at a level

While the United States has thus far not ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which sets targets for the total quantity of GHGs that industrialized countries would be allowed to emit,
a number of states and local jurisdictions have developed climate action plans centered
on steps to be taken to lessen GHG emissions.31
In July 2000, the Conference of New England Governors and Eastern Canadian
Premiers (NEG/ECP) adopted Resolution 25-9 on global warming and its impacts on the
environment. The Conference recognized that global warming, given its harmful consequences to the environment and the economy, is a joint concern for which a regional ap28

The NEG/ECP Plan commits each member jurisdiction to participate in the achievement
of regional goals which mirror those proposed in the UN Framework Convention and

Such an inventory is necessary to establish baselines from which emissions

reductions such as those called for in the subsequent legislation can be calculated. The
Department has subsequently revised its Emission Statement Regulation (DEP Chapter
137) to include the reporting of GHGs for inclusion in the Emissions Inventory, making
Maine the first jurisdiction in the region to mandate the reporting of GHG emissions.
In June 1998, the State Planning Office (SPO) released a draft report, Responding to
Global Climate Change and Achieving Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions in Maine:

measure the GHG emissions from the state transportation sector.

To date, other state agencies have also been active in measures to reduce energy use, and thus, greenhouse gas emissions. The Department of Transportation has
converted traffic lights at intersections in its span of control from conventional to LED
(light emitting diode) lamps, and has made funds available to municipalities to promote
similar conversion.
The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has primary responsibility for managing
state-led energy efficiency programs. The PUC's Energy Programs Division administers
the State Energy Program, a United States Department of Energy funded effort whose
goal is to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. The PUC's Energy Programs Division also administers the Efficiency Maine program whose focus is to increase electrical energy efficiency throughout the Maine economy. Efficiency Maine was
created to implement the legislature's Conservation Act and is funded through electric
utility rates.
In the area of renewable electrical generation, Maine has been a significant national leader. Since 2000, Maine electricity producers have been required to meet a
standard of 30% of all power coming from renewable sources. This is the highest such

The present document is intended to meet that requirement.
The Department believes that the Climate Action Plan for Maine (proposed
herein) builds on the foundation of the earlier SPO document and offers a comprehensive group of cost-effective actions needed to meet the statutory requirements. The 54
options create a solid policy basis on which to proceed toward the long-term reduction
targets. This Plan also identifies significant co-benefits to mandated GHG emission reductions, including many that would promote innovation and economic development for

The Department also believes that the title of the enabling legislation is particularly instructive. Since actual GHG emissions from Maine sources constitute a very
small portion even of US national emissions, so that Maine ranks 43rd among the
states,38 actions taken within the state will have little direct impact on the global problem
of GHG build-up in the atmosphere and resultant climate change. Instead, as suggested

The group met for the first time on July 24, 2003.40
During the same period, the Department explored various options for assuring
the technical and process expertise necessary to staff CAP development. After review
of the parallel GHG/Climate plan processes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, and consultation with leaders in other states, the DEP entered into contracts (though the Muskie
School of Public Service at the University of Southern Maine) with Raab Associates,
Ltd., Boston, MA, for overall process coordination and facilitation; and with the Center for
Clean Air Policy, Washington, D.C., and with Thomas D. Peterson, LLC, for technical
consultation.41 Raab Associates also developed a Web site dedicated to Mai

etc. were made available to stakeholders and the public.42 All written materials developed during the process, or submitted by stakeholders for consideration, will be maintained on this site for the immediate future, since limitations of space precluded them
from being included in the written Appendix to this report.

named the Stakeholder Advisory Group (SAG), would assist the DEP to set general direction and review recommendations for mitigation options. Members of the SAG, supplemented by additional stakeholder representatives, also served on Working Groups
charged with closer investigation of options in each of four general areas:
1. Transportation and Land Use;
2. Buildings, Facilities, and Manufacturing;
3. Energy and Solid Waste; and

Dean Karl Braithwaite of the Muskie School. Members of the group were to be available
on an as-needed basis to provide second-party review of economic, scientific, technical

recommendations. The SAG first reviewed the goals, missions and objectives of the
process, and held an initial discussion of the forecast emissions baseline for Maine GHG
emissions. They also agreed on the ground rules governing their activities. At a second

meeting, in December, the SAG reviewed an extensive list of possible options gathered
from a wide range of sources, and identified those it thought worthy of further consideration to be forwarded to the Working Groups. The SAG met on three further occasions,
concluding its work on September 29, 2004 with a final review of the draft proposed
CAP.
The four primary Working Groups each met for three or four day-long meetings
(supplemented with conference calls and sub-committee work) to identify options in specific areas, working with consultants to assure that basic assumptions governing each
option were agreed in advance. Some of the options in each group were based on existing activities or programs in Maine, while others were completely new. For each option,
the Working Groups were presented with information describing the action to be taken,

savings, and potential co-benefits where available. Each option was then modeled for
its behavior over time. The working Groups presented the options to the SAG in the
form of reports identifying the extent of agreement / consensus in recommending a given
option, together with additional thoughts and concerns regarding each. It should be
noted that there was no requirement that an option reach consensus or majority approval in order to be passed on to the SAG, although in most cases, options not receiving at least majority approval were dropped from the list, or deferred for further study. In
a number of cases, sub-committees and individuals within the Working Groups prepared
white papers on specific topics; several of these are included in the Appendices.

aloccasions to identify a strategy for making the CAP accessible to the legislature and the general public. They also evaluated the individual mitigation options in terms of their impact on affected groups, likely co-benefits, and public
components. Their analysis is included in the description of each mitigation option. The
Department expects that this group may be re-convened during 2004-2005 to assist in
public outreach efforts associated with the implementation of this Plan.

PART 2: DETAILED OPTION DESCRIPTIONS
Introduction
Based on consideration of a list of potential GHG mitigation options originally
presented to the Stakeholder Advisory Group in December, 2003, each of the four Working Groups (Transportation and Land Use; Buildings, Facilities, and Manufacturing; Energy and Solid Waste; Agriculture and Forestry) worked with the technical consultants to
identify and refine those options which appeared to have the greatest potential for costeffective carbon savings. Each of those recommended by DEP for possible adoption, or
suggested for additional study and modeling, is summarized in the following pages.
More extensive information about the assumptions underlying the calculations of cost,
carbon benefit, etc., may be found in the Appendix volume, where the complete final reports of the Working Groups are printed.
The GHG mitigation options are designed to change technologies and practices
in ways that reduce the emission of GHGs to the atmosphere. Each option sets out a
key strategy that would need to be refined and specified further at the level of state implementation. Some policy approaches are broad, affecting many processes and technologies, while others are more specific.
The 54 (options included in Group I below are arranged in the same order as

highest to lowest in terms of estimated 2020 carbon savings. While the Working Group
and Stakeholder Advisory Group processes identified some options as having reached
consensus (defined as unanimous support), and others for which consensus was not
reached, Commissioner Gallagher determined at the June 30, 2003, meeting that since
all the modeled options taken together were not at that time projected to reach the legisl

sCAP would include these without distinction.46
Even if all options taken together met the targets, it would be imprudent not to
pursue most or all of them. Some benefits come after 2020 (especially for some of the
Forestry options); the assumptions behind the expected reductions are likely to change

Each option summary includes identification of consensus or its absence. Where a summary is
silent, consensus is assumed. The complete Working Group reports in Appendix 5 identify more
specifically the organizations that did not agree with a particular recommendation, as required by
the agreed Groundrules.

34

MAINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 2004

tantly, there will likely be many unexpected delays causing the options to be implemented later than planned.
The characterization of each option contains a number of key measures or indicators:
 The reduction in emission of carbon to the atmosphere in 2020. This in-

dicates the total impact in 2020 as a result of implementing all the measures
from 2005 (or later) and on through 2020, expressed in thousands of metric
tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
 The cost per unit of saved carbon is the net cost of the option (cost of

saved carbon minus avoided costs) divided by the carbon reductions for the
option. The costs and carbon reductions are computed through a discounted
c
ashf
l
owand“
car
bonf
l
ow”anal
y
si
sov
ert
he15-year time period.47 There
are many options (largely energy efficiency and demand reduction in buildings, facilities, and transportation) that result in net savings (i.e., avoided
costs from saved energy or other resources are greater than the cost of implementing the measure). Thus, this cost can be a negative number, indicating a very promising option that reduces carbon emissions and saves money.
 Performance measures are quantitative or qualitative metrics that can be

used to monitor the effectiveness of the option once implemented.
 Implementation method(s) vary widely among options. If implementing an

option would require legislative or regulatory action, or State Executive order,
it is indicated here.
 Co-benefits are defined as the results from implementing an option which

produce a benefit in addition to reducing carbon emissions. For instance,
many of the recommended actions would also decrease emission of other air
pollutants with significant human health effects such as fine particulate matter
and air toxics. Other co-benefits and side effects, such as the potential for
economic development, are more difficult to quantify and are here described
qualitatively.
For many of the options, additional notes below the summary provide general
background and further details about the option, including information on specific comments made by Stakeholders in working group or SAG meetings.

As explained in further detail in the Forestry Working Group report (Appendix x), the carbon
savings and costs for the forestry options have been calculated using a 58-year time horizon (approximately through 2063) instead of the 15-year time period utilized for all other options. The
Working Group agreed on this approach as better representing the real life cycle of the forest.

no greater than 10% below those emitted in 1990.48 As noted above, not all of these are
proposed on the basis of consensus by the Stakeholders to the CAP. They have in
common that the technical consultants and Stakeholders were generally agreed on the
assumptions underlying the calculation of carbon to be saved if the option were to be

11,332,617 metric tons of projected carbon savings, slightly exceeding the reductions
needed to meet the statutory target.

require a greater depth of understanding of both technical and policy implications than
could be achieved in time for complete stakeholder review. Others (5, 11) are noted as
having been approved in principle by stakeholders, but which there were differences of
opinion about the details of implementation. These will require additional research,
technical modeling and policy consideration. The Department will make every effort,
within resource constraints, to complete the evaluation of these options in consultation
with stakeholders.
Some options (2, 3, 6, 46, 49) would either require a regional or multijurisdictional approach to be implemented, or at least would be most effective if implemented in a broader context.

those potential emissions mitigation actions which seemed particularly promising to the
stakeholders and the DEP, but for which at the moment the data, particularly the calculation of amounts of saved carbon and/or cost of saved carbon, are incomplete. Others in
this group identify actions to educate and inform specific groups and the public at large
about greenhouse gas issues. These options will be studied further in the immediate
future, and included in updates to the present CAP. In cases where the Department
would be able to begin implementation of such an option on its own authority, it would be
likely to do so. This group also includes additional options that have been presented by
stakeholders, or identified by the Department, since the June 30, 2003 SAG meeting at
which a final list was presented. Since these have not been subjected to the same
analysis and review process as those in Group1, the Commissioner did not wish to include them in the list of primary recommendations.

Unless otherwise specified, the calculation of carbon savings assumes that a given option is
implemented in 2005. In many cases, time is allowed for the effects of an activity to be fully real-

Several of the non-quantified options identify state actions necessary to the implementation of the Group 1 options. These items would not by themselves produce
carbon savings, so they are not included in Table 1. However, they were identified by
stakeholders as part of the critical path forward. Briefly, they are

cost effectiveness. These indicators are derived from the information in Table 2, where
options are grouped in a 4x2 matrix. This information is presented as follows:

Carbon Savings Potential
High = expected carbon savings of more than 200 KMT annually in 2020;
Moderate = expected carbon savings between 25 and 200 KMT in 2020.
Low = expected annual carbon savings less than 25 KMT in 2020.

High Savings = cost savings of $20 or more per KMT saved in 2020;
Low Savings = cost savings of $0 to $20 per KMT saved in 2020.

May be used in conjunction with a GHG cap and trade

utility of this option for the state could be affected by
the potential adoption of a regional or national GHG
reduction program in the future. Under such a plan,
the state might not receive credit for offsets required by
the state government.

Most Stakeholders agreed that Emission Standards and Offset Requirements should be
included in the plan if they are not duplicative with the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), or if RGGI does not happen. Others could not support these two options
without more information or wanted the numbers re-analyzed to ensure they were actually incremental to RGGI. These could be applied to non-electricity generation facilities,
but stakeholders noted concerns over market fairness issues.
As noted above in Figure 1,53 the consolidated options calculations only include the incremental difference between what RGGI would accomplish, and the additional savings
from this and Option #7.

Maine could propose amending Chapter 127 to include

California GHG tailpipe standards are likely to face legal challenge from automakers on the basis that vehicle CO2 regulation is preempted by federal fuel
economy regulation. New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island have indicated an interest in
implementing the California motor vehicle GHG standards once finalized.

It is important to reduce vehicle GHG emissions rates in the short term because significant vehicle-fleet turnover and associated GHG savings can take a decade or more.
This measure serves as a crucial complement to VMT reduction measures (see 17).

Regional Cap and Trade
Electricity
Set a mandatory cap on the amount of CO2 emitted by
the electricity generation sector. Reductions in emissions
below cap levels result in tradable credits. Entities polluting at levels higher than permitted by the cap are required
to purchase these emission credits. This option shows
the impact of a cap and trade program in New York and
six New England states. The regional CO2 emission cap
was set at 25% below 1990 levels for New York in 2010,
plus 1990 levels for New England in 2010.

If implemented, would displace the need for some of the

Cap and Trade is a market based policy tool for protecting human health and the environment. A cap and trade program first sets a cap, or maximum limit, on emissions.
Sources covered by the program then receive authorizations to emit in the form of emissions allowances, with the total amount of allowances limited by the cap. Each source
can design its own compliance strategy to meet the overall reduction requirement, including sale or purchase of allowances, installation of pollution controls, implementation
of efficiently measures, among other options. Individual control requirements are not
specified under a cap and trade program, but each emissions source must surrender
allowances equal to its actual emissions in order to comply. Sources must also completely and accurately measure and report all emissions in a timely manner to guarantee
that the overall cap is achieved.
Maine is currently involved in a Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) with six New
England States, NY, NJ, and Delaware. Model design and projected savings and costs
should be available in 2005. Previous modeling of six New England states plus NY
showed significant potential savings.

following:
 Gather statewide data on heavy-duty mobile diesel engines and emissions;
 Establish working group to analyze: data, fuel issues, emission control technologies,
costs, benefits, opportunities, case studies, pilot projects;
 Develop recommendations for a Maine Clean Diesel Program;


Regional initiatives –Recommend to the NEG-ECP that bi-national black carbon emissions be studied and considered for inclusion in the GHG inventories
and baselines.

 Federal initiatives –Work with its federal delegation and EPA to increase funding for

diesel retrofit programs, with particular focus on trans-boundary and international
diesel sources (marine, interstate trucking).
The Working Group was divided on how to implement this option, and what incentives
should be provided, which will affect cost and carbon savings. The Department has included this in the list of recommended options because of the large potential GHG savings associated with it. DEP understands that further effort will be required to develop
implementation approaches, particularly because the exact impacts of black carbon remain the subject of ongoing research and analysis.

An SBC funds the same categories of units as the
RPS, or it can be structured to fund other categories of
renewables that would not overlap with an RPS, or
both. For purposes of this analysis it has been modeled to fund the same renewables as the RPS, but only
the reductions from the RPS itself have been included
in the reduction totals to avoid overlap.

No specific mechanism for funding an SBC was proposed by the Working Group or
Stakeholder Advisory Group.
Some Stakeholders suggested that the SBC may not necessary if it is redundant with
the RPS, but no one disagreed with the Working Group recommendations to estimate
the range of GHG savings and cost of saved carbon for using the SBC to support an
RPS or to support emerging technologies not covered by the RPS.

fuel. The goal would be 100% of all fuels by 2020.
Opinions on this option were divided. Some stakeholders preferred passage of a Federal renewable fuel standard, or at least as part of a regional approach initiated through
the Northeast States Consolidated Air Use Management organization. Several state
agencies noted that they did not have explicit authority to support this measure. Opponents expressed concerns about supply, distribution and price volatility.
All representatives to the SAG could support this measure if adopted regionally, but
were not in agreement if implementation was limited to Maine. The SAG also unanimously supported federal renewable fuel standards.

Note that an emission standard may be used in conjunction with a program to offset the CO2 emissions

could be met by averaging emissions across all fossilfired units online in each year, so not every unit would
be required to meet the standard. This is equivalent to
a policy that allows entities to meet standards by purchasing and selling emission credits.

A CO2 emission standard often limits the tons of CO2 per kWh produced. A generation
performance standard, or GPS, is an emission standard covering several pollutants in
one policy / regulation, and can include CO2. Emission standards may allow generators
to meet all or part of the emission limit through purchases of offsets; the carbon sequestered or reduced is then deducted from the actual CO2 emissions from the plant to help
meet the standard. The standards could be placed on the consumer, or on the generator, with different results in either case. Emission standards were assumed to be 900 lb.

Most Stakeholders agreed that Emission Standards and Offset Requirements should be

without more information or wanted the numbers re-analyzed to ensure they were actually incremental to RGGI. One Stakeholder asked that Emission Standards be better
defined.
As noted above in Option #1, the consolidated options calculations only include the incremental difference between what RGGI would accomplish, and the additional savings
from this and Option #1.

At the 6/30 meeting of the Stakeholder Advisory
Group, several members stated that while they supported the overall goal of promoting increased renewable generation, they did not agree that increasing the
RPS was necessarily the appropriate mechanism.

A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) is a market-oriented policy for accelerating the
installation of new renewable resources and technologies into the electricity sector.
Renewable portfolio standards mandate a certain minimum percentage of annual electricity production or sales come from new renewable energy sources. Sources of qualifying renewable energy are delineated in the legislation, as are increased percentage
requirements over time. RPS policies typically include wind and solar, and may include
biomass, hydrogen (produced with renewable energy), tidal and small hydroelectric generation. At present in Maine, wind technologies seem likely to offer the greatest potential.
The Working Group agreed that higher levels should be modeled and explored further;
and costs to consumers should be fully analyzed. Renewable Standards are currently in
place in most other New England States, and New York mandated a 25% RPS by 2013
in September 2004.
66

Fossil-fuel co-generation would not be eligible for the incremental RPS under the terms of proposed legislation.

Legislation to increase Maine RPS in stages was introduced in 2004, but did not come to a
vote. For the PUC Report and Recommendations on the Promotion of Renewable Resources

Would need further state agency and stakeholder planning to adopt a comprehensive approach.

Implementation of this option would translate into protection of 2832 acres of natural forest cover per year that otherwise would have been lost to development. The Working
Group did not recommend a specific implementation approach.
According to recent calculations by Thomas D. Peterson, the total volume of carbon lost
from forestland conversion to non-forest uses in Maine from 1990-2000 was 18.53
MMTC compared to growth in emissions from all sectors of about 22 MMTC during the

through afforestation and stand recovery, but the flow of carbon from forestland conversion appears to be significant.

Reducing volume of decaying wood enhances carbon
sequestration. Increased use of forest biomass for energy generation, paper production, and building materials displaces fossil based energy use of conventional
alternatives.

By definition this option meets market criteria and likely
will not involve new costs to landowners and managers.
Timber harvests will remove anticipated mortality if it is
more profitable than alternative management options.

This option is intended to support timber harvesting that removes anticipated mortality
from the forest with minimal impact to the forest floor and soils, and to use the harvested
wood for energy generation, paper and solid wood production to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions from energy generation and materials production.

Maine already has LEV II but opted (2000) not to include
ZEV mandate because of concerns over limited number
of non-electric vehicles that complied with zero-emission
standard. New alternative path allows ZEV requirement
to be met with current hybrid technology.
Maine adopted CA LEVII for criteria pollutant emissions,

This is expected to be considered by the Legislature,
with earliest possible implementation affecting model
year 2009 vehicles.

The ZEV program was designed to catalyze the commercialization of advancedtechnology vehicles that would not have any tailpipe or evaporative emissions. Originally, the ZEV program required that 2 percent of new vehicles produced for sale in1998
and10 percent of new vehicles produced for sale in 2003 would be zero emission vehicles. The automakers convinced the California Air Resources Board (CARB) that they
could not meet the 1998 deadline, and full implementation of the program was delayed
until 2003. In 2002, automakers sued the state over the program and were granted a
preliminary injunction barring its implementation pending a final court ruling. California
has adopted a revision to its ZEV program, with the aim of restoring it by 2005.
In the Working Group and SAG, a few stakeholders mentioned the following considerations:
1) Dealers being forced to stock vehicles that would be difficult to sell;
2) Minimal CO2 benefit of the option;
3) If not part of this program limited availability of hybrid vehicles.

Organic farming techniques can build up soil carbon levels in farmed acreage. Consistent with the broader policy option to increase soil carbon, the working group did not
formulate an implementation mechanism for increased acreage in
organic farming, and instead suggested simple acreage goals. About 20,000 acres of
farmland in Maine are presently in organic farming out of 155,000 acres of total cultivated cropland. The Maine Organic Farming Association expects this to grow to 30,000
acres by 2010 and then cease to increase. They believe that aggressive public policy
could increase this acreage level to 70,000 acres by 2020 (a 40,000 acre increase).
There is currently no inventory of existing market share of locally grown food in Maine for
a baseline. The goal of 10% of every food dollar was derived from an Iowa study. The
Working Group proposes to increase to this to 15% by 2020.

Direct reporting of CHP facility output.
Developing uniform and consistent interconnection
standards can allow units to be connected to the electricity grid faster and reduce the cost of interconnection.
Utility regulations may need to be changed to encourage CHP; however, this could have the effect of transferring costs to other ratepayers.

CHP systems, also known as co-generation systems, make use of heat that would be
wasted in conventional electric generating plants.
The Working Group agreed that this option should be pursued by exploring the barriers
to CHP, including inter-connection standards,73 environmental standards, and back-up
rates. Any back-up rate proceedings should look at impacts and benefits on CHP owners and other ratepayers.
There may be more opportunities in the institutional and commercial sectors than modeled above and should be further explored. For instance, USM and Eastern ME Medical
are currently installing CHP.
In addition to the implementation methods above, other methods include:

awarding of emission reduction credits to CHP units for emission reductions realized as a result of their high efficiency;

consumer choice, which allows electricity customers to purchase CHP-generated
electricity; and

direct subsidies, provided to CHP units on a per unit, efficiency or energy production basis, which can improve the depreciation allowance for CHP equipment.

Slag is derived from a by-product of the steel industry. It is processed and grounds to
meet strict specifications and sold as a cementitious (cement-like) product. Slag has
cementitious properties and can be used to offset a portion of the cement used in concrete mixtures.77 How much can be offset is dependent on season (winter/summer), set
requirements and other factors.

Although fly ash is another concrete admixture that wold lower the carbon intensity of concrete,
it was not included as part of this Option due to concerns expressed by several Working Group

equipment, they ascend into the atmosphere. They carry with them a CO 2 equivalent
value; for example, CFC-12 has a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 10,600 and
HCFC-22 has a GWP of 1,700. In other words, these compounds have 10,600 and

Nutrient Management
Agriculture
Improve efficiency of fertilizer application by reducing
over-application resulting from incorrect timing. Substitute organic fertilizer (primarily manure) for synthetic
fertilizer, by altering the timing of applications, by altering cover crops and rotational schemes, or by increasing soil testing to improve efficiency (and reduce
unnecessary applications). Specific proposal for potato fertilization: bring 25% of current acreage into new
application practice.
A portion of nitrogen applied to the soil and
not incorporated into plants and soil organic material is
emitted as N2O (a GHG); therefore, a reduction in the
quantity of fertilizer applied or measures that improve
uptake can reduce N2O emissions.
Nutrient Management Law in 1998 (7 M.R.S.A. Chapter 747, Nutrient Management Act); various state and

considerations
Since this process does not reduce the net amount of fertilizer applied, but increases
use in the crop and soil organic layer versus over-application in one large dose, the result is a savings of 40 pounds per acre of fertilizer. This will be fully incorporated by
crops and not applied in excess (660,000 pounds nitrogen saved).

The chief plant considered for repowering was the oilfired William Wyman facility, which accounted for 37% of
emissions from electric power in 2000. However, subsequent research has indicated that the plant is likely a
poor candidate for repowering due to the fact that it operates as a peaking unit with a low capacity factor and
the high potential costs involved. Other potential fossil
facilities in Maine are either closed or used for peaking
only, making repowering impractical.
Based on discussions with Maine DEP, it is proposed
that this option be transferred from immediate to longterm consideration for ongoing monitoring and future
