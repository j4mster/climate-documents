The Plan will be a living document that will evolve over time as new strategies,
resources, technologies, and collaborations come to light. This Plan sets the
framework for cross-sector collaboration between subject-matter experts, local
businesses, community stakeholders, and residents alike to help put Mesa on the
path to carbon neutrality. We will look to the community to help us develop a
pathway of equitable and inclusive initiatives based on data, best practices, and
local expertise that will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions each year.
We know what we need to do. The Plan provides a pathway to accelerate our
historical success so that we can more positively contribute to the global climate
action impacts. We want Mesa to continue to be a vibrant, prosperous, and
thriving city for generations to come.

SUSTAINABILITY: Sustainability means meeting the needs of today without compromising the ability to meet
the needs of tomorrow for future generations (Sustainability, 2021). To support our natural environment, this
means we must cultivate conditions where humans and nature can flourish together. The City embraces the three
common pillars of sustainability: planet, people, and prosperity, to guide and frame decisions with environmental
impacts.

CO-BENEFITS: The ability to have positive impacts in multiple areas at once. Many of the actions in the Plan
have numerous co-benefits in addition to reducing emissions. For example, actions that reduce vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) may also result in cost-savings by lowering transportation expenses and improving environmental
quality by decreasing vehicle emissions. Consideration of these added benefits is an opportunity to prioritize
actions that also positively impact other needs.

CARBON NEUTRALITY: Carbon neutrality means having a balance between the emission of carbon dioxide
and other GHGs, with removal or mitigation measures intended to achieve net-zero carbon. For the City, this
means reducing carbon emissions from buildings, transportation, waste, and our energy supply as much as
possible, and supporting activities that remove carbon from the atmosphere (carbon offsets) to compensate for
any remaining emissions.

Ch 3. Measuring City’s Impact:
Understanding Mesa’s Greenhouse
Gas Emissions

What is a G H G Inventory ?
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) defines a
GHG inventory as a list of emission sources and the associated emissions
quantified using standardized methods. Maricopa County Air Quality
Department prepared this GHG emissions inventory to give our community
an understanding of Mesa’s emissions. By understanding the sources of GHG
emissions, leaders can make operational decisions and implement voluntary
programs to reduce GHG emissions within our community. Businesses and
individuals can also make personal choices to reduce their GHG emissions.

H ere is M esa’s G H G inventory and w hat it t e l l s u s:

CARBON DIOXIDE (CO2): Carbon dioxide enters the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels (oil,
natural gas, and coal), solid waste, trees, and wood products; and also as a result of other chemical reactions
(e.g., manufacture of cement). Carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere (or “sequestered”) when it is
absorbed by plants as part of the biological carbon cycle.

METHANE (CH4): Methane is emitted during the production and transport of coal, natural gas, and oil.
Methane emissions also result from livestock and other agricultural practices and by the decay of organic
waste in municipal solid waste landfills.
NITROUS OXIDE (N2O): Nitrous oxide is emitted during agricultural and industrial activities, as well as
during combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste. N2O is commonly found in vehicle tailpipe emissions.
FLUORINATED GASES: Hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride are synthetic,
powerful GHGs that are emitted from a variety of industrial processes. Fluorinated gases are sometimes
used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (i.e., CFCs, HCFCs, and halons). These gases are typically
emitted in smaller quantities, but because they are potent GHGs, they are sometimes referred to as High
Global Warming Potential gases (“High GWP gases”).

MESA GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY SOURCE**
Mobile Sources
43.1%

Stationary Fuel
Combustion
10.6%

How much is in the atmosphere? Concentration, or abundance, is the amount of a particular gas in the
air. Larger emissions of GHGs lead to higher concentrations in the atmosphere. GHG concentrations are
measured in parts per million, parts per billion, and even parts per trillion. One part per million is equivalent
to one drop of water diluted into about 13 gallons of liquid (roughly the fuel tank of a compact car).

Other
5.2%

How long do they remain in the atmosphere? Each of these gases can remain in the atmosphere for different
amounts of time, ranging from a few years to thousands of years. All of these gases remain in the atmosphere
long enough to become well mixed, meaning that the amount that is measured in the atmosphere is roughly
the same all over the world, regardless of the original emission source.
How strongly do they impact the atmosphere? For each GHG, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) has been
calculated to reflect how long it remains in the atmosphere, on average, and how strongly it absorbs energy.
Gases with a higher GWP absorb more energy, per pound, than gases with a lower GWP, and thus contribute
more to warming Earth. (Agency, 2021)

The items we purchase, and the management of this
material can emit many times more greenhouse gases
than that of the energy used in our homes, businesses
and schools. We should all think about sustainable
alternatives to the things we purchase and use every
day – use a reusable water bottle, reusable grocery
bags, and buy only what we really need. These
actions save energy, save water, and protect our
natural resources. Recycling is great but reducing
and reusing should always be our first choice in
managing our waste. If we don’t create waste, we
don’t have to worry about what to do with it.

Financial Investments
The City is committed to ongoing financial investments to help meet our climate
action goals. Current City operations that include sustainable initiatives are
fully funded under an existing, adopted budget. Each year the City Council
reviews and approves budgets with proposed new projects and full fiscal impact
analysis. Although the actions outlined in the Plan are designed to demonstrate
a pathway to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, there is much uncertainty in
predicting future technologies, costs, and regulations. Therefore, the City will
continue to use its annual budget process as a mechanism to evaluate programs,
projects, and services with the environmental lens, and adjust associated costs
accordingly as new resources emerge and mature.

I. Introduction
Climate change is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century. The City of Mesa (City) recognizes
the consensus among leading scientists that without action to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
the average temperature of the earth’s surface will continue to rise. The Mesa community collectively
possesses the skills, knowledge, and resources that can be harnessed to create solutions to mitigate
Mesa’s climate impact. Taking action needs to include all local community partners, as well as support at
the state and national levels. Everyone has a role, and everyone must do their part, both on a personal
level and at the community level. If we think globally and act locally, we can collaboratively address the
impacts of climate change together.
In June 2021 the City took a critical step in affirming its commitment to protect and conserve Mesa’s
environment with the adoption of its first Mesa Climate Action Plan (MCAP). The MCAP is a Mayor
and Council priority initiative to reduce GHG emissions, build resilience in the community and address
the negative outcomes of a changing climate. The MCAP establishes policy directive, sets targets, and
describes strategies that will increase sustainability in City operations.
The MCAP includes four ‘Aspirational Goals’ to provide a vision and guide for the future:

Carbon Neutrality

Achieve carbon neutrality by
2050 by reducing greenhouse
gas emissions and enhancing
carbon sinks
Strive to reduce the carbon
footprint of City Operations by
50% by 2030

Renewable Energy

Materials Management

Community Action

Prioritize the use of
renewable, resilient energy
to achieve 100% rewnewable
energy by 2050

Manage material
ressponsibility and divert
90% waste from the landfill
by 2050

Develop community
based action items to be
incorporated into the Plan

This supplemental Community Action Study (Study) seeks to support Aspirational Goal 4, to gain
understanding on the community-based action that can be taken to reduce GHG emissions. Through
a robust community engagement process, the Study seeks to discover initiatives built on community
values.

Study Objective

The primary objective of this study is to enhance the MCAP with community-based action items, striving
to reflect the viewpoints, priorities and needs of all Mesa residents, neighborhoods, businesses, and
stakeholders. Through this effort, the City is seeking a pathway of equitable and inclusive initiatives
based on data, best practices, and proposed community-based actions that will reduce GHG emissions
each year.

II. Study Approach
To maximize the opportunities and reach of community engagement the City combined aspects of this
Study with the development of the Parks, Recreation and Community Facilities (PRCF) Comprehensive
Plan. Both efforts seek to develop a collective vision to make Mesa a more vibrant, prosperous, and
thriving city for generations to come. The aligned endeavor provides efficiency and effectiveness in
marketing, and staff resources. This combined effort is branded “Footprint for the Future.”

This Study commenced in August of 2021 and concluded with findings and final recommendations at
the start of 2022. A Project Team comprised of staff from the City Manager’s Office and the Department
of Environmental Management and Sustainability was assembled to guide the development and
implementation of outreach opportunities.
Community engagement efforts included:
• Community Workshops
• On-line Engagement through an interactive platform
• Virtual Public Meetings
• Climate Action Prioritization Survey
The MCAP is organized into six (6) focus areas to guide City efforts to ensure a healthy environment.
Reduction targets have been established for each focus area. Where possible, engagement opportunities
were planned around the six focus areas.

Community Workshops

Community workshops provide an opportunity to inform, consult, involve, and collaborate. The City
hosted six community workshops between September 14, 2021 – September 23, 2021 with the goal
to gather input on climate action as well as PRCF services from resident stakeholders. The collective
attendance for the workshop series was 127 community members.
Dot voting, also known as “sticker voting”, “dotmocracy” or “voting with dots” was the facilitation
method used throughout the workshop series. It is an established form of cumulative voting. Dot-voting
is a technique to identify problems or prioritize a long list of options or ideas. It allows participants to
express a preference for more than one option at the same time.
At each workshop participants were asked to use dot voting to reflect the level of importance each of the
following climate change impacts are to them:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Drought/ Decreased seasonal rainfall
Extreme Heat/Temperatures (Temps above 110, Heat-Related Illness, etc.)
Hardship on Future Generations
Human Health Impacts (Allergies, Mental Health, Diseases, etc.)
Impacts on Agriculture and Food Production (Water and Food Supply)
Loss of Biodiversity such as Wildlife, Species, and Ecosystems
Power Outages, Availability of Electricity and Natural Gas Supply
Reduced Air Quality (Asthma, Cardiovascular Disease)
Severe Weather Events (Increased Flooding, High Winds, Monsoons, Dust Storms, etc.)

Four climate change impacts received the most interaction at 75 or more votes marked “very
important”:
•
•
•
•

Drought/Decreased seasonal rainfall
Reduced Air Quality (Asthma, Cardiovascular Disease)
Extreme Heat/Temperatures (Temps above 110, Heat-Related Illness, etc.)
Impacts on Agriculture and Food Production (Water and Food Supply)

Workshop participants were next asked to evaluate a list of community actions they are currently taking
or are willing to take to limit climate impacts.
Four community actions received the most interaction at 50 or more total votes:
•
•
•
•

Plant trees
Eat locally grown fruits and vegetables
Buy greener products and avoid single use items (i.e., water bottles, etc.)
Repair and reuse items

Figure 1: Workshop Outcomes – Community Action

Online Engagement

Bang the Table was used to host the project website, footprintfuturemesa.com. The multilingual online
platform provided information about the MCAP and offered a mechanism for community members
to contribute their ideas. The website utilized polls, an ideas board, and an online survey to gather
community thoughts, priorities, and perspectives. The website launched in early September and
remained in use through February 2022. During that time the website had over 6,000 visits and 2,297
“Engaged Visitors”. A visitor is considered ‘engaged’ if they contribute or provide feedback to on the site.
Appendix A provides a summary of site engagement.

Polls

Polls encourage people to provide a quick answer to one question, selecting from multiple choice
answers. They are able to instantly see the poll results, piquing their interest and giving real-time insight.
For this study two polls were used to gauge sentiment for reducing the effects of climate change. The
results showed community members believe if the community works together the negative effects of
climate change can be reduced (74% agree or strongly agree).

Table 1: Focus Area Ideas

The idea that received the most traffic and support is to “Promote Teleworking”.
“If local governments and local companies offered more days of teleworking
there would be less automotive travel on a daily basis.”
Another idea that received heavy visitor traffic and support was Solar Shade.
“More parking lots, playgrounds, outdoor areas, etc. with shade structures
that have solar panels on top of them. We have sun almost every day of the
year, its a shame to waste it.”
Appendix B includes all visitor generated ideas.

Virtual Public Meetings

In October and November 2021, a virtual lunchtime meeting series was conducted over six (6)
consecutive weeks. The goal was to carry out focused engagement targeted at each of the MCAP Focus
Areas. Each session included a brief overview of the MCAP and its goals, a short presentation on an
MCAP Focus Area and an open forum for participants to share ideas and values.
Meeting registrations ranged from 69 – 90 individuals with an overall attendance rate of 33%. According
to ON24 Webinar Benchmarks Report: COVID-19 Special Edition the typical webinar conversion rate for
this size audience is approximately 35%. Additionally, the report found one-third (34%) of registrants
access the on-demand version only, demonstrating the need to make webinars available to audiences on
their terms. Videos from the meeting series were emailed to all registrants and uploaded on to project
website. A review of registration, percentage of attendance rates, and YouTube views finds the focus
area that received the most interest was Energy.

Climate Action Prioritization Survey
An online Climate Action Prioritization Survey (Survey) was conducted to garner feedback for the
prioritization of climate action initiatives. Questions were drafted based on information gathered
through the Community Workshop series, and project website.
The Survey was publicized through email lists, newsletters, ads on social media, public meetings, etc. A
total of 2,221 responses were received. It is important to note that the survey is not random, so is not a
statistically-valid survey. Therefore, it is not solely relied upon for determining recommendations, but did
help shape and inform the key findings.
The Survey was open from mid-October through January 2022. Thirteen (13) questions asked about
climate action priorities and potential community initiatives to reduce GHG emissions. The Survey report
(provided in Appendix C) includes a wealth of information to help guide the prioritization of climate
action initiatives.
In regard to the climate related hazards surveyed, the majority of respondents viewed all threats as very
concerning.

PRCF Comprehensive Plan Survey
Similar questions related to views on climate action were included as part of the PRCF Comprehensive
Plan statistically-valid survey. The PRCF survey was conducted using three primary methods: 1) a mailed
invite survey to 4,200 households in Mesa, 2) an online, password protected invitation website, 3) an
open link survey for all other residents who were not included in invitation sample. Results are kept
separate to maintain the statistical validity of the invitation sample. A total of 2,402 responses for the
PCRF survey were received.
Through the statistically-valid survey respondents rated all 12-actions identified to limit climate change
as important or very important. The overall respondent rating reveals that a resilient water supply and a
tree and shade plan are of the highest importance to respondents.

Figure 5: Statistically-Valid Survey: Important City Actions to Limit Climate Change

A follow-up question asked respondents to select their top three most urgent climate actions for the City
to address. The overall responses show a resilient water supply was the top choice for nearly half of all
respondents. There is also strong interest in programs to improve air quality and a tree and shade plan.

III. Equitable Engagement
Understanding the demographics of Mesa residents is important because it is reflective of the
diverse history, and values of the community. This type of information can assist the City in outreach
opportunities that are relevant and meaningful to all City residents. Knowing that an estimated 30
percent of Mesa’s population identifies as Hispanic, designing an inclusive engagement approach is a
priority in developing community-based actions that will reduce GHG emissions each year.

Equitable and inclusive engagement is not only about ensuring that diverse perspectives are at the
table but also that deliberate actions and targeted strategies are taken to ensure that underrepresented
communities participate and contribute. To validate inclusive participation, where appropriate,
participants were asked to provide demographic information.
Throughout the Study providing equitable opportunities was at the forefront. Marketing material for
outreach activities were developed in English and Spanish, bi-lingual staff were present at each of the
six Community Workshops, and the project website was multilingual. For a complete list of marketing
channels used in the Study see Appendix D.

IV. Community Climate Action Implementation Strategies
Climate action depends on successfully communicating information about the MCAP to the wider Mesa
community and encouraging broader participation in climate-related activities as the plan moves into
implementation. GHG emissions reductions goals will not be met without the community playing a major
role. This chapter outlines strategies to assist with an inclusive approach to implementing community
action within the MCAP.

Partnerships

Community partnerships have been emerging as an important pathway to various types of local
solutions. As the MCAP continues in its implementation, it will be important to map out and align the
general roles and responsibilities of the City, the community as a whole, and potential key partners that
will support MCAP. Community climate action is a collaborative, all-hands-on effort, and all partners in
the community are needed to engage, support, and implement the MCAP together.
The City and community stakeholders will need to periodically assess their own roles and make pivots or
shifts as needed. By continuing to reflect on how implementation approaches are progressing, the
Mesa community can take lessons learned and apply them in implementing other planned strategies
moving forward. Understanding the role of the City and of the community can provide a foundation
for maximizing the collective impact on climate change. These ongoing partnerships can also optimize
implementation actions and communications to support resilience and equitable outcomes.

Education and Outreach

Education and outreach will be vital as the MCAP moves through it’s implementation and beyond.
Continued education with schools (early education, primary, community colleges and universities),
community organizations who have large networks of members, and other partners are essential to
move climate efforts forward. Strategies in this area will include continuing to build partnerships with
thought leaders, technical experts, non-profits, youth, and community leaders for climate action.
Education will work to create positive community-led action, broad-based support, and a sense of
ownership for the MCAP. One of the most effective ways to educate the public on climate change
impacts is the use of storytelling. The City and its partners may use narrative text grounded in the realworld experiences and concerns of the Mesa community to effectively communicate about climate
change impacts in the area.

Tracking and Ongoing Communications

Ongoing communication, tracking performance, benchmarking, providing storytelling, and sharing
lessons learned related to action implementation are vital to the success of MCAP. As part of the
Prioritization Survey 18% of respondents expressed, they would be more likely to participate in climate
solution activities if they knew the City was also taking action.
Some of the ways the City can demonstrate their ongoing action is through regular website and social
media updates, continued education programs and news releases on large scale projects. Additionally,
MCAP stakeholder feedback will keep the community informed about the implementation of the plan’s
actions and strategies, and progress toward climate goals. Moreover, monitoring provides concrete data
to document the City’s progress in reducing GHG emissions. Cities across the country are implementing
annual reports and Open Data Portal to track progress on climate mitigation activities.

V. Recommendations
The main purpose of this endeavor has been to develop a pathway of equitable and inclusive
community-based initiatives that will support the City’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by reducing
GHG emissions by 2050. The extensive effort undertaken during this Study has brought to light key
findings that are critical to addressing potential community actions that can be encouraged and applied
in Mesa.
Individuals and community groups have an important role to play in reaching the MCAP climate action
goals. Through collective, committed, and caring actions from all, Mesa can achieve carbon neutrality
goals and become a more vibrant, prosperous, and carbon-neutral community for generations to come.
Through a diverse and comprehensive outreach effort priorities to reduce climate change and viewpoints
on City led initiatives to mitigate the effects of climate change emerged:
Priorities
Responsible Water Management
Improve Air Quality
Transition to Renewable Energy
City initiatives viewed as providing the most benefit to mitigating the effects of climate change
Resilient water supply
Tree and shade plan
Increase renewable energy infrastructure
Community-based initiatives should align with identified priorities. Importance is placed on initiatives
that the community has identified as providing the highest benefit in mitigating the effects of climate
change.
The tables below present key recommendations to drive community action for the MCAP.
Recommendations have been developed and grouped into the following four focus areas:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Education
Ongoing Communication
Strategic Partnerships
Funding and Incentives

The recommendations are intended to act as a catalyst and internal work plan. As the MCAP
implementation begins and continues over time, engagement and leadership will be vital to MCAP
success.

4.1

4.2

32

Investigate and leverage public financing opportunities at the local, state,
and federal levels to support MCAP implementation and a public awareness
campaign. There may be opportunities to leverage funding in government
agencies that may not traditionally be seen as climate-related, such as housing,
health and human services, general services, economic development, emergency
response, and transportation.
Seek to embed sustainability and climate action into existing funding and grant
programs, including private foundation grants and private financing.

VI. Conclusion
This Study has been an examination of viewpoints, priorities and needs of Mesa residents,
neighborhoods, businesses, and stakeholders to identify community-based action items to support
GHG reduction goals. Climate change is a global challenge that the City cannot overcome alone.
Successful implementation of the MCAP will rely heavily on the collective action of everyone in the Mesa
community.
It has been our pleasure to assist the City and to work with the Environmental Management and
Sustainability Department to develop a pathway of equitable and inclusive initiatives to reduce GHG
emissions each year. As a living plan, the MCAP will evolve with the community over time to effectively
support the City in achieving the MCAP aspirational goal of carbon neutrality through GHG emission
reduction by 2050.

Solar and encourage reusing
True Energy Independence Any plans to discuss clean energy needs to include
nuclear. If you do not consider nuclear energy as a
viable option to achieve clean energy with minimal
environmental impact then you are not actually
serious about this issue. Nuclear is clean, produces
zero carbon emissions, produces zero air pollutants, is
highly containable to a small geographic region, and is
energy rich. These things need to be considered since
the technology for safe, clean power from nuclear
already exists. We do not need to wait for decades for
efficient solar or wind technologies to be made readily
available to the public. We do not need to waste large
amounts of land for gigantic solar or wind fields where
nothing else can develop. We also do not need to fill
our landfills with the dead equipment of solar and
wind technologies with their own environmentally
toxic components.
Don’t blame humans
I disagree! Human activity is not largely responsible
for climate change. It’s due to divine design of natural
physical forces of the Earth.
GHG Impact Assessments
Pavement, sprawl, construction materials,
for future development
induced traffic all has GHG consequences. In
proposals.
the development of Mesa’s land use patterns/
decisions and transportation options have largely
ignored these impacts and let concerns of traffic
congestion and level of service mandate certain
development outcomes. GHG Impacts should be
considered to balance the Traffic Impacts that only
see more pavement as a positive. See Smart Growth
guidance, green infrastructure, and energy-efficient
development design as long been advised by the EPA.
Corridors for high-quality
Prioritize corridors of the city that are prime for infill
transit
along key routes for transformative land-use and
transportation morphology for sustainable outcomes.

Climate Change, and Health
Quoting the abstract: “The earth’s climate is changing,
due largely to greenhouse gas emissions resulting
from human activity. These human-generated gases
derive in part from aspects of the built environment
such as transportation systems and infrastructure,
building construction and operation, and landuse planning. Transportation, the largest end-use
consumer of energy, affects human health directly
through air pollution and subsequent respiratory
effects, as well as indirectly through physical activity
behavior. Buildings contribute to climate change,
influence transportation, and affect health through
the materials utilized, decisions about sites, electricity
and water usage, and landscape surroundings.”

In terms of the local government responsibility,
transportation policy is largely in the government’s
hands. Local control of right-of-way is a public asset,
but it’s also a liability when it’s impacts generate
long-term harm to the climate/ecosystem, harm
human lives, and burden economic sustainability
with heavy tax burdens for unfunded maintenance
projections. No private investment can alter the
transportation system in the ways that public policy
and transportation systems design can. THIS MAKES
IT THE CITY’S RESPONSIBILITY TO PRIORITIZE THE
CLIMATE RESPONSE IN TRANSPORTATION.”
More parking lots, playgrounds, outdoor areas, etc.
with shade structures that have solar panels on top of
them. We have sun almost every day of the year, its a
shame to waste it.
All new construction in Mesa (houses and multi-family
dwellings with garages) should including appropriate
wiring to be electric vehicle-ready. Negligible cost
compared to having to re-wire an existing dwelling
later which might be a deterrent to purchasing an EV.

Description
We need to update building codes to ensure that new
constructions are not utilizing natural gas or oil for
heating, and perhaps are required to be prepared for
or already have on-site renewable energy generation.
I also think that any open parking lots should be
covered with solar structures, shading and protecting
vehicles from sun damage and excessive heat while
also providing power to the grid. Solar won’t be the
answer for all our energy needs, but covering vacant
space and rooftops will significantly help lower our
fossil fuel dependence while providing the city with
other benefits like shade.
Personal fireworks should be banned except for
holidays and enforce no burn days. People near
downtown shoot fireworks very late at night.
Invest in prevention and keep waste out of landfills
and enable better food diversion/donation programs.
Each year, between 30-40% of all food in the US is
unsold or uneaten. That’s $408 billion worth of food—
roughly 2% of US GDP—and about 4% of US GHG
emissions. Most becomes food waste, heading straight
to landfill, incineration, down the drain, or it's left in
the fields be tilled back under. All while millions face
hunger and our ecosystems are degraded.

unsold or uneaten. That’s $408 billion worth of food—
roughly 2% of US GDP—and about 4% of US GHG
emissions. Most becomes food waste, heading straight
to landfill, incineration, down the drain, or it's left in
the fields be tilled back under. All while millions face
hunger and our ecosystems are degraded.
The recycling center has been burned down for years
so nothing is actually getting recycled. The fees we
paid for “recycling” should rebuilt.
We have to plan for less water. Lawns everywhere,
except parks, need to go, and houses should be using
recycled water.
whole-house hot H20 recirc pumps required in ALL
new homes being built could save THOUSANDS of
gallons of H20 every year during the life of every
home, simple AND inexpensive if installed during
construction

It would be nice to see Mesa implement incentives or
fines (depending on motivation) to property owners
that remove trees along public areas without replacing
them. We've watched hundreds of trees be removed
in the last 3 years, with very little effort made to
replace them. Trees are good for our community both
aesthetically and environmentally.

Unless you can provide real evidence that this is true,
there is no reason to take this opinion seriously.

Whatever your beliefs and sources are about the

and we have to do something about it so that our
community and futures can live in safer, more resilient
and smarter environments. Try to contribute to
solutions and we will be a better community for it.

Title
Teach people HOW to
recycle PROPERLY

Description

Votes

Visitors

The problem with recycling is that people don't know
how to do it properly, which causes recycling centers
to take on the expenses incurred because of it, and
their machines to get messed up from plastic in the
recycle bins in Mesa. I would suggest LARGE and
CLEAR visual instructions NEXT to the recycling bins
(not on the lids which nobody sees). Most people
don't want to put effort into looking up what items
can be recycled and instead "wishcycle" with the
hope that whatever they throw into the containers
will be recycled, but they are causing more harm than
good. The city could educate people about alternative
recycling drop-offs too, such as the local Household
Hazardous Materials Facility, styrofoam center in
Tempe, clothing & textile bins, and store drop-offs
for certain plastics. When people have the proper
knowledge, see how easy it can be to collect and drop
off their items (pair it with an errand for example),
and understand the benefits of doing so, they may be
more likely to do recycle the right way. They can lead
by example. I'm the type of person that will drive to
Scottsdale to drop off my recycling (locations on their
website) because they accept so many more items,
and I'll drop things off at all the places mentioned
above. It did take some time to research it all, but now
that I know exactly what to do, I'm set for all my future
recycling needs, and it can be this easy for everyone
else too if the information is provided to them, minus
the upfront research!

Seek Co-Benefit Solutions:
The Built Environment,
Climate Change, and Health

Description
Reduce consumption of animal products - many
scientists have said this is the main way we can help
decrease greenhouse gas emissions.
People contribute time, money or resources and in
return have fresh food for their families.
Join MARCo, codify food system health into the
General Plan update, zoning code, and subdivision

ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(08)00682-X/
fulltext
Quoting the abstract: "The earth's climate is changing,
due largely to greenhouse gas emissions resulting
from human activity. These human-generated gases
derive in part from aspects of the built environment
such as transportation systems and infrastructure,
building construction and operation, and landuse planning. Transportation, the largest end-use
consumer of energy, affects human health directly
through air pollution and subsequent respiratory
effects, as well as indirectly through physical activity
behavior. Buildings contribute to climate change,
influence transportation, and affect health through
the materials utilized, decisions about sites, electricity
and water usage, and landscape surroundings."
In terms of the local government responsibility,
transportation policy is largely in the government's
hands. Local control of right-of-way is a public asset,
but it's also a liability when it's impacts generate
long-term harm to the climate/ecosystem, harm
human lives, and burden economic sustainability
with heavy tax burdens for unfunded maintenance
projections. No private investment can alter the
transportation system in the ways that public policy
and transportation systems design can. THIS MAKES
IT THE CITY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO PRIORITIZE THE
CLIMATE RESPONSE IN TRANSPORTATION.

Urban Aeroponic Farming

Sustainable Classes

Comment response to
"community vegetable
gardens"

Description
Companies such as Bowery and AeroFarms have
revolutionized farming of staples such as lettuce,
arugula, and spices like basil, oregano, cilantro, etc.
By utilizing old warehouse and industrial buildings
to build vertical aeroponic farms, massive quantities
of food can be grown all year round with far greater
efficiency than traditional farming. The best part
is, not only does this utilize abandoned buildings
and land and create jobs within the city, but it
also significantly reduces the need for dangerous
pesticides, and greatly reduces emissions related with
the transport of the produce, as it is grown directly
within the city. The City of Mesa should try to invite
a company like this to our city to create a farm of
this kind, that will use far less water and land but still
provide essential food items to much of our city’s
population.
Classes/resources of how to start and maintain a
successful, sustainable square-foot garden. More seed
sharing programs.
