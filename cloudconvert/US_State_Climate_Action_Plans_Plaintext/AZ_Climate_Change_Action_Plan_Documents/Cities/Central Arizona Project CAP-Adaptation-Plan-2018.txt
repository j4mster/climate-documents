1.0 Introduction and Background
The Central Arizona Project (CAP) provides renewable water supply to central and southern Arizona,
where about 80 percent of the population of Arizona resides. This water supply comes from the Colorado
River Basin and is subject to priority administration during drought. Recent drought, as well as studies on
the potential impacts of climate change, have put a fine point on the need for CAP to be prepared for
changing conditions. A prolonged shortage in the Colorado River Basin due to persistent drought could
cause CAP to suffer a reduction in water diversions from the river. In addition, drier and warmer conditions
may have broader effects on water demand, the economy, and the financial security of CAP. It follows
that climate change could have far-reaching effects throughout the CAP organization. The purpose of the
climate adaptation project described herein is to investigate the potential effects of climate change across
CAP departments, and develop a plan to increase the resiliency of CAP.
This section provides background information about CAP, climate change in general, and specific climate
change concerns for CAP. Following this background section, this report contains the following sections:

Central Arizona Project

1.1.1

History and Mission

During the early 1900s, the seven states of the Colorado River Basin, Arizona, California, Nevada, New
Mexico, Wyoming, Colorado and Utah, apportioned Colorado River water. In 1922, representatives from
the seven Basin States and the United States government created the Colorado River Compact, which
divided the states into Lower and Upper Basins and gave each basin 7.5 million acre-feet of water to
apportion. Arizona1, California, and Nevada were sectioned into the Lower Basin, and were instructed to
divide their 7.5 million acre-foot allotment among themselves.
Arizona was in dispute over its share of the river, however, and was the last state to approve the Compact
in 1944. Today in the Lower Basin, Arizona has rights to 2.8 million acre feet of Colorado River water per
year, California is entitled to 4.4 million acre feet per year and Nevada has an annual allocation of 300,000
acre feet. One acre foot of water equals 325,851 gallons, the annual amount used by three families of
four.
In 1946, the Central Arizona Project Association was formed to educate Arizonans about the need for the
CAP and to lobby Congress to authorize its construction. It took the next 22 years to do so, and in 1968,
President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a bill authorizing construction of the CAP. The bill directed the
Secretary of the Interior to construct the CAP and contract for delivery of the CAP water supply and
repayment of reimbursable costs.
In 1971, at the request of the Secretary, the Central Arizona Water Conservation District (CAWCD) was
created to provide a single entity to repay the federal government for the reimbursable costs of
construction and contract for the delivery of CAP water. Construction began at Lake Havasu in 1973 and
was completed 20 years later south of Tucson. Now, the CAP is the steward of central Arizona's Colorado
1 A small portion of Arizona’s Colorado River Water comes from the Upper Basin Apportionment.

River water entitlement, roughly 1.5 million acre feet, and a collaborative leader in Arizona's water
community.
CAP's service area is comprised of three counties in central and southern Arizona – Maricopa, Pinal and
Pima. This 24,000 square mile area (approximately 20 percent of the state), includes 5.3 million people,
which is approximately 81 percent of the state's population. The CAP system serves a variety of water
users within the service area, including 55 municipal subcontractors, 10 Native American tribes, and a
number of agricultural and excess water customers every year.
CAP's Mission:
CAP is the steward of central Arizona’s Colorado River water entitlement and a collaborative leader in
Arizona’s water community.
CAP’s Vision:
The CAP will be a collaborative, innovative leader in the management and the delivery of water to central
Arizona. It will enhance the state’s economy and quality of life and ensure sustainable growth for current
and future populations of Arizonans.

1.1.2

Organizational Structure

CAP’s organizational structure is managed by the CAP Management Council which includes the General
Manager, the Deputy General Manager, General Counsel, and several Directors. The Management Council
oversees the following groups within the organization:
Water Policy
The Water Policy Group manages and oversees long-range planning, policy analysis and development and
program implementation for the CAP Service Area, the Colorado River, and the Central Arizona
Groundwater Replenishment District (CAGRD).
The CAGRD helps property owners and water providers in the Phoenix, Tucson, and Pinal Active
Management Areas (AMAs) without access to sufficient renewable water supplies to demonstrate the
required 100-year assured water supply under Arizona law. Currently, 23 water providers and cities, as
well as more than 260,000 homes, rely on the CAGRD for this purpose. For more than 20 years, the CAGRD
has played a critical role in the state’s successful water management program and has contributed to the
State of Arizona’s economic growth and development. The CAGRD is statutorily obligated to develop or
acquire renewable water supplies as needed to replace the groundwater pumped by its members. The
CAGRD uses a variety of water supplies to meet this obligation.
The Colorado River Programs department works collaboratively with stakeholders in Arizona, the
Colorado River Basin States, and the federal governments of the United States and Mexico to ensure
reliable water supplies are available to meet CAP's customers' needs. Colorado River Programs support
CAP's strategic objectives by influencing the management of the Colorado River system to optimize the
supply available to CAP, developing new water supplies to augment the Colorado River, protecting CAP's
Colorado River water supply, evaluating and managing risks posed to CAP from climate change and
prolonged drought, and implementing water management programs to reduce the risk of shortages to
CAP.
Resource Planning and Analysis staff perform a variety of long-range water resource planning activities
within the CAP service area, including supply and demand forecasting, shortage impact and reliability
analyses, and projections of CAGRD’s replenishment obligation. Resource Planning and Analysis staff are
also actively engaged in a number of specific processes, including development of a framework for
wheeling non-Project water, recovery of credits stored by the Arizona Water Banking Authority, and
development of the CAGRD's Plan of Operation. To support CAP’s long-range planning activities, Resource
Planning and Analysis develops and maintains models, planning data, and GIS capabilities.

Operations and Engineering
The Operations and Engineering Group is responsible for operational control of the water supply facilities,
deliveries to customers, accounting for water diversion and deliveries, engineering support for
maintenance and capital improvement of CAP’s facilities, administration of CAP lands, and management
of CAP power and transmission resources. The group consists of three departments, discussed below.
Engineering Administration is comprised of Engineering Services, Engineering Resources, and Engineering
Project Management. The mission of Engineering Services is to provide engineering expertise, direction,
service, and support to CAP. Engineering Resources is responsible for the design of asset modifications,
code compliance review and adoption, support of construction projects, and the creation and
maintenance of standard operating procedures. Engineering Project Management provides construction
management services for all major capital improvements. Engineering administration services also include
oversight of CAP land and technical records, land surveying, inspection services, and drafting services.
The Water Operations Department (which includes Water Control and Water Systems) is dedicated to the
safe operation of the CAP system in order to protect people, property, and equipment while optimizing
CAP’s water resources. The Water Operations department is responsible for the safe and efficient
operation of the CAP canal and all its facilities. In addition to efficiently operating the canal and pumping
plants to deliver CAP water to central Arizona customers, Water Operations also provides water
accounting, water use forecasting, and hydraulic and hydrologic engineering services.
In conjunction with Water Operations, the Power Programs department performs forecasting and
accounting of energy use, transmission, and generation for the CAP system. Power Programs also
manages CAP’s energy portfolio, including rights to Navajo Generation Station power, contracts to power
from Hoover Dam, and power marketing contracts.
Maintenance and Reliability
Maintenance and Reliability is responsible for the effective application of industry best practices in the
delivery of maintenance and equipment reliability. It consists of departments that protect and preserve
the integrity and capacity of CAP’s water delivery system and related infrastructure through proactive
reliability-based maintenance practices.
Reliability Engineers are responsible for the preventive maintenance programs and reliability of CAP’s
assets. They monitor the performance and reliability of the water delivery system and adjust the
preventive maintenance procedures, frequencies, and technologies to improve reliability and cost
effectiveness as needed. Maintenance Engineers are responsible for Reliability Centered Maintenance
(RCM) implementation and preventive maintenance procedures. They serve as a liaison between
Reliability Engineers and the maintenance groups to ensure the proper execution of routine and
reoccurring maintenance activities as well as individual, extraordinary maintenance activities as required
to ensure the reliable function of CAP's infrastructure.
Maintenance Planning coordinates the maintenance business processes and serve as “hub” of the
maintenance operation. Maintenance Planners develop work packages, job plans, and schedules as
required to coordinate manpower, materials, tools, specialty equipment, contracts, and permits in order
to provide execution ready work that can be completed in the most efficient manner
possible. Maintenance Planning is involved in all maintenance work at CAP including preventive
activities, corrective work, asset modifications, and predictive technologies.
Work Execution personnel are the primary resource responsible for preserving equipment
reliability. Decentralized crews are generally focused on preventive maintenance inspections, general
repairs, and operational activities. Centralized crews travel project-wide to support the decentralized

3

crews. Centralized support crews are staffed and equipped to perform heavy overhaul and specialty
trades work that is outside the normal workload of the employees assigned to the decentralized crew.
Field Maintenance
Working cooperatively with the Maintenance and Reliability Group, the Field Maintenance Group also
protects and preserves the integrity and capacity of CAP’s water delivery system and infrastructure. The
Field Maintenance Group is primarily composed of decentralized crews that are generally focused on
preventive maintenance inspections, general repairs, and operational activities. The Field Maintenance
Group also includes CAP’s Electrical Safety Program.
Field Maintenance crews are organized to work on both the west and south area of the CAP water delivery
system. Both sets of crews are responsible for maintaining the integrity, capacity and reliability of
pumping plants, aqueducts, check and turnout structures, recharge facilities, pipelines, siphons, tunnels,
operations and maintenance roads, cross-drainage structures, fencing, protective dikes, and other related
facilities. CAP’s electrical safety program manages CAP’s hazardous energy control and electrical safety to
ensure the safety of CAP personnel working in hazardous field locations.
Public Affairs
The mission of Public Affairs is to strategically advance CAP’s mission by developing a consistent and
unified voice and by building collaborative relationships internally and externally. There are four
departments within Public Affairs that work to achieve that goal: Board Relations, Communications,
Legislative Affairs and Stakeholder Relations.
Board Relations works directly with the Board, increasing opportunities for interaction with stakeholders
and peers and equipping them to effectively represent CAP and its positions. Communications creates
consistent messaging for various audiences, develops and deploys a consistent employee communications
plan, enhances public awareness for target audiences and improves knowledge and visibility of CAP. This
is done by providing information, perspectives, and programs that help influence public opinion and
enhance CAP’s reputation as a strategic partner in the management, delivery and protection of Colorado
River water. Legislative Affairs directs development and implementation of CAP's state and federal
legislative agendas, oversees and coordinates state and federal contract lobbyists and manages
communications with legislators, legislative staff, lobbyists and other water interests on legislative
matters of interest to CAP. Stakeholder Relations regularly meets with customers and stakeholders,
developing new relationships and strengthening existing ones to improve overall relationships.
Technology
The Technology Group is responsible for developing and maintaining highly effective, reliable, and secure
technology systems to support CAP’s mission.
Information Technology works with CAP employees to improve business practices through the use of
technology by providing technical support, business tools, and services. Information Technology
maintains application and systems infrastructure and provides technology project management. The
Information Technology department automates business processes where possible, thereby reducing
manual operations and enabling efficient workflow.
The Operational Technology department is responsible for the operations and maintenance of the
hardware and software systems that monitor and control physical assets. Operational Technology
executes engineered maintenance plans for physical assets associated with security, fire,
communications, HVAC, and power.
Legal Services
The Legal Services group serves as a legal support function to CAP, including and not limited to providing
legal advice to CAP’s departments and Board of Directors, negotiating/drafting/reviewing contracts,
4

managing litigation, and providing legal review of policies. Legal Services also assures compliance with
laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to CAP.
Finance and Administration
Finance and Administration is responsible for managing financial and administrative activities of CAP,
including finance and accounting, enterprise risk, records, resiliency, supply chain, and facilities services.
Finance and Administration ensures the accuracy and integrity of financial reporting, including planning,
rates, budget, and reserves as well as compliance with records management standards, purchasing policy
and oversight of insurance operations.
CAP’s Enterprise Risk, Records and Resiliency Management is responsible for alternative and traditional
risk transfer and financing, loss prevention, and claims management, better enabling CAP to meet its
strategic objectives. Records focuses on regulatory compliance of records and information, providing the
right records at the right time, and creating and maintaining a pipeline for good information flow.
Resiliency maintains preparedness for business disasters and threats to CAP’s operations, and regularly
tests for readiness and continuity of operations.
The Finance and Accounting department provides oversight and accountability in regard to CAP’s finances.
Financial Planning and Analysis is responsible for financial analysis and reporting, oversight of budget
development and forecasting, long-range financial planning, cash and treasury management, accounts
receivable and accountable property, and strategic reserve planning. Accounting responsibilities include
statement reporting according to generally accepted accounting principles, annual financial audits, and
matters related to accounts receivable and payable, and payroll.
The Supply Chain and Facilities departments within Finance and Administration address the procurement
of goods and services, inventory control, distribution of materials/supplies/equipment to other CAP
departments and locations, as well as providing facilities services.
Employee Services
The Employee Services Group provides strategic support and services necessary for CAP to maintain a
productive, safe, healthy and secure environment with competitive pay and benefits that encourages
employees to work at their optimum level. Employee Services enhances the effectiveness of CAP
employees by increasing their knowledge, skills, and abilities though continued learning, growth and
development opportunities. The Employee Services Group thus enables CAP to remain an employer of
choice that can recruit and retain highly qualified workers.
Central Learning and Development manages, designs, and implements CAP’s learning strategy, which
includes training, organizational development, and employee engagement programs. These programs and
processes ensure that CAP has skilled talent available to meet current and future business needs.
Human Resources strives to maintain CAP as a desirable workplace environment and capable organization
by recruiting and hiring highly qualified employees, providing good customer service to all employees, and
enhancing organizational performance through employee training, career development guidance, and
succession planning. Human Resources also oversees general issues related to staffing, compensation,
benefits, performance management, and employee relations and policies.
Protective Services is responsible for protecting CAP’s employees, facilities, the canal, surrounding
property, the environment and wildlife in order to keep Colorado River water flowing to CAP’s customers.
The mission of Protective Services is to provide CAP with a safe and secure work environment.
The Environmental Department leads CAP in being a good steward of the environment, and collaborates
with all departments to minimize CAP’s negative impacts on the environment. The Safety Program
supports health and safety in both the workplace and at home. The team of safety and health
professionals partner with CAP managers and employees to uphold the highest safety standards resulting
in an accident and injury free workplace.

CAP’s Climate Change and Adaptation Activities

CAP staff in the Colorado River Programs department routinely keep track of seasonal changes to climate
indicator signals such as sea surface temperature, ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation), and PDO (Pacific
Decadal Oscillation) to predict potential impacts to winter precipitation in the Upper Colorado River Basin.
In addition, there have been previous studies and current work efforts that CAP has been involved in that
incorporate the potential impacts of climate change. These activities include:
•

Modeling Colorado River water supply and use through the Colorado River Simulation System
(CRSS)2. Input into the CRSS model includes several water supply hydrologies, one of which is
derived from downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) projections and is referred to as the
Downscaled Climate hydrology (see Section 1.3.1 for more information on General Circulation
Models and downscaled hydrology).

•

Exploring dynamic downscaling using data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
(CMIP) as a method to improve climate GCMs in their ability to simulate precipitation. As part of
the project steering committee, CAP oversaw and provided input into the project that was
conducted by the University of Arizona using the Colorado River Basin as a test watershed to
gauge the success of the methodology.
Attempting to improve mid to near term prediction of streamflow in the Upper Colorado River
Basin by connecting sea surface temperatures to winter storms in the Upper Basin using synoptic
storm patterns. This is achieved by analyzing the predictability in the Winter Jet Stream position
over the Upper Colorado Basin based on Sea Surface Temperature. CAP solely funded this project
that was produced by the Desert Research Institute (DRI).
Exploring the sensitivity and correlation of hydrological variables (e.g. precipitation, snow water
equivalent, and streamflow) in the Upper Colorado River Basin to Lake Powell inflow and storage
from a historical perspective. This CAP-funded study that is being generated by DRI is attempting
to extrapolate definitive trends from the historical record that can help inform future and current
hydrological conditions in the Colorado River Basin.
Participating in the Water Utility Climate Alliance (WUCA). WUCA is composed of 12 water
agencies (Austin Water, CAP, Denver Water, MWD, NYCDEP, Philadelphia Water Department,
Portland Water Bureau, San Diego CWA, San Francisco PUC, Seattle Public Utilities, SNWA, and
Tampa Bay Water) that are collaboratively assessing the challenges water utilities face in adapting
to climate change. WUCA also provides an avenue to engage climate scientists on how to enhance
the usefulness of climate science and tools for climate adaptation by water utilities. CAP currently
serves as the Vice Chair for WUCA.

Climate Change and Projected Effects on CAP

This section provides a very brief introduction to climate change and a full description of the primary
impacts of climate change on CAP. More detailed summaries on the science of climate change, methods
used to project climate change and effects on hydrology, climate projections in the Colorado River Basin
(CAP water supply) and Arizona (CAP service area), and references to climate change assessments,
globally, regionally, and locally, is presented in Appendix A.

Bureau of Reclamation. CRSS incorporates important aspects of the Colorado River Basin; including reservoirs, flows, diversions, and operating
rules.

Climate change is the change to the Earth’s surface and air temperatures, atmospheric compositions, and
radiation absorption that occur over time periods longer than several decades. Climate change is driven
by both natural factors (Earth’s orbital patterns, solar radiation changes, plate tectonics, ocean circulation
and heat redistribution, cloud cover, chemical composition of the atmosphere) and factors influenced by
human activities (chemical composition of the atmosphere)3.
Climate change can be observed through examining data on surface temperature, global sea level,
precipitation, and global ice. Since direct measurements of these characteristics only go back to around
the 19th century, indirect methods such as tree-ring analysis (dendroclimatology) and ice cores are used
to estimate historical climate conditions.

1.3.1

Primary Climate Change Concerns for Central Arizona Project

The Colorado River Basin generates CAP’s water supply, so warmer and drier conditions caused by
prolonged climate change-induced drought in the watershed, with reduced snowpack and streamflow, is
a major challenge that requires active management. Increased warming in the CAP service area also
results in inflated water demand from customers, and extreme weather events such as flooding negatively
impact CAP’s water infrastructure.
Drought in the Upper Colorado River Basin
Prolonged drought conditions in the Colorado River Basin can impact the annual water supply available
for water users in the basin. Reliability of Colorado River water supply is strongly influenced by hydrologic
conditions in the Upper Colorado River Basin, since 92 percent of annual Colorado River flow is generated
there. As such, annual Colorado River flow is dependent on winter precipitation, snowpack accumulation,
and spring runoff that occurs in the Upper Basin.
Snowpack accumulation season for the Colorado River Basin occurs between October and April, when
winter storms produce precipitation that is then retained by the snowpack due to cooler temperatures.
Drier and hotter conditions due to drought may reduce the accumulation of snow during the winter
season due to fewer precipitation events and increased sublimation and melting of the existing snowpack.
In addition, excessively warm winter temperatures coupled with winter precipitation may cause rain
instead of snow to fall on the snowpack. This has the effect of reducing the size of the winter snowpack.
The spring runoff season takes place between the months of April and July, where snow accumulation
shifts to snow melt. The volume of runoff generated in this period is critical in determining inflow into
Lake Powell and subsequently the active storage of the Colorado River system.
Water stored in Lake Powell and Lake Mead constitutes the large majority of system storage in the
Colorado River Basin. The elevation and volume of the water stored in Lake Powell and Lake Mead factor
into how much water is delivered to downstream users in the Lower Colorado River Basin. Per the 2007
Interim Guidelines4, August projections5 of reservoir conditions in January of the following year influence

3 While “climate change” refers to any change in Earth’s surface and air temperatures, the term “global warming” refers specifically to
anthropogenic heating linked to the levels of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere.
4 The Record of Decision on the Colorado River Interim Guidelines for Lower Basin Shortages and the Coordinated Operations for Lake Powell
and Lake Mead (2007 Interim Guidelines) was signed in 2007. The 2007 Interim Guidelines define how Lakes Powell and Mead are operated in
coordination and was designed to manage the impacts of reduced water supplies to Lower Basin water users as Lake Mead declined in
elevation. One of the measures outlined in the 2007 Interim Guidelines is how a Lower Basin shortage affects Arizona and Nevada’s annual
Colorado River allocation.
5 These projections are published in the 24-month study. The 24-month study is a monthly report produced by the Bureau of Reclamation that
provides a 2-year future outlook from the present month for reservoir conditions in the Colorado River system. The reservoir conditions are
determined on a most probable inflow, based on the Colorado River Basin Forecast Center's most probable water supply forecast.

the volume of water released from Lake Powell downstream towards Lake Mead, and the volume of water
released from Lake Mead to satisfy water users in the Lower Basin.
According to the 2007 Interim Guidelines, if the August projections of January Lake Mead elevation is
below 1075 feet, then the Lower Basin will operate under shortage conditions for the subsequent calendar
year (starting on January). Under three progressive tiers of shortage, Arizona suffers a reduction to its 2.8
MAF annual allocation. At 1075 feet elevation in Lake Mead, Arizona’s Colorado River allocation drops to
2.48 MAF, at 1050 feet elevation it drops to 2.4 MAF, and at 1025 feet elevation it drops to 2.32 MAF.
Furthermore, entitlements for diverting Colorado River water in Arizona is organized under several orders
of priority6. CAP is a junior Colorado River priority holder in Arizona, and due to the nature of its Colorado
River entitlement7 will be expected to absorb reductions to Arizona’s Colorado River allocation due to
shortage. This reduction propagates down to CAP’s customers in central Arizona, which include cities,
farms, and Indian communities8.
Therefore, a primary effect of sustained drought due to climate change on the Colorado River Basin is
reductions to precipitation, snowpack accumulation, and snow melt. When these outcomes are coupled
with the operating framework of the Colorado River system (e.g. the 2007 Interim Guidelines) and
cascaded downstream, Arizona, and more specifically CAP, bears the largest brunt of vulnerability in terms
of cuts to its Colorado River water supply.
Increased Warming in the Lower Colorado River Basin
Rising regional temperatures associated with increased warming due to drought and climate change
produce several effects relevant to CAP and its operations. Higher temperatures in the southwest
translate to greater potential evaporation. For water stored in Lake Mead, this could mean an accelerated
timetable towards Lower Basin shortage and reductions to Arizona and CAP’s annual Colorado River
diversion. Higher evaporation rates can also impact the volume of CAP water stored in Lake Pleasant,
reducing CAP’s flexibility in utilizing that stored water to meet CAP customer demands in central Arizona.
Higher temperatures tend to cause water use to inflate, especially for agricultural customers and
particularly during the summer months. An inflation of water use for Colorado River water users in
Arizona, reduces the volume of Colorado River water that CAP can divert and deliver to its customers in
central Arizona. A similar effect can occur within CAP’s framework of customer priority, such that higher
priority users may utilize more CAP water, leaving less water available to lower priority contract holders.
In terms of CAP’s infrastructure, an increase of monthly temperatures (but primarily over the already high
temperatures of Arizona’s summer months) can accelerate the degradation and lifespan of CAP’s physical
assets (e.g. CAP canal, pumping plants, and mechanical parts). Higher temperatures may also encourage
algae growth and proliferation of aquatic nuisance species in the waters of the CAP canal, necessitating
an increase in maintenance activities. In addition to the physical operations that experience high
6 Arizona has six Colorado River priorities. Priority 1 (P1) are defined as present and perfected rights. Priorities 2 and 3 (P2/P3) are co-equal and
reflect contracts that are dated/executed on or prior to September 30, 1968. Priority 4 (P4); which includes CAP, are identified as contracts
dated/executed after September 30, 1968. Priorities 5 and 6 (P5/P6) are for unused water and surplus water, respectively. P5/P6 entitlements
can only be used if there is Colorado River water within Arizona’s allocation that is unused by P1 through P4. Water for P5/P6 water users is
rarely if ever available due to CAP’s entitlement.
7 CAP’s Colorado River entitlement allows it to divert from the Colorado River any water that is unused by all other higher priority water users
in Arizona (P1 to P4); such that Arizona’s annual consumptive use (of all P1 to P4 users and CAP) will equal its state allocation of 2.8 MAF.
8 CAP’s customers are organized into several priority pools; some of which are long-term contracts and some which are for excess use. The
highest priority belongs to on-river P3 water that is delivered to central Arizona customers through the CAP canal. The next priority pool is for
Indian and M&I (municipal and industrial) contracts. The next priority pool is was originally designated for Non-Indian Agriculture (NIA), but has
since been used to meet the demands of Indian and M&I customers. Beyond these priorities are the excess pools which include the agricultural
pool and the other excess pool; which provides water to the Central Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District and the Arizona Water
Banking Authority.

vulnerability due to increased warming, extreme temperatures also generate health risks and dangers to
CAP’s workforce, especially to CAP employees that work in the field and are exposed to these conditions
on a daily basis.
Finally, a potential cost component that is driven by increased temperatures relates to power costs during
peak temperature periods. As the largest consumer of energy in Arizona9, the CAP system may endure
higher energy costs during the summer months due to inflated costs associated with the peak energy
demand portion of the year. Since CAP’s operations generally cannot be scaled back to mitigate higher
energy costs in the summer, CAP will have to factor for these power costs in the summer (May –
September) when water and energy demand are both high.
Extreme Weather Events in the CAP Service Area
The primary concern for CAP when it comes to extreme weather events is directly related to the durability
of its infrastructure and the safety of its employees. Central Arizona continues to experience extreme
weather events such as haboobs (dust storms), heavy thunderstorms, flash flooding, and high winds with
some periodic regularity. All of these types of extreme events can stress CAP’s existing infrastructure,
shortening the lifespan of physical assets and increasing the risk of failures in the system. When coupled
with accelerated degradation of infrastructure due to warming, extreme events can cause significant
damage to CAP infrastructure and require higher and more frequent levels of maintenance. The frequency
and intensity of these extreme weather events also poses a safety risk to CAP employees, particularly for
those that primarily work out in the field.

2.0 Approach
The impact of climate change on CAP is dependent on future conditions, which are by definition uncertain.
To help shape policies that will ensure the resiliency of CAP and its ability to achieve its mission, a scenario
planning approach was developed which considers a range of future conditions. Considering a range of
future conditions allows CAP to be prepared for a variety of circumstances, mitigating uncertainty. This
section describes the scenario planning approach in two parts: general approaches and specific
approaches applied in development of this plan.

2.1

General Scenario Planning Approach

Scenario planning is a method of planning for an uncertain future by developing plausible future
conditions, assessing gaps, and evaluating actions that may be necessary. Typically, a few sets of future
conditions, or “scenarios,” are defined. Scenarios are not intended to predict the future, rather they are
intended to bracket a plausible range of future conditions.
Formal scenario planning or development is a step-wise process that typically involves several phases
presented in Figure 1 and described as follows:
•

Scenario definition. The first step in scenario planning is to define a focus issue, or the question
that is driving the effort. Then, key drivers of change that capture the concerns of the focus issue
are identified. Drivers are typically external to, and therefore beyond the control of, the entity
performing scenario planning.

•

Scenario construction. Based on the key drivers identified, scenarios are developed that capture
a range of plausible future conditions. Future conditions, as relevant to the focal question, are
further defined and may be quantified.

9 CAP uses more than 2.8 billion kilowatt hours of energy per year to deliver more than 500 billion gallons of Colorado River water to 80
percent of Arizona’s population.

9

•

Scenario analysis. Consequences of interactions amongst drivers are explored, and trends are
identified. Some analysis of uncertainty may also be performed.

•

Scenario assessment. Key challenges and opportunities associated with each scenario, as related
to the focus issue, are defined. In addition, potential management strategies are developed to
address challenges and take advantage of opportunities.

•

Risk management. Strategies are selectively implemented to reduce vulnerabilities and risk, and
to increase resiliency.

•

Monitoring and post-scenario development audits. Because the environment is always changing,
scenarios are reviewed and plans are modified accordingly.

2.2

Approach Used for the CAP Climate Adaptation Plan

The scenario planning process used for this study is a condensed version of the process described in
Section 2.1. The process was centered around workshops attended by subject matter experts from within
CAP. A summary of the process, described in the context of workshops, is as follows:
•

Develop focal questions and assemble the team. Prior to the workshops, the focal questions
were developed, and CAP experts were selected to participate in the workshops. To select the
team, CAP’s functions that are sensitive to climate change and that would likely be involved in
adaptation efforts were identified. Functions represent key areas of the organization that carry
out actions in support of CAP’s mission. Functions may include specific departments, pairs of
10

departments, or entire groups that were described in CAP’s organizational structure (Section
1.1.2). Experts were selected from CAP’s functions that were identified as having the greatest
sensitivity to climate change impacts and potential adaptation efforts. Functions are listed below
these bullets.
•

Develop drivers and scenarios. The team identified potential drivers, or forces external to CAP
that impact CAP operations or future conditions. The drivers were condensed into a set of “key
drivers” that were deemed to have the most potential impact and whose outcomes were the most
uncertain. Three scenarios were then developed, defined by a specific “state” of each key driver,
representing plausible future conditions.

•

Develop implications. For each scenario, the team identified potential implications to CAP across
all CAP climate-sensitive functions. Implications are the potential effects of climate change on
CAP.

•

Develop adaptation strategies. For each scenario, the team identified potential specific actions
that could be taken to adapt to each implication of climate change.

•

Develop robust solutions. The team selected preferred adaptation strategies that could be
implemented, in three categories:
o

“No regrets” strategies are those that provide a benefit with no or minimal downside of
implementing, even if the future envisioned does not come to pass.

o

“Low regrets” strategies are those that are generally easy to implement, but the benefit
to the organization is greater when the future envisioned does come to pass. Additionally,
low regrets actions can preserve an opportunity for future implementation.

o

“Conditional” strategies are those that could be implemented in the future, under specific
conditions.

Each step is discussed in more detail in its respective section below.
Key to development of this plan was active participation of the team, representing CAP’s climate-sensitive
functions. All drivers, implications, strategies, and robust solutions were developed by the team, in a
collaborative fashion. In all workshops, the team was split into three to four groups for brainstorming
sessions. The result was that the components of the CAP Climate Adaptation Plan were developed entirely
by experts from within CAP. The CAP functions represented are as follows:
•

Central Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District (CAGRD)

Colorado River Programs

Communications

3.0 Workshop Results: Drivers, Scenarios, Implications,
Adaptation Strategies, and Portfolios
This section summarizes the results of the planning workshops. The focal questions that CAP wants to
answer through the scenario planning process are “how resilient is CAP to climate change?” and “how do
we improve resiliency to climate change?” To answer these questions, CAP looked at how climate change
could potentially affect their operations and supply and developed strategies to adapt to those effects.

3.1

Drivers and Scenarios (Workshop 1)

In the first workshop, drivers were identified, and scenarios were developed based on the drivers. Drivers
are forces external to CAP, that impact CAP operations or future conditions. For this project, CAP is
focusing on drivers related to climate change. Primary drivers include the physical components of climate
change: temperature, precipitation, and streamflow. Secondary drivers flow from these and may affect
what CAP does more directly. For example, temperature change (primary driver) could cause reduced
population (secondary driver) in Phoenix, which could affect human resources by limiting the recruitment
pool.
A group of “key drivers” was selected from the larger list of drivers. Key drivers are the most important
and the most uncertain and may be either primary or secondary drivers. The team then “bracketed” the
key drivers with a qualitative range of potential future conditions. The list of key drivers and their “low”
and “high” bracket conditions is presented in Table 1.
It should be noted that all drivers identified by the team can be described in terms of one or more key
drivers. For example, “biological changes in water quality” can be characterized by temperature (how
warm the water is) and Colorado River supply (how much water there is). It follows that all drivers
identified by the team are implicitly considered in the process. A complete listing of all drivers and their
links to key drivers is presented in Appendix B.
Scenarios represent possible futures and are described by a defined “state” (high bracket or low bracket
in Table 1) for each of the key drivers. To facilitate a robust adaptation plan, it is useful to define several
plausible scenarios that together capture a range of potential future conditions. For this study, three
scenarios were developed that capture a range of plausible futures (Table 2). Key elements of the
scenarios are as follows:
•

Scenario 1: Low water supply, high demand for water, with a strong economy.

•

Scenario 2: High water supply, low demand for water, with a weak economy.

•

Scenario 3: Low water supply, high demand for water, with a weak economy.

Scenarios 1 and 2 were selected as end-members of the plausible potential futures, respectively. Scenario
3 is similar to scenario 1, with additional challenges not found in the first two in the form of a weak
economy.

Climate Change Implications (Workshops 2-3)

Implications are the potential effects of the climate change scenarios on CAP. Implications may be
challenges, opportunities, or both. The team split into three groups, one per scenario, to develop potential
implications of each scenario. Each group then presented implications to the team for discussion. In some
cases, additional implications were added by the team during the discussion.
All potential implications were reviewed and finalized by the team. The effort included the following:
•

Removing items that are better described as tools or strategies, rather than implications.

•

Consolidating implications that were identified for multiple scenarios in workshop 2.

•

Finalizing drivers associated with each implication.

•

Identifying other scenarios to which each implication may apply, considering the drivers.

•

Identifying which CAP functions are affected by the implication.

The finalized list of implications, to be used in the developing of tools and strategies, is presented as Table
3. A summary of each scenario, based on both drivers and implications, is provided as follows:
Scenario 1 centers around a low supply on the Colorado River and high demand. Challenges result from
higher temperatures and lower Colorado River supply causing issues ranging from reduced deliveries to
low priority users and biological (i.e. algal) growth in water to increased health and safety issues for CAP
employees. Opportunities, stemming from a higher regional population, include a larger tax base for
capital improvements and increased technological advances to combat shortages and offset warmer
temperatures.
Scenario 2 focuses on a high supply on the Colorado River and low demand. Decreased regional population
means difficulty recruiting and maintaining staff along with decreased tax revenue for capital
improvements. Excess supply causes the need for new recharge locations while bolstering state-wide
groundwater storage. A flexible regulatory environment increases opportunities for collaboration with
other agencies and the ability to pursue regulatory changes that benefit CAP.
Like scenario 1, scenario 3 centers on low Colorado River supply and high demand. Extreme weather in
scenario 3 presents challenges in the form of infrastructure issues (such as canal resiliency and risk
insurance) and a change in seasonal supply and demand patterns. Low population growth limits CAP’s
ability to recruit and maintain talent. However, this scenario presents opportunities for more
collaboration and technological advances, such as desalination, among lower basin states and increased
water conservation.

Climate Change Adaptation Strategies (Workshop 4)

Adaptation strategies are specific actions that can be taken to adapt to climate change. The team split
into three groups to develop potential adaptation strategies, for the list of implications by scenario. The
meeting was split into three sessions, allowing each group to identify potential adaptation strategies for
a subset of the implications in each scenario. The groups generally picked up where the previous group
left off, such that all implications were evaluated. In some cases, multiple groups identified potential
strategies for the same implication.
For each adaptation strategy, the groups identified the “ease of implementation,” defined as easy (E),
moderate (M), or difficult (D), as well as a listing of all implications in the scenario to which the adaptation
strategy could apply.
Overlapping strategies were then consolidated and grouped by common themes. Table 4 presents a final
list of all strategies, what implications they address and in which scenarios they apply, which functions
would be involved in each strategy, and ease of implementation. Table 3 summarizes the number of
adaptation strategies that were identified for each implication, along with their ease of implementation.
Together, Table 3 and Table 4 were used in portfolio development to select portfolios composed of
strategies that address numerous implications, but also implications that present the biggest risk to CAP.
In addition to the adaptation strategies summarized in Table 4, the team also identified an additional
strategy that was applicable for almost any implication, regardless of the scenario. This strategy is
described as “Do Nothing”. The “Do Nothing” strategy in itself is not an adaptation strategy because it
requires no adaptive action. Rather this strategy implies that by doing nothing in the face of an implication,
CAP is willing to pay fines and penalties as needed, suffer the full consequences of a challenging
implication, or not capitalize on an opportunity. The “Do Nothing” strategy also recognizes that there may
be implications so dire or extreme that it may be more palatable for CAP to not invest resources to adapt
for them. Since doing nothing is not considered an adaptation strategy, it was excluded from Table 4.
However, in terms of portfolio development, the team considered the “Do Nothing” strategy (as evident
in Section 3.4).

Portfolios (Workshop 5)

A portfolio is defined as a collection of strategies. Portfolios are used to help understand how individual
strategies perform under different conditions. Some key considerations used by the team when selecting
strategies for a portfolio are as follows:
•

Does the strategy apply to multiple scenarios?

•

Is the strategy easy to implement?

•

Does the strategy address single or possibly many implications?

•

Consider the implications the strategy addresses. Does the strategy reduce CAP’s biggest
vulnerabilities and risks? Vulnerabilities are defined as implications with few strategies to address.
Risk can be assessed by considering vulnerability and the severity or criticality of the implications.

•

Does the strategy increase flexibility? That is, does it reduce or increase the ability to implement
other strategies in the future?

The team was split into three groups. Each group was charged with developing a portfolio of 10 strategies,
and to assign one of the following categories to each strategy:
1. No Regrets strategies are easy to implement, and provide a net benefit whether or not the specific
implication it targets comes to pass. No regrets strategies are those that CAP would generally
adopt, and are very likely to adopt in the near-term; for example: mandatory safety equipment
for all employees. As such, there is no risk of overinvestment with No Regrets strategies. These
types of strategies provide no detriment to the organization, even if the implications they are
meant to address do not materialize.
2. Low Regrets strategies are generally easy to implement, and generally provide a net benefit
whether or not the specific implication it targets comes to pass. However, the benefit to the
organization is higher when the specific implication occurs. There is little risk for overinvestment
with Low Regrets strategies, but there could be significant risks if there is underinvestment in
these types of strategies. An example of a low regrets strategy is to increase water conservation
programs. While there is some cost to conservation programs, the risk of overinvestment is small.
3. Conditional strategies are those that would be implemented under very specific conditions. They
tend to be difficult to implement, and typically only provide a benefit for a particular implication.
If that implication does not transpire, the strategy should not be implemented. However, there
may be an associated “option to preserve” – in which some action would need to be taken in the
short term to “preserve” the ability to implement the conditional strategy should it be needed in
the future. Conditional strategies have a high risk of overinvestment and generally address large
scale and high-risk implications with extremely detrimental effects. An example of a Conditional
strategy is the construction of a desalination plant, which is a very costly and lengthy process to
provide water augmentation against severe drought conditions.
Each group was instructed to develop a portfolio that could be implemented across all scenarios. Groups
were instructed to utilize all three categories of strategies (no regrets/low regrets/conditional), but
additional direction on what makes a “good” portfolio was intentionally not provided.

3.4.1

Portfolios Developed

Portfolios developed by the team are presented in Table 5. Overall, there was a fair amount of overlap
amongst the three groups’ portfolios. Table 5 also highlights strategies that were selected across multiple
portfolios. While these are just the specific strategies selected, it was noted that given the significant
overlap amongst the strategies, there is more commonality amongst the groups’ portfolios than initially
apparent. For example, strategy #78 (“interagency collaboration/partnerships for power transmission
25

infrastructure”) is in substance similar to strategy #66 (“collaborate with others (public or private) to store
more water at Lake Pleasant or meet customer demands”); since both strategies implement collaboration
to address their respective implications. Likewise, strategy #112 (“public awareness campaign
communicating dangers of canal”), selected by group A, and strategy #4 (“communicate potential for
increased rates to customers”), selected by groups B and C utilize communication as a means to address
their respective implications.

4.0 Climate Adaptation Analysis
This section provides analysis of the key drivers, scenarios, implications, adaptation strategies, and
portfolios that were generated by the team as part of this climate adaptation process. In addition, the
impact of the implications and strategies on CAP’s organizational functions is explored.

4.1

Key Drivers

Key drivers were developed in Workshop 1 and are summarized in Table 1 as well as by implication in
Table 3. The drivers and their states (e.g. for population, states were low and high growth) that result in
the most challenge implications are Colorado River supply (frequent shortages) and demand changes (full
contract demand), while technology (rapid technological advances) and interagency
coordination/collaboration (collaborative) result in the most opportunity implications.
Table 6 summarizes the number of implications for each key driver and each key driver’s states, as well as
whether the implications are challenges, opportunities, or mixed. The key driver that resulted in the most
implications was Colorado River supply, specifically Colorado River supply with frequent and deep
shortages. Out of the 22 implications that are primarily attributed to Colorado River supply, 18 of those
implications are due to frequent deep shortages. Conversely, historical local precipitation and strong
economic growth were not primary key driver states for any of the implications.
Frequent deep shortages in Colorado River supply generated the highest number of challenge
implications, with full contract demand generating the next greatest number of challenges. Technology
and interagency coordination/collaboration generate few challenges regardless of their state (though
they do provide opportunities).
In general, there were fewer opportunities identified by the team. Rapid technological advances with
mainstreaming and a higher capacity of utilization is associated with the largest number of opportunity
implications. Furthermore, all the implications that are primarily influenced by rapid technological
advances are opportunities; no challenges are associated with this key driver state.
Mixed challenge/opportunity implications are unique implications that simultaneously provide a
challenge for CAP to adapt to and an opportunity that CAP can seize. While there are only a handful of
this type of implication generated by the team (see Table 3), most of the key driver states generate a
mixed challenge/opportunity implication.

Scenarios

The scenarios are described in section 3.1 and are analyzed herein as to the relative risk each poses. The
analysis is based on driver states discussed in the preceding sections, as well as the number of challenges
that were identified in each scenario. Scenario 3 has the most relative risk, followed closely by Scenario
1, with Scenario 2 having notably less relative risk.
The three scenarios explore various combinations of key drivers’ states (as summarized in Table 2). Table
7 shows the state that generates the greatest number of challenging implications (see Table 6) by driver
for each scenario, and whether a given driver state was included in each scenario (check marks).
Furthermore, the relative difference in number of challenges faced in alternate driver states is also shown.
This table provides a qualitative indication of which scenarios present the most risk10 for CAP, in terms of
the number of most challenging driver states and associated challenges. Key conclusions are that Scenario
3 likely presents the most risk, and that risk is driven by low supply, high demand, increased precipitation
events, and a restrictive regulatory environment.
Table 7: Occurrence of key driver states that generate the most challenges per scenario

Scenario 3 was comprised of eight of the nine most challenging key driver states, followed by Scenario 1
(which had six of the nine most challenging key driver states). Scenario 2 had the least number of most
challenging key driver states (four of the nine). Several of these key driver states were present in more
than one of the three scenarios, with the exception of significantly warmer temperature, which only
occurred in Scenario 1.
Figure 2 illustrates the number of challenge, opportunity, and mixed challenge/opportunity implications
per scenario. Generally, all scenarios have approximately the same number of opportunity and mixed
challenge/opportunity implications. However, both Scenario 1 and 3 have more than double the number
of challenge implications than Scenario 2.

10 Risk is based on severity of outcome and difficulty in mitigating that outcome. Risk was not explicitly assessed during this effort but is
recommended for future assessment. Because risk was not assessed, the number of challenges is used as a proxy for risk. However, this is a
qualitative assessment because challenges may differ in level of severity.
30

Figure 2: Number of implications per scenario

4.3

Implications

This section summarizes the implications generated with focus on two characteristics of the implications:
1) likelihood of implication occurring, and 2) ability to mitigate the implication. Together with severity of
implications (see Section 6.0 Next Steps), these characteristics can be used to inform potential risk to CAP.

4.3.1

Occurrence of Implications Across Scenarios and Driver States

Table 8 lists the five implications that are present in all three scenarios. These implications represent
issues that CAP either currently manages or will very likely need to address in the near future. The majority
of these implications are driven by temperature conditions; all scenarios describe a warmer future (with
Scenarios 1 and 3 being significantly warmer than Scenario 2). Both biological incursions impacting the
canal system, and health/safety issues and accidents are outcomes directly associated with higher
temperatures. Managing seasonal demand from customers is also related to increase in temperature (i.e.
lengthening the “summer” season). Increased maintenance efficiency is an implication that is primarily
attributed to technology. This opportunity presents itself regardless of the level of technological capacity
available to CAP (status quo or more utilization). The use of technology inherently helps make
maintenance more efficient and enables the completion of maintenance requirements more consistently.
The last implication that is common to all scenarios is the ongoing need to manage perceptions about CAP
and its public image. The need to maintain a positive CAP image to the public is an implication that must
be considered both in the present and in the future, as it affects the organization’s reputation and its
ability to do business with its customers and partners.

Mixed Implications

curve.

#41. Increased health and safety

#54. Ongoing need to manage

Another way to assess the risk/reward that a particular scenario may pose to CAP is to examine
implications that are unique to each scenario. Scenario 1 had eight unique implications that were driven
by several of the key driver states that were exclusively present in Scenario 1: high population growth,
competitive interagency collaboration, and rapid technological advances (see Table 9).
Challenge implications unique to Scenario 1 were:
•

Increased O&M on equipment (pumps, etc.) and facilities (implication #25). Increased O&M arises
because of hotter temperatures.

•

Increased difficulty seeking legislative/regulatory solutions without partners (implication #44).
Since CAP is operating in a combative environment in this scenario, it is harder to find solutions
in an already restrictive regulatory/legal/policy setting.

•

Increasing encroachment on CAP lands (implication #48). Encroachment issues arise in this
scenario due to high population growth that causes urban/rural development (spurred by strong
economic growth) to move closer to the CAP canal and infrastructure.

Opportunity implications unique to Scenario 1 were:
•

Increased tax base (implication #19). An increased tax base is available in this scenario due to high
population growth. This results in more funding available for capital improvements and other
water reliability projects.

•

Increased power supplies / reduced power cost (implication #20). With rapid technological
growth, power may become less expensive.

•

Increased operational efficiency (implication #38). More efficient operations for the CAP system
is possible due to technology improvements, e.g. better methods to cool equipment and offset
the effects of warmer temperatures.

•

Increased non-traditional public/private partnerships (implication #58). With interagency
collaboration being difficult, CAP may look to collaborate with partners it has not traditionally
worked with to achieve its goals and objectives.

•

Larger talent pool (implication #60). A byproduct of having high population growth in this scenario
is that a larger population can provide more qualified candidates to recruit to CAP.

Much like Scenario 1, the eight implications that were unique to Scenario 2 (see Table 10) were mostly
driven by key driver states that were exclusive to Scenario 2. The key driver states that were exclusively
present in Scenario 2 include a normal CAP supply, low contract demand, and a flexible
regulatory/legal/policy framework. Historical precipitation was also a key driver state that was only
present in Scenario 2 but, as Table 6 confirms, historical precipitation did not primarily influence any of
the implications that were generated.

33

Challenge implications unique to Scenario 2 were:
•

Increased cost to customers – demand driven (implication #3). Having a low water demand from
CAP long-term contract water users, coupled with low population growth and a weak economy,
decreases the ability of customers to pay increased water rates.

•

Pressure to defer capital projects and technological advances (implication #8). Even with a normal
CAP supply, a weak economy and low water demand translates to reduced revenue generation
from water sales, thus only high priority projects are slated for implementation.

•

Difficulty projecting long-range rates (implication #12). With flexible regulations, it is difficult to
anticipate the future regulatory environment thus affecting the ability to project long-range rates.

•

Increased O&M for recharge (implication #30). There are increased operation and maintenance
challenges with continued or increased recharge.

•

Continuous adjusting to regulatory environment (implication #53). There are legal and legislative
challenges related to adjusting to continuous regulatory changes in a lax regulatory environment.
Furthermore, these shifting regulatory changes can challenge CAP’s ability to meet its mission and
have negative effects on CAP.

Opportunity implications unique to Scenario 2 were:
•

Good supply for CAGRD (implication #18). With low demand obligations from long-term contract
CAP water users, there will be an abundant water supply available for the CAGRD.

•

Less urgency for short-term water policy planning, affording flexibility and proactive, not reactive,
response (implication #61). With a normal to high water supply and low water demand, there is
more time available for planning and collaboration without the pressure of executing short-term
planning solutions.

The only mixed challenge/opportunity implication unique to Scenario 2 was:
•

Physical challenges to storing excess water due to long-term groundwater level rise (implication
#16). There will be future challenges from regularly managing the storage of excess water
resulting from long-term low water demand and high water supply. There will also be a need for
new recharge locations due to long-term rising groundwater levels and the reduced ability to
recharge water in existing recharge locations.

Since all of the key driver states that comprise Scenario 3 exist in either Scenario 1 or 2, there are no
implications that are unique to Scenario 3.

4.3.2

Ability to Mitigate Implications

Another aspect of interest to examine is the ability to mitigate or adapt to a particular implication. The
number of adaptation strategies available as options to address a single implication can be used to
estimate the ability to mitigate or adapt to that implication11. The more strategies available per
implication, the greater planning flexibility CAP possesses in addressing that implication. This is especially
true if the suite of options available include strategies with varying levels of ease of implementation, thus
enabling CAP to explore easy strategies before considering more difficult ones.
The following are the top five implications that had the greatest number of strategies:
1. Increased cost to customers – demand driven (implication #3)
•

13 adaptation strategies

2. Reduced ability of customers to pay rates (implication #4)
•

11 adaptation strategies

3. Collaborative planning environment (implication #59)
•

11 adaptation strategies

4. Increased cost to customers – power driven (implication #2)
•

10 adaptation strategies

5. Employee recruitment challenges (implication #43)
•

10 adaptation strategies

Three of the top five implications that had the largest number of strategies associated with them deal
with challenges related to costs (due to demand and power changes) and the ability of CAP customers to
pay these costs. The other two implications focus on CAP operating in a collaborative planning
environment, and tackling hurdles related to recruiting new CAP employees. Being in a collaborative
planning environment is a broad implication that provides numerous opportunities (through adaptation
strategies). It adds flexibility for CAP to put into action planning projects and activities with a wide array
of willing partners, hence the large number of strategies available to implement in response. Employee
recruitment challenges can be mitigated by adopting different internal staffing or employment policies
that can attract and retain CAP employees through incentives such as improved work-life balance, better
benefits, and competitive compensation.
Just as implications with many strategies may be easy to adapt to, implications with few strategies may
be more difficult to adapt to. All implications that were generated by the team have at least two potential
strategies. Table 11 lists the eight implications that only have two strategies.
Six of the eight implications with only two available strategies are connected to water operations and
maintenance, and water supply planning. All of these six implications are also opportunities – with the
exception of increased operations and maintenance due to increased recharge. Additionally, most of
these implications are associated with a single scenario (excluding implications #37, 40, and 54), which
could be a factor in the lower number of strategies connected to them. Conversely, the ongoing need to
manage public perceptions (implication #54) is common to all scenarios (see Table 8).

11 Ability to mitigate would also depend on the ease of implementation of strategies, not solely the number of strategies, that address an
implication. Using the number of adaptation strategies is an approximation, and the approach could be refined in a subsequent phase of work.

4.4

Adaptation Strategies

This section summarizes strategies to mitigate the implications discussed in the previous section. It
focuses on three key characteristics of adaptation strategies, each discussed in subsections below: 1) ease
of implementation, 2) applicability of strategies across scenarios, and 3) effectiveness of strategy to
address multiple implications and/or key vulnerabilities to CAP. These characteristics can help prioritize
strategies and inform whether the strategies are no regrets, low regrets, or conditional.

4.4.1

Ease of Implementation of Strategies

Adaptation strategies were developed by the team in response to the implications that were generated.
Each adaptation strategy is an action meant to mitigate a challenge or capitalize on an opportunity.
Adaptation strategies were assigned an ease of implementation (easy/medium/difficult) that corresponds
with how easy or difficult it is to implement a strategy in a given scenario. Having a strategy that can be
implemented in more than one scenario also makes it possible for that strategy to have different levels of
ease of implementation in the different scenarios (e.g. a strategy can be easy to implement in one scenario
but difficult to implement in another scenario).
The number of strategies, and the strategies’ ease of implementation (easy/medium/difficult), per
scenario is summarized in Figure 3. The ease of implementation for a strategy is highly dependent on the
scenario, due to the combination of key driver states that constitute that scenario. Scenario 1 had the
highest number of easy to implement strategies, while Scenario 3 had the highest number of difficult to
implement strategies. Scenario 2 had the smallest number of potential strategies. Likewise, Scenario 2
also had the smallest number of total available implications.

Figure 3: Number of strategies per scenario
Figure 4 illustrates the distribution of the ease of implementation for all adaptation strategies. Easy to
medium strategies are strategies that are applicable in at least two scenarios, where the strategy is easy
to implement in one scenario and medium difficulty to implement in another scenario. Similarly, medium
to difficult strategies are strategies that are applicable in more than one scenario where the strategy is
medium to implement in one scenario and difficult to implement in another scenario. Easy to difficult
strategies are also applicable in more than one scenario where the ease of implementation ranges
between easy and difficult.
Figure 4 reveals that the majority of strategies are uniformly easy, medium, or difficult in the scenarios
they are applicable to – with uniformly easy to implement strategies being the most prevalent (42 percent
of all strategies). Strategies with varying levels of ease of implementation across multiple scenarios are
much fewer in number, only accounting for 20 percent of all strategies. In that subset of strategies with
varying levels of ease of implementation, there is only one strategy that can vary from easy to difficult
implementation across different scenarios: Interagency collaboration/partnerships for power
transmission infrastructure (strategy #78). Ease of implementation of strategy #78 is highly dependent on
the state of the key driver interagency collaboration. If interagency collaboration is competitive and
combative (Scenario 1), strategy #78 would be difficult to implement, whereas if interagency collaboration
is collaborative (Scenarios 2 and 3), strategy #78 would be easy to implement.

37

Figure 4: Distribution of adaptation strategies with different levels of ease of implementation

4.4.2

Applicability of Strategies Across Scenarios

Less than half of all the adaptation strategies (38 percent) are applicable to all three scenarios. Of these
50 strategies, 25 are easy to implement, seven are medium to implement, and six are difficult to
implement. Table 12 through Table 14 list the strategies that are uniformly either easy, medium, or
difficult to implement across all three scenarios, respectively.
Strategies that are uniformly easy to implement (Table 12) can be considered no regrets strategies
because they are both easy to implement and can be applicable to any scenario. A review of the strategies
in Table 12 suggests strategies that CAP is either currently implementing (such as banking water, creating
intentionally created surplus, and collaborating with others to address water supply/demand imbalance)
or can easily implement with little to no additional resources or staff time (such as increasing
communications on water quality, staff and board outreach, and prioritizing work activities). Sixteen of
the 25 strategies in Table 12 address opportunity and/or mixed implications.

#110. Increase
patrolling/surveillance.

other agencies to facilitate
permitting and environmental
compliance.
#121. Collaborate with others to
address water supply/demand
imbalance.

Strategies with uniformly medium level ease of implementation in all scenarios are listed in Table 13.
These seven strategies, mostly associated with issues of cost, are thematically similar in that they are preemptive measures. They are not direct responses to the implications they address, but are actions that
need to be put into place before an implication fully manifests. For example, early rate increases,
refinancing, interstate water sales, and alternative water in the canal are all strategies meant to minimize
large jumps in inevitable water rate increases (due to factors outside of CAP’s control such as inflation
affecting cost of business). Similarly, changing staff and resource distribution and responsibilities, as well
as working with difficult partners are not ideal actions to implement, but doing so mitigates a more drastic
action later (such as unrecoverable loss of resources and staff or prolonged conflict with difficult partners
that will cost more time and resources).

#58. Changing staffing resource

#120. Collaborate with difficult
partners.

39

Only six strategies are uniformly difficult to implement in all scenarios (see Table 14). That said, the range
of difficulty will vary by the specific action taken. For example, while finding other water supplies (through
water augmentation) may be a difficult task, generating new supplies through weather modification is
significantly easier to accomplish than water desalination. CAP is currently participating in weather
modification programs, while it takes on average 20 years to bring a desalination plant from concept to
operation. Similarly, the specific actions associated with decreasing CAP’s level of service may vary in
difficulty depending on what service is being decreased. Shifting CAP water operations and maintenance
to less than optimal levels of service is far more difficult and consequential than reducing the frequency
of CAP’s communication to the public and its customers (both are generally difficult from a strategy
standpoint, but one action is more difficult to undergo and apply).

#7. Lobby for ability to generate
power to offset power costs.

#8. Increase tax authority/increase
tax percentage.

#14. Pre-emptively increase
financial reserves.

#9. Find other supplies, e.g.

etc. (augmentation).

resources/equipment.

Analyzing strategies that are only applicable in a single scenario provides a measure of the adaptation
efforts that are exclusively required in that scenario. Only nine strategies could be exclusively applied to
Scenario 1 (see Table 15). These include beneficial financial strategies due to the presence of strong
economic growth, necessary increases in public partnerships to compensate for competitive interagency
collaboration, and staffing opportunities due to high population growth in central Arizona. There were no
difficult strategies that were exclusively applicable to Scenario 1.

There were 10 strategies that were exclusively applicable to Scenario 2 (see Table 16). These 10 strategies
cover topics such as alternative financial and water supply planning, groundwater storage and recharge,
and reduction in staffing and operation capacity. These 10 unique strategies respond to the combination

40

of the key driver states of a normal CAP supply, low water demand, low population growth, and weak
economic growth.
No strategies were exclusively applicable to Scenario 3. This is due to the fact that Scenario 3 also did
not have any unique implications associated with it.

4.4.3

Effectiveness of Strategies in Addressing Multiple Implications

The following are the top three strategies that individually address the largest number of implications:
1. Find other supplies, e.g. desalination, weather modification, etc. (augmentation) (strategy #9)
•

11 implications

2. Changing staffing resource distribution, functions, responsibilities, possibly mothball equipment
(strategy #58)
•

10 implications

3. Decrease level of service (strategy #3)
•

Nine implications

All of these strategies represent broad categories with various actions that can be implemented (e.g.
different supplies for strategy #9, assorted types of changes to staffing resources for strategy #58, and
various ways to decrease levels of service for strategy #3). This broad applicability also lends itself to
allowing these strategies to provide solutions to numerous and disparate implications. For example,
finding other water supplies (strategy #9) provides adaptive response to increasing cost issues due to a
reduction in available water supply to market, insufficient water supply to meet customer demands, and
sub-optimal operation of the CAP system due to not conveying adequate volumes of water. Strategy #58
(Changing staffing resource distribution, functions, and responsibilities) also broadly addresses distinct
implications, such as impacts to infrastructure, operations, and employees, all of which will require
individually designed actions. Similarly, decreasing CAP’s level of service (strategy #3) is an overall strategy
to deal with shortcomings in various implications, due to reduced financial and physical resources to meet
customer obligations and/or CAP’s mission.
In contrast, there are 64 strategies that target only one implication (49 percent of all strategies). Of these
64 strategies, 42 percent were easy, 28 percent were medium, and 16 percent were difficult to implement
in the scenarios they were applicable to. Table 17 focuses on a subset of these single implication strategies
by highlighting the strategies that were uniformly difficult to implement.
Difficult strategies that only target one implication can be considered conditional strategies because they
are only applicable when a particular implication or set of conditions arises and their implementation
difficulty can limit the frequency of their application. Fully automating equipment (strategy #90) and
41

increasing the system capacity of generating and storing power (strategy #76) both require huge financial
investment in physical assets and lengthy implementation timelines to complete. Similarly, pursuing
legislation and regulatory changes (strategies #62 and 81 respectively) will require persistent lobbying
efforts that will likely not yield results in the near-term. Other strategies in Table 17 reflect diverse strategy
applications on similar issues. For example, strategy #27 emphasizes firming more water supplies (through
recovery of stored groundwater) while strategy #36 focuses on developing groundwater facilities. Both
strategies tackle a different aspect of groundwater supplies, but both will require costly expenditures,
either to build groundwater recovery infrastructure (for strategy #27) or to add groundwater storage
facilities (for strategy #36). The contrast between strategies #13 and #119 is also stark. Increasing staff
(strategy #119) and reducing or reorganizing staff and their duties (strategy #13) require wholly disparate
actions to execute. However, both of these strategies will require extensive internal evaluations and
analysis to make recommendations on how and where to optimally increase or reduce/restructure staff,
making them time-intensive strategies.

Portfolios

Portfolios are a suite of adaptation strategies that provide diverse adaptation coverage for a wide number
of future implications. Table 5 summarized the three portfolios developed by Group A, B, and C (three
groups formed from the team), respectively. The intent of portfolio development was to filter available
strategies into a smaller subset in order to identify preferred strategies. Preferred strategies are defined
as strategies that were included in multiple portfolios.
This section presents analysis of the three portfolios developed by the team. First, portfolio composition
is presented and commonalities across the three portfolios are summarized and evaluated. Next, a
summary of which functions are involved with each portfolio is presented. Taken together, this
information can be used to help develop a plan of action for CAP to adapt to climate change.

4.5.1

Portfolio Content and Commonalities

Each group was instructed to identify 10 different strategies that could be implemented across the
scenarios. Each strategy was also assigned a category (no regrets/low regrets/conditional) that indicates
the risk to CAP of implementing each strategy in a given portfolio. Groups were instructed to utilize all
three categories of strategies, but additional direction on what makes a “good” portfolio was intentionally
not provided.
Figure 5 compares portfolios A, B, and C with respect to the composition of their strategy categorization
(no regrets/low regrets/conditional), the ease of implementation of their strategies
(easy/medium/difficult),
and
the
implication
types
that
their
strategies
address
(challenges/opportunities/mixed challenges-opportunities). Generally speaking, it appears that Group A
focused on selecting strategies that addressed the most implications, which came at the expense of more
difficult strategies and fewer no regrets strategies. Group C appears to have focused more on ease of
42

implementation and no regrets strategies, at the expense of addressing fewer implications. Group B
appears to have taken a more balanced approach.

Figure 5: Comparison of group portfolios A, B, and C
Table 18 presents strategies that were common to two or more of the three portfolios developed by the
team. Strategies identified in multiple portfolios can be considered preferred strategies as they were
independently selected by multiple groups. This section summarizes the common strategies and why they
were selected, and also discusses the categorization (no regrets, low regrets, or conditional) of each
common strategy.
Only one adaptation strategy was common to all three group portfolios:
•

Strategy #9: Find other supplies, e.g. desalination, weather modification, etc. (augmentation).
Strategy #9 was selected because 1) it addresses key implications that affect CAP’s mission of
delivering water, particularly implication #15: Limited diversions from Colorado River because
Lake Mead is low, 2) it addresses 11 implications, the most of any strategy, and 3) it addresses
implications that occur in all three scenarios.
o

Only Group A considered this strategy to be conditional; both groups B and C categorized
this strategy as low regrets. This difference in categorization may be due to the assorted
types of water augmentation options available under this strategy (e.g. weather
modification can be considered low regrets due to lower costs of operation versus
desalination which is associated with higher costs and longer timelines to implement).

Six adaptation strategies were common to two portfolios:

43

•

Strategy #5: Look at refinance options. Strategy #5 addresses six implications, is applicable in all
scenarios, and has medium ease of implementation.
o

•

Strategy #66: Collaborate with others (public or private) to store more water at Lake Pleasant or
meet customer demands. Strategy #66 addresses four implications, is applicable in all scenarios,
and is considered medium to difficult to implement depending on the scenario. It addresses key
implications that are critical to CAP’s mission, and capitalizes on two opportunities: implications
#58 and #59: increased non-traditional public/private partnerships and collaborative planning
environment.
o

•

This strategy was categorized as a no regrets strategy by groups B and C in their respective
portfolios. Communicating potential rate increases to customers is an easy to implement
strategy and one that CAP has already done in the past and will continue to do when
appropriate. There is generally no detriment in informing CAP customers of potential
increases in water rates – in fact, alerting customers of a likely rate increase in the near
future provides customers more time to prepare for that outcome.

Strategy #31: increase conservation programs. Strategy #31 addresses six implications, is difficult
to implement, and is applicable in Scenarios 1 and 3, in which there is low supply and high
demand.
o

•

There is a less pronounced difference in how strategy #66 is categorized between Group
B and C. For group portfolio B this is a low regrets strategy, but for Group C the same
strategy is considered no regrets. This is because storing more water in Lake Pleasant
and/or meeting customer demands is considered a beneficial strategy for CAP (making it
a low regrets strategy only if too little or too much water is stored In Lake Pleasant or not
enough water is utilized to meet customer demands).

Strategy #4: Communicate the potential for a rate increase to customers. Strategy #4 addresses
five implications, is easy to implement, and is applicable in all scenarios.
o

•

Group A considered this strategy to be no regrets; Group C considered it conditional. The
exploration of refinance options may be a no regrets strategy if the available options for
refinancing are only investigated and not adopted. However, looking at refinance options
for the specific purpose of implementing one of them could be deemed a conditional
strategy; resorting to refinancing CAP’s debt repayment obligation to address issues
associated with increased costs is a significant undertaking.

Strategy #31 was classified as low regrets by groups A and C. Increasing water
conservation programs is a somewhat pre-emptive strategy; conserving more water in
the present (and reducing Colorado River diversions, thereby minimizing lake level
reductions in Lake Mead) mitigates the impact of water reductions in the future (either
by delaying the onset of a shortage or diminishing the severity of a water shortage). There
is also little risk of overinvestment in this strategy; reasonably conserving more water can
help to mitigate the effects of future shortages. But underinvestment in water
conservation programs can yield earlier onsets of water shortage or deeper reductions to
CAP’s annual diversion from the Colorado River.

Strategy #57: upgrade, update, or modify equipment for new issues. Strategy #57 addresses two
implications, including one that is critical to CAP’s mission (implication #27, potential damage to
CAP infrastructure and facilities, from weather, which could preclude CAP from being able to
deliver water).
o

Strategy #57 was classified as low regrets by both groups A and B. It is continuously being
implemented at CAP to either keep equipment in good operating condition or to modify
44

equipment to meet the developing challenges that CAP has to manage. It is almost a no
regrets strategy; however, the strategy is medium to difficult to implement, suggesting
there is risk of overinvestment.
•

Strategy #58: changing staffing resource distribution, functions, responsibilities, possibly mothball
equipment. This strategy was selected because it addresses 10 implications (second most of any
strategy) and is applicable in all scenarios. Ease of implementation is medium.
o

Strategy #58 was categorized as a conditional strategy in group portfolios A and B. What
makes this strategy conditional is that it represents a comprehensive reorganization of
existing CAP functions, departments, staff, and equipment due to challenges such as
increased work activities with limited staff and/or resources. Mothballing equipment is
also an indication of reduced organizational capacity, either from a staffing or
infrastructure perspective. Additionally, not implementing this conditional strategy could
lead to detrimental outcomes (e.g. being unable to meet the demands of increased
operations, maintenance, facilities repairs, and/or canal security).

Portfolios and Functions

This section discusses which CAP functions are involved with implementing strategies in the portfolios,
and which functions’ implications are mitigated. The portfolios generally mitigate implications affecting
all CAP climate-sensitive functions, but not all functions are involved with implementing the portfolios’
strategies.
In terms of the number of CAP functions that are associated with the strategy composition of each
portfolio, portfolio B was the only portfolio that contained strategies that involved all CAP functions. This
is primarily due to the inclusion of the “do nothing” option which is applicable to all functions for any type
of implication. However, when the “do nothing” option is removed, five functions (Information
Technology; CAGRD; Environmental, Health and Safety; Protective Services; and Risk and Liability
Management) are not involved with portfolio B’s selected strategies. The strategies in portfolio C involve
all of the CAP functions in this report except six: Operational Technology; Information Technology; CAGRD;
Environmental, Health and Safety; Human Resources; and Protective Services. Portfolio A only excludes
four CAP functions from its strategies: Information Technology; Environmental, Health and Safety;
Protective Services; and Risk and Liability Management. However, the intent of portfolio development
was to identify preferred strategies, not a full suite of strategies that could be implemented. As such,
functions not involved with strategies selected in portfolios may be involved with a broader suite of
strategies to adapt to climate change.
When exploring the implications that the strategies in these three portfolios address and the functions
that are affected by these implications, the implications that are addressed by the portfolios affect all CAP

45

functions. The only exception was group portfolio C, which does not address implications that affect
Human Resources.

4.6

Organizational Functions

This section summarizes how CAP organizational functions could be affected by climate change and CAP’s
climate adaptation plan. It has three subsections: first, it summarizes the relative balance of each function
between being affected by climate change implications versus being involved with the selected adaptation
strategies; second, it summarizes how implications may affect multiple functions; lastly, it summarizes
how strategies may be implemented by functions, either individually or across multiple functions.
Summaries of how individual functions may be affected by climate change and CAP’s climate adaptation
plan can be found in Appendix C.

4.6.1

Functions Sensitivity to Climate Change and Responsiveness to Climate Change

A function’s sensitivity to climate change can be approximated by the number of implications affecting
that function. Figure 6 summarizes the number and type of implications affecting each CAP function.
Water Operations and Power Programs is the most sensitive (28 implications), with Maintenance being
affected by the second highest number of implications (25). On the other end of the spectrum, Protective
Services and Information Technology were the least sensitive in terms of total number of implications
(seven).
In terms of challenge implications, Water Operations and Power Programs and Maintenance were both
associated with the highest number of challenge implications (20) out of all CAP functions. Human
Resources was associated with the fewest challenge implications (five).
In terms of mixed challenge/opportunity implications, Resource Planning and Analysis had the most mixed
challenge/opportunity implications (four). Environmental, Health and Safety, Human Resources,
Engineering, Financial Planning and Analysis, Communications, and Protective Services were all affected
by the lowest number of mixed challenge-opportunity implications (one).
In terms of opportunity implications, Protective Services, Environmental, Health and Safety, Information
Technology, and Risk and Liability Management were the only four functions that did not have any
opportunity implications. Human Resources, Legal, and Financial Planning and Analysis were affected by
the lowest number of opportunity implications (two). CAGRD was associated with the highest number of
opportunity implications (six).

46

Figure 6: The number and types of implications affecting each CAP function
A function’s ability to respond to climate change can be approximated by the number of strategies that
function is involved with. Figure 7 shows the range of ability to respond across the functions. Public Affairs
is the most responsive (37 strategies), followed by Financial Planning and Analysis and Water Operations
and Power Programs (33 strategies each). At the other end of the spectrum, Protective Services is the least
responsive, with six strategies.
Beyond the number of total strategies, some functions may have an easier or more difficult time
implementing the strategies, as measured by the ease of implementation. Relative difficulty can be
assessed based on the average difficulty of the strategies, or based on the number of easy or difficult
strategies.
Based on average difficulty, Communications has strategies that are easiest to implement (88 percent are
easy), and Legal has strategies that are most difficult to implement (58 percent are difficult). Between
these, Risk and Liability Management has the greatest percentage, 43 percent, of medium strategies.
Based on magnitude, the following summarizes functions based on specific levels of ease of
implementation:
•

Easy strategies. Five functions share the lowest number of easy strategies (three): Protective
Services, Information Technology, Risk and Liability Management, Operational Technology, and
Legal. On the other hand, Public Affairs was associated with the highest number of easy strategies
(18), and the highest number of strategies overall (37).

47

•

Medium strategies. Financial Planning and Analysis was associated with the highest number of
medium strategies (11). Three functions, Information Technology, Operational Technology, and
Environmental, Health and Safety were not involved with any medium strategies.

•

Difficult strategies. Protective Services, Information Technology, Risk and Liability Management,
Environmental, Health and Safety, and Communications, were all involved with only one difficult
to implement strategy each. The highest number of difficult to implement strategies (11)
belonged to Legal.

•

Strategies with variable ease of implementation. Water Operations and Power Programs and
Public Affairs were the only functions involved in strategies across each possible level of ease of
implementation (easy, easy to medium, medium, medium to difficult, difficult, and easy to
difficult). Risk and Liability Management, Communications, and Colorado River Programs were
not connected to any strategies that varied across scenarios, their associated strategies were
either uniformly easy, medium, or difficult to implement.

Using a combination of specific implementation levels, Public Affairs-associated strategies appear to be
easiest to implement (highest combination of easy, easy to medium, and medium strategies – 25) and
Financial Planning and Analysis-associated strategies appear to be most difficult to implement (highest
combination of medium, medium to difficult, and difficult strategies – 24).

Figure 7: The number and types of strategies involving each CAP function
The relative balance between sensitivity to climate change and responsiveness to climate change can be
approximated using an “adaptation capacity score,” which is, for each function, the ratio of adaptation
48

strategies to implications. It is a contrasting measure of the number of strategies that a function is involved
in (responsiveness) to the number of implications that affect a function (sensitivity). Adaptation capacity
scores greater than one indicate that a function is involved in more strategies than the number of
implications that affect it. Otherwise, if a function is affected by more implications than strategies it is
involved in, then the adaptation capacity score will be less than one.
Five CAP functions had adaptation capacity scores with values less than one. Risk and Liability
Management yielded the lowest score value of all CAP functions (0.5), as it was affected by 14 implications
but was only involved in seven strategies. For functions with score values greater than one, Human
Resources had the highest score (3.5) and was significantly higher than other CAP functions (the closest
function being Financial Planning and Analysis with a score of 2.06). Human Resources was affected by
eight implications but was involved with 28 strategies. Financial Planning and Analysis and Public Affairs
have lower adaptation capacity scores (both about two) than Human Resources but have a similar
magnitude difference between number of strategies and implications as Human Resources does, as can
be seen by their distance above the red dashed line in Figure 8.

Figure 8: Adaptation capacity scores of each CAP function (ratio of strategies to implications)

4.6.2

Implications, Analyzed by Functions

This section summarizes implications in terms of functions. The purpose of this section is to understand
on an organizational level how climate implications affect the organization. The section first summarizes
how many functions are affected by individual implications, then focuses on implications that either affect
all of CAP’s climate-sensitive functions or single functions, and finally summarizes common groups of
functions that share common implications.
Of the 61 implications, a little over half affect three or fewer functions (Figure 9). Only 15 percent affect
single functions. Aside from one implication that affects all functions, the maximum number of functions
affected by an implication is nine.

49

Figure 9: Implications summarized by number of functions affected
There was only one implication that affects all 16 of CAP’s climate-sensitive functions: cutbacks to other
agencies resulting in need for CAP to do others’ work (implication #55). This was a mixed
challenge/opportunity implication driven by weak economic health and a collaborative state of
interagency coordination. These key driver conditions necessitate CAP to take on a larger role and
workload from fellow agencies because economic conditions prohibit these partner agencies from having
enough staff for them to adequately meet objectives shred with CAP. Having highly collaborative
relationships and coordination with CAP’s partners creates an environment where this work distribution
shift is possible. It is a mixed implication because it allows CAP to have more influence and voice in the
multi-party work it performs, but can burden its own staff with an amplified workload.
For implications that only affect one CAP function, Table 19 provides information on the functions they
affect and the implications’ respective type (challenge/opportunity/mixed). There are a total of nine
specific implications that individually are only relevant to one function. With the exception of CAGRD and
Human Resources (both of which have three implications that solely affect each of them), all other
functions in Table 19 have just one implication that specifically affects them. And although CAGRD and
Human Resources are affected by more of these single-function implications, the strategies necessary to
adapt to those implications may require the participation of more than one function or other functions
besides CAGRD and Human Resources. In addition to being single-function implications, three of these
implications (implications #12, #18, and #60) are also single-scenario implications, making them
exclusively germane to a single function and a scenario.

For implications affecting multiple functions, commonalities were evaluated. Table 20 summarizes the
number of implications that pairs of functions would be affected by. Table 20 suggests that there are
certain combinations of functions that may frequently be affected by the same implications. For example,
there are 18 implications that are associated with both Maintenance and Water Operations and Power
Programs, due to the mutual function emphasis on the CAP canal.

4.6.3

Adaptation Strategies, Analyzed by Functions

This section summarizes adaptation strategies in terms of functions. The purpose of this section is to
understand on an organizational level how climate adaptation would be implemented. The section first
summarizes how many functions are involved with individual strategies, then focuses on strategies that
either involve all CAP climate-sensitive functions or single functions, and finally summarizes common
“teams” of functions that could be organized to implement adaptation strategies.
Of the 131 strategies, over 40 percent are single-function strategies, over 70 percent are associated with
one or two functions, and only two strategies include more than five functions (Figure 10).
The two strategies that involve all 16 CAP functions described in this process are decrease level of service
(strategy #3) and prioritize work activities (strategy #99). Both of these strategies are broad enough to
involve all functions, as they directly relate to work performance. However, they both aim to achieve
converse results under the same pressure of challenges associated with staffing issues. Prioritizing work
activities (strategy #99) is an effort to optimize work performance by completing the most pertinent work
deliverables first, while still aiming to complete all necessary work tasks. As such it is considered an easy
strategy to implement because it entails shifting existing work activities into an approach that more
efficiently prioritizes the most important elements to meeting CAP’s mission. Decreasing CAP’s level of
service on the other hand is a strategy that reflects an inability to meet all work tasks due to the
overwhelming burden of having insufficient staff and an inflated workload. In this strategy, CAP accepts
the difficult decision to not operate at peak performance, from a staff and customer service perspective,
in order to fulfill its most basic and essential responsibilities. This is a difficult strategy to implement
because it requires scaling back aspects of operations, capital project development, and deliverables,
which also has negative consequences to CAP’s reputation and public image (both to customers and
potential employees).
52

Figure 10: Adaptation strategies summarized by number of functions involved
Regarding strategies that only require one CAP function to implement (single-function strategies), there
are 57 strategies that meet this criterion (which is 44 percent of all generated strategies). Only 10 of the
16 CAP functions identified in this process were connected to strategies that exclusively involved them
(see Figure 11). Human Resources was associated with the highest number of single-function strategies
overall, and had the highest number of single-function strategies with a medium level ease of
implementation. Both Human Resources and Water Operations and Power Programs had the highest
number of difficult single-function strategies. Water Operations and Power Programs also was associated
with the highest number of easy to implement single-function strategies. Engineering was involved with
only one single-function strategy. All of the single-function strategies that are associated with CAGRD and
Communications were easy to implement strategies.

53

Figure 11: Functions with single-function adaptation strategies
For the almost 60 percent of strategies that involve multiple functions, commonalities were evaluated.
Table 21 summarizes number of strategies that pairs of functions would implement together. Table 21
suggests that there are certain combinations of functions that may frequently be involved in
implementing strategies together. For example, there are 14 strategies that are associated with both Legal
and Public Affairs, suggesting these two functions could work closely together in climate adaptation. Table
21 also reveals potential multi-function teams, such as Resource Planning and Analysis, Colorado River
Programs, and CAGRD; each of these pair combinations has at least eight shared strategies. These
commonalities are fairly well correlated with the commonalities of implications (Table 20); that is, the
paired or multi-function teams would both be sharing implications as well as strategies to address those
implications.

5.0 Conclusions
This climate adaptation plan was developed by team members that represented CAP’s climate-sensitive
functions. While it was led and facilitated by a smaller group, all of the information came from team
members through a series of workshops. All team members were actively engaged and participated
throughout the process. In addition to resulting in a robust plan, the process allowed staff to get better
integrated and to learn about how the different functions work together as a whole to meet CAP’s mission.
Key conclusions reached through this process are as follows:
•

•

Drivers
o Relative influence of drivers was estimated based on the number of challenges or
opportunities associated with each driver state.
o Colorado River supply and demand changes are the two most influential drivers in terms
of challenges.
o Technology is the most influential driver in terms of opportunities.
o Two driver states result in no implications: strong economic growth and historical
precipitation.
Scenarios
o Scenarios 1 and 3 are the most challenging to CAP in terms of number of implications, in
large part due to low Colorado River supply and full CAP contract demand. Scenario 3 is
more challenging than Scenario 1 due to weak economic growth and less technological
advancement.

55

Scenario 2, which has normal CAP supply and low contract demand, has less than half as
many challenge implications as Scenario 1.
Implications
o Three key characteristics of implications can be used to inform potential risk to CAP: 1)
likelihood of implication occurring, 2) severity of implication, and 3) ability to mitigate the
implication:
 Implications that are present in all scenarios represent issues that CAP either
currently manages or will very likely need to address in the near future. Five of
this type of implication were identified, mostly related to increasing temperature.
 Severity of implications was evaluated qualitatively during portfolio
development, where conditional strategies were selected to address the “most
important” implications, or those implications that would preclude CAP’s mission
of delivering water. Importance or severity of implications could be examined
further in a subsequent phase of work.
 Ability to mitigate was evaluated based on number of strategies available to
address an implication, as well as the ease of implementation of those strategies.
Ease of implementation was evaluated qualitatively; costs and other
considerations could be quantified in a subsequent phase of work.
Strategies
o Three characteristics of adaptation strategies can help prioritize and inform whether the
strategies are no/low regrets or conditional: 1) ease of implementation, 2) applicability of
strategies across scenarios, and 3) effectiveness of strategy to address multiple
implications and/or key vulnerabilities to CAP.
o No regrets strategies are those that provide a benefit with no or minimal downside of
implementing, even if the future envisioned does not come to pass. Twenty five strategies
were identified that are easy to implement and are applicable in all scenarios,
characteristics that are common to “no regrets” strategies. CAP is currently implementing
many of these, such as banking water, creating intentionally created surplus, and
collaborating with others to address water supply/demand imbalance. Implementation
of the others should be considered in the near-term.
o Low regrets strategies are those that are generally easy to implement, but the benefit to
the organization is greater when the future envisioned does come to pass. An example
low regrets strategy identified by the team in portfolio development is strategy #31:
increase conservation programs. It has little risk of overinvestment, and is somewhat preemptive: conserving water in the present mitigates the impact of water reductions in the
future.
o Conditional: conditional strategies are those that are only needed under a specific set of
circumstances, and have a high risk of overinvestment. An example of a conditional
strategy identified by the team in portfolio development is strategy #58: changing staffing
resource distribution, functions, responsibilities, possibly mothball equipment.
Portfolios
o The team developed three portfolios of strategies, including no regrets, low regrets, and
conditional strategies. The team noted that some conditional strategies were selected to
address what the team viewed as the most important implications.
o Strategies selected by the groups can be considered preferred strategies, particularly
those that were selected by more than one group. One strategy was selected in all three
portfolios: strategy #9, Find other supplies, e.g. desalination, weather modification, etc.
o

(augmentation). Six additional strategies were common across two of the three
portfolios.
Functions
o Different functions have varying levels of sensitivity to climate change, as approximated
by the number of implications for each function. Water Operations and Power Programs
and Maintenance are the two most sensitive functions, while Protective Services and
Information Technology are the two least sensitive functions.
o Different functions have varying levels of responsiveness to climate change, as estimated
by the number of adaptation strategies for each function. Public Affairs is the most
responsive function, while Protective Services is the least responsive function.
o The relative balance between sensitivity to climate change and responsiveness to climate
change was approximated using an “adaptation capacity score,” which is, for each
function, the ratio of number of adaptation strategies to number of implications. All
functions are affected by climate change, but there is wide variation across functions in
adaptation capacity scores. That is, some will see the direct effects of climate change
more (more sensitive), and some will be more involved with implementing adaptation
strategies (more responsive). Risk and Liability Management has the lowest adaptation
capacity score (more implications than strategies), while Human Resources has the
highest adaptation capacity score (more strategies than implications).
o Most strategies (more than 70 percent) involve one or two functions; only two strategies
involve more than five functions.
o For strategies requiring multiple functions to implement, there are certain combinations
of functions that frequently share both implications and strategies. These combinations
could result in formation of multi-function teams (two to three functions) to implement
strategies.
o Planning for climate change, and funding of adaptation strategies, should be done at an
organizational level, because different functions are affected by climate change
differently. Implementing strategies, once identified and funded, would generally be
done either at the functional level or a multi-function team level.

6.0 Next Steps
Sixty-one potential implications of climate change are presented in this report, along with 131 adaptation
strategies. Additional in-depth analysis of implications and strategies is recommended to identify and
prioritize the most important adaptation strategies. The analysis could be used to support an
implementation plan that highlights what strategies should be implemented and how to implement them,
along with a plan for monitoring conditions to inform additional future action. Additional analysis and the
implementation plan are described in more detail below.
The analysis would be used to assess risk to CAP and form the basis of an implementation plan. Risk could
be quantified by assessing the likelihood of implications occurring, the severity of the implications, and
the ability to mitigate the implications. Costs and benefits of strategies could be assessed, using a triple
bottom line or other multi-criteria evaluation approach.
The implementation plan would be based on the refined analysis. The following is an example list of
actions that could be included in the plan:
•
•

Identify and implement no regrets strategies and select low regrets strategies.
Identify options to preserve based on important conditional strategies, develop conditions of
implementation, and implement as appropriate.
57

•

•

•

Develop a plan to identify procedures and processes for implementing strategies, including
identification of functions and teams of functions that will implement strategies and an approach
for identifying timing and sequencing of strategy implementation.
Develop key conditions to monitor, based on the most influential drivers, to support subsequent
plan updates. Monitoring is intended to support triggering of strategies, either through identifying
conditions that change strategies from conditional to low regrets or no regrets, or otherwise
supporting sequencing of strategy implementation.
Develop a plan for revisiting and updating the analysis (“continuous planning”). Generally, the
plan should be revisited frequently enough that if changing conditions result in the need to
implement a conditional strategy (that is, it becomes no regrets or low regrets), there is sufficient
time to implement that strategy.

Appendix A: Climate Change Background
This appendix summarizes climate change science, climate change projections, climate change references,
and supporting detail on projected climate change in the CAP service area.

A.1 Science of Climate Change
Climate change has been defined as a long-term change to the attributes that constitute the state of the
climate; e.g. surface and air temperatures, atmospheric composition, and radiation absorption. What
makes climate change significant is that the change to climatic conditions persists over long periods of
time (at scales larger than several decades). Short-term climate variability that occurs because of periodic
fluctuations such as teleconnection patterns; e.g. El Nino, La Nina, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO),
are therefore not considered contributors of climate change due to their shorter durations (several years).
Some of the literature uses the term climate change synonymously with global warming; however, there
is a distinction between the two terms. Climate change refers to a shift in climatic conditions that is
attributable to any type of source (anthropogenic or natural) and can occur in any direction (warming or
cooling). Global warming tends to refer strictly to heating patterns that are attributable to man-made
causes and is linked to the content level of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the earth's
atmosphere.
It is important to recognize that climate can change towards a cooling trend or a warming trend, and each
shift can take place and alter the existing climate in different ways. Climate is primarily determined by the
amount of radiation absorbed or reflected by the earth's surface and atmosphere. This in turn is
determined by the presence of certain types of particles in the earth's atmosphere that enhance solar
absorption or reflection (e.g. carbon dioxide or volcanic ash), the albedo on the earth's surface (albedo
determines the fraction of radiation absorbed or reflected at the surface), and physical characteristics of
the earth that hinder or promote radiation retention (e.g. orbital patterns and geographic locations of
oceans and landmasses). Therefore, it becomes clear that the different feedbacks and relationships
between climatic parameters can be complex and difficult to predict. However, the study of climate
change has advanced to a stage that modeling the state of the climate, along with examining historical
records of climate, has become a customary exercise for climate scientists.

A.1.1

Sources of Climate Change

Solar Radiation and the Energy Balance
The energy balance, the equilibrium of incoming and outgoing radiation in earth's atmosphere, is driven
by the magnitude of solar output from the sun. The level of radiation absorbed by the earth dictates the
type of climate it will experience (warmer vs. cooler). Variation in solar energy produced by the sun may
change over time. The frequency and number of sunspots, as well as magnetic storms that occur on the
sun, have shown to increase the emission of energy from the sun. The occurrence of sunspots tends to
follow a quasi-periodic cycle; where the maximum number and size of the sunspots coincide with the
length of the cycle. The two most commonly found cycles in solar observations are 11-year and 22-year
cycles. Even though these short-term periods may not fall under a significant portion of time to represent
climate change, historical records have shown that a 70-year period in the past (between 1645 to 1715)
called the Maunder minimum exhibited a significant lack of sunspots that resulted in a net decrease of
half a degree Celsius when compared to the long-term average. In addition, approximately four billion
years ago, the sun produced 30 percent less solar power than it does today, validating the possibility of
solar variation as a source of climate change.

Appendix A-1

Earth's Orbital Patterns
Changes in climate have also been attributed to variations in the earth's orbit, which affect the distribution
of incoming sunlight along seasonal and geographic lines. According to the Milankovitch theory (named
after astronomer Milutin Milankovitch), the combined effect of variations to three different orbital cycles
can lead to changes in the amount of solar radiation received by the earth's surface. These three
Milankovitch cycles are directly associated with the shape of the earth's orbit around the sun
(eccentricity), the axial tilt of the earth's axis (obliquity), and the earth's 'wobble' as it rotates along its axis
(precession).
The earth's eccentricity is altered over time as the earth continues to orbit around the sun. This orbit tends
to alternate from a circular shape to an elliptical shape and back every 100,000 years. Adjustments to the
earth's eccentricity due to this cycle translate to differences in incoming solar energy due to the earth's
proximity to the sun during its orbit. At periods of low eccentricity (more circular orbit), the earth's closest
approach to the sun during orbit (called the perihelion) receives approximately seven percent more
radiation than the earth's furthest approach to the sun during orbit (called the aphelion). Conversely, at
periods of high eccentricity (more elliptical orbit), the earth's atmosphere during a perihelion stage
receives approximately 20 percent more radiation than at an aphelion stage. Furthermore, extreme
eccentricity causes a subsequent change in the length of the seasons since more of the duration of the
earth's orbit occurs near the aphelion than the perihelion.
The earth's obliquity, or angle of axial tilt, also undergoes a cycle every 41,000 years. In that period, the
angle of tilt shifts from 22 degrees to 24.5 degrees and back. When the axial tilt is larger, there is increased
solar irradiation during the summer and less during the winter. The net result of this effect is larger
seasonal variability due to warmer summers and colder winters. However, when the axial tilt is decreased,
there is less seasonal variation as summer receives less irradiation while winters receive more, causing
summers to be cool and winters to be mild.
The earth's precession refers to the gyroscopic motion, or 'wobble', the earth makes as it rotates around
its axis (similar to a spinning top toy). This axial precession induces different seasonal variability between
the northern and southern hemispheres. During this cycle (which lasts between 23,000 and 25,000 years),
the hemisphere that is closer to the sun due to the precession will receive increased solar radiation and
as such will have greater variability in its seasons (e.g. hotter summer and colder winter). In contrast the
other hemisphere will have more temperate seasons (e.g. warmer winters and cooler summers).
Ocean Circulation and Heat Redistribution
Oceans play a large role in regulating the earth's climate; they store heat during the summer and release
heat during the winter, contributing to milder winters and more temperate summers. Since more of the
earth is covered by oceans rather than land (about 70 percent), a significant portion of the solar radiation
reaching earth is absorbed by its oceans. Furthermore, the oceans also circulate and transport this
absorbed heat around the earth before it is released into the atmosphere. Ocean heat transport is possible
through two types of circulation patterns: wind-driven surface currents and the density-driven
thermohaline circulation.
Wind-driven currents that transport absorbed solar heat at the water surface only move a limited volume
of water (about 10 percent of the earth's oceanic water), and consequently a smaller portion of the
absorbed heat. Thermohaline circulation is propelled by deep water currents and affects the majority of
the earth's ocean water (about 90 percent of the ocean). Deep waters develop where the air temperature
is cold and the salt content of the water is high. The combination of these two effects is denser water,
since dense water tends to be colder and possesses a higher salinity. As water moves towards the poles,
and becomes more saline and cold, the water's density increases and it sinks into deep ocean basins.
Dense water that is pushed away from the poles eventually moves into latitudes that allow for the gradual
warming of the water and its subsequent rise to the ocean surface, where the circulation cycle repeats.
Appendix A-2

This process of conversion of warm shallow currents (wind-driven) and cold and salty deep currents
(density-driven) and vice-versa is akin to an ocean circulation conveyer belt, which is the nickname given
to the thermohaline circulation it represents. Changes to the thermohaline circulation can contribute to
large-scale changes to the climate due to the large volumes of ocean water and stored heat it entails.
Chemical Composition of the Atmosphere
The chemical composition of the atmosphere and the presence of different types of particles and/or gases
in the atmosphere can impact climate in different ways depending on the effect these atmospheric
particles have with respect to incoming solar radiation; some may inhibit the absorption of solar radiation
and instigate a cooling effect, while others may promote solar absorption and induce a warming effect.
Additionally, the warming and cooling effects that these particles may cause can differ between the
atmosphere and the earth's surface.
Sulfate Aerosols
Examples of particles that reflect and scatter incoming sunlight include soil dust and sulfate aerosols.
Sulfate aerosols are produced from the combustion of fossil fuels that contain sulfur. When released into
the atmosphere these sulfate aerosols only last a few days and as such do not spread far from their point
of origin. Therefore, most sulfate aerosol concentrations in the atmosphere can be found near high sulfate
pollution production zones (primarily in the northern hemisphere). Additionally, sulfate aerosols assist in
cloud formation because sulfate particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (the atmospheric material
upon which clouds form). In addition to reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface,
clouds may also produce droplets that help to scatter incoming radiation. The net effect of this scattering
and reflecting of sunlight by sulfate aerosols is the cooling of surface temperatures.
Volcanic Eruptions
Other particles in the atmosphere have the opposite effect of absorbing incoming sunlight; prime
examples of this are smoky soot and volcanic dust or ash. Volcanic eruptions release ash and dust into the
atmosphere which can have a profound impact on climate, particularly if the eruption is heavily laden
with sulfur gases. The combination of volcanic eruption material and water vapor in the atmosphere
produces a dense layer of haze which can last for several years. This haze is then able to absorb incoming
solar radiation as well as reflect some of it back. This causes the surrounding air to be warmed, but surface
temperatures become cooler since a diminished amount of sunlight reaches the earth's surface.
Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming
The presence of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere also helps to absorb incoming radiation but
produces a different result than that of volcanic ash. Greenhouse gases include (in order of their
contribution to the greenhouse effect of warming) water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, and ozone.
Greenhouse gases have the effect of absorbing incoming solar radiation and emitting some of that
absorbed radiation as infrared energy to the earth's surface. Therefore, the increased presence of
greenhouse gases warms both atmospheric and surface temperatures. The rise of greenhouse gases in
the earth's atmosphere have been linked with global warming due to human-induced anthropogenic
activities such as the increased burning of fossil fuels and deforestation (which reduces the number of
plants that can convert carbon dioxide on the earth into oxygen).
Depletion of the Ozone Layer
The depletion of the ozone layer has in the past been mistakenly linked with global warming. The loss of
ozone is due to increased levels of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in the atmosphere, which are produced
from cooling units such as air conditioners, the release of aerosol spray propellants, and other chemical
processes.

Appendix A-3

Plate Tectonics
The slow (at a rate of millions of years) and constant shifting of the earth's tectonic plates have a longterm impact on the earth's topography by helping to shape the configuration of continents and oceans.
These changes in the earth's sea to landmass makeup can alter the existing mechanism of heat transport,
especially the thermohaline circulation pattern. Additionally, the ocean's capacity to regulate surface
temperatures becomes impacted if plate tectonics cause an increase in the earth's landmass and a
decrease in ocean water volume. Geologic evidence during the presence of the supercontinent Pangaea
300 million years ago illustrate that the climate behaved much differently than how it does today, with
the prevalence of large-scale monsoon circulation patterns and higher temperature variations.
Clouds and Surface Albedo
In addition to these major sources of climate change, the presence of other factors plays a role in how a
climate takes shape. The formation of clouds can influence the climate significantly as the presence of low
clouds may alter the energy balance of the earth. Clouds act like atmospheric buffers that can reflect a
large portion of incoming solar radiation. Thus, the abundance of low clouds supports a cooling effect.
Conversely, the lack of clouds can contribute to a warming effect, as more solar radiation is able to reach
the surface of the earth.
Albedo, or reflectivity, then plays a role in determining how much incoming solar radiation that reaches
the earth's surface is absorbed or reflected. Different types of land cover/surfaces (water, snow, grass,
etc.) have different albedo values distinguishing its reflectivity with respect to solar radiation; e.g. snow
has a significantly higher albedo than bare soil.

A.1.2

Indicators of Climate Change

The primary indicator of climate change is temperature measurements. However, current instrumental
temperature measurements only go as far back as the 19th century. To look at historical records before
that period for a longer duration of years (centuries to millenniums), scientists need to look at secondary
and indirect indicators of climate change (referred to as climate proxies) that enable them to reconstruct
a climate image of conditions in the past.
Another useful indicator of climate change is the change in global sea level. Much like temperature
measurements, current records using tide gauge measurements only go back so far (19th century), with
satellite data only being recently used. Longer historical records of sea level changes can be determined
by dating geological objects in the ocean such as coral reefs and coast sediments using carbon and
uranium-thorium dating methods.
Linked to changes in temperature and sea level are changes in precipitation and vegetation. Precipitation
can be determined using networks of precipitation gauges that are supplemented by satellite
observations. However for historical records that predate current precipitation gauges, scientists need to
look at other methods such as tree ring analysis or the sampling of ice cores.
Besides inferences on climate based on types of vegetation that grow and thrive in warmer vs. cooler
climates, the rate of change of climate has some consequence on the state of vegetation. Climate change
that is more radical, faster, or larger can cause stress to plants and vegetation loss to the extent of
desertification. Evidence of this occurring in the past is provided through the Carboniferous Rainforest
Collapse that took place 300 million years ago. During this event, rapid climate change caused much of
the expansive tropical rainforests that covered Europe and the Americas to decline into pockets of forests
that led to the extinction of much plant- and animal-life.
Dendroclimatology, or tree ring analysis, is one of the most reliable and extensive pieces of climate data
available that stretches back for thousands of years. By taking core samples from trees that have been in
existence for a remarkably long time, tree ring scientist can determine the local climate of different time
Appendix A-4

periods. These scientists are able to do this by looking at the growth pattern of tree rings. Wetter climates
are generally indicated by wide tree rings while drier climates can be inferred from narrow tree rings.
The drilling of ice cores in long-preserved ice sheets (such as in Antarctica) can provide even more
quantitative evidence of climate change. Through the use of isotope analysis, an ice core sample can
provide information on temperature, sea level, precipitation, and atmospheric composition of the time
periods that the ice core represents. Depending on the length of the ice core, some samples can trace
back to 800,000 years. Of particular interest when it comes to ice core analysis is the ability to establish
the changes to the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in time periods before the large increase in
recent decades. This information helps to provide a comparison point for evaluating the impact carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere may have in global warming.
Several other indicators are also linked to the condition of ice. The decline in the ice of the Arctic sea is a
strong indicator of a warming phase of climate change. In comparison to the Antarctic sea ice, which melts
and reforms completely with little to no loss, very little of the ice lost from the Arctic sea reforms. Recent
observations indicate a declining Arctic sea ice rate of 12 percent per decade (based on comparison to a
20-year average from 1980 to 2000).
Glaciers' sensitivity to temperature makes them reliable indicators of climate change. In warming periods
brought about by higher temperatures and lower precipitation, glaciers will shrink in size and retreat.
Conversely during cooling periods where temperatures remain low and precipitation is present, glaciers
may grow and advance. As such, establishing when a glacier advances or retreats also establishes whether
the climate is changing or not, especially when compared to some long-term mean of record to quantify
the magnitude of the change. In addition, glaciers produce moraines during their advance and retreat that
provide organic material and minerals that can be dated to correlate the time periods when a glacier
advanced or retreated, thus attaching a climate setting to an actual period of time.
Additionally, other evidence of climate change can be established using less rigorous and more
scientifically subjective methods. This includes examining archeology to determine the adverse effects of
climate change on prior populations and peoples, the examination of animal remains (e.g. beetles) and
species productivity (e.g. fishes) that are linked to different climatic patterns, and the analysis of pollen
(called palynology) and the changes to their type and size that may correspond to a changing climate.

A.2 Climate Change Projections
A.2.1

Methods of Projecting Climate Change Effects on Hydrology

Projecting climate change is an area of active research across the world. Currently, evaluation of climate
change effects on hydrology requires several steps, as depicted in Figure A-1. In summary, climate
variables (e.g., precipitation and temperature) are simulated on a coarse global scale by general
circulation models, also referred to as global climate models (GCMs). Typically, different GCMs are run,
with multiple initial conditions under a range of future emission scenarios, by different national and
international modeling groups. For each of these simulated potential futures, coarse global climate results
are “downscaled” to a finer resolution to facilitate the hydrologic assessment. The hydrologic assessment
typically includes three steps: 1) examining simulated precipitation and temperature at the land surface,
2) projecting associated runoff and 3) simulating streamflow in the built and natural environment
(reservoirs, diversions, etc.). This section summarizes methods used for all steps, from global climate
models to projections of streamflow.
Precipitation and temperature (climate) are projected on a global scale using GCMs, which simulate
physical processes in and between the ocean, atmosphere, land, and the cryosphere (ice-covered Earth
surface). There are numerous GCMs that were created for different purposes. All GCMs require input of
projected greenhouse gas emissions. As future greenhouse gas emissions are unknown, multiple
Appendix A-5

emissions scenarios are typically considered, ranging from status quo (continued increasing emissions) to
drastic reduction in emissions. GCM projections have coarse resolution, at about 100 to 200 km.
Due to the existence of numerous GCMs and potential emissions scenarios, the World Climate Research
Programme established the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) to standardize climate
projections for evaluations. CMIP results in a group of projections that use a consistent set of emissions
scenarios across multiple GCMs. CMIP has been used to support the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) assessments. The fourth IPCC assessment used CMIP phase 3 (CMIP3) projections, while
the fifth assessment used CMIP phase 5 projections (CMIP5).
For more regional or local analysis, GCM data are downscaled to increase their resolution. Downscaling
can be performed using multiple methods, and result in spatial resolution on the order of 1/8 degree
(about 12 km x 12 km) to 1/16 degree (about 6 km x 6 km). Additionally, global models often have
systematic “biases” due to coarse resolution and other model limitations. “Bias-correction” is performed
to reduce the differences between observed and simulated data12.

Figure A-1: Methodological approach for assessment of hydrology with climate change
From Reclamation (2012), Figure B-36.

Downscaled climate projections are then used as input to hydrologic models that estimate runoff. Based
on temperature, land cover, and soil characteristics, these models simulate what happens to the
precipitation and temperature at the land surface, and result in estimates of runoff and baseflow
12 There are multiple techniques for downscaling and bias correction, and this is an area of active research. Downscaling can be performed
statistically, dynamically using physically-based equations, or a combination of the two. Statistical downscaling is more common because it is
less computationally intensive. Some statistical techniques that are typically used for downscaling and bias correction are “Bias-Corrected
Spatial Downscaling” and “Localized Constructed Analogs.” Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaling results in spatial resolution within the U.S. of
1/8-degree; Localized Constructed Analogs results in spatial resolution of 1/16-degree.
Appendix A-6

(percolation beyond plants’ roots). The most commonly used land surface model is the Variable
Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, developed by the University of Washington.
Runoff and baseflow are then input to a streamflow routing model to generate projections of natural
streamflow (without human influences such as reservoirs, diversions, etc.). At this step, bias-correction
may be performed again, based on observed historical streamflow. The United States Bureau of
Reclamation (Reclamation), as part of the Westwide Climate Risk Assessment (WWCRA), has developed
CMIP3 and CMIP5 projections of natural streamflow for the eight major Reclamation Basins, covering the
majority of the western United States, using both CMIP3 (Reclamation, 2011) and CMIP5 (Reclamation,
2016)13.
Once natural streamflow projections are developed, the impacts of potential changes can be evaluated
using models that consider operations. Reclamation, as part of the WWCRA, has performed impact
assessments for four basins to date: Upper Rio Grande, Sacramento/San Joaquin, Columbia River, and
Missouri River.

A.2.2

Colorado River Basin Projections

The most comprehensive evaluation of climate change effects in the Colorado River Basin is Reclamation’s
Colorado River Basin Study, released in 2012 (Reclamation, 2012). Climate change effects were evaluated
based on 112 CMIP3 climate model projections, downscaled and bias corrected using the Bias-Corrected
Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) approach. Results suggest that average temperature across the Colorado River
Basin is projected to increase by 1.3 ⁰C, 2.4 ⁰C, and 3.3 ⁰C in years 2025, 2055, and 2080 (Figure A-2), with
greater changes in the Upper Colorado River Basin than in the Lower Colorado River Basin (Figure A-3).
Precipitation, on an annual basis, is generally projected to change by less than five percent, with increasing
variability (Figure A-2). Projections are consistent with historical observed data, in which there is a
noticeable increase in observed temperature in the Colorado River Basin since about 1980 (Figure A-2).

13 Reclamation, in their hydroclimate projections, used Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaling for both CMIP3 (Reclamation, 2011) and CMIP5
(Reclamation, 2016). There are 112 climate model projections in the CMIP3 Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaled dataset, based on 16 GCM and
three emissions scenarios (high, medium, and low), with most GCMs run with more than one initial condition. There are 231 projections in the
CMIP5 Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaled dataset, based on 36 GCMs and four emissions scenarios (high, medium by year 2040, medium by
year 2080, and low), and multiple initial conditions. Reclamation used 97 out of the 231 Bias-Corrected Spatial Downscaled CMIP5 projections
for their hydroclimate projections (using a single set of initial conditions for each GCM-emission scenario combination). These data, along with
projections using other downscaling techniques, are available at https://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/downscaled_cmip_projections/dcpInterface.html.
Appendix A-7

Hydrology was evaluated in the Colorado River Basin Study (Reclamation, 2012). Results suggest that
evapotranspiration will increase, and runoff will decrease (Figure A-4). The result is a decrease in annual
average water availability from the Colorado River. Mean annual flows from 2011 to 2060 are projected
to be 13.7 million acre-feet (MAF), or about a six percent reduction from the period 1950-1999 (14.6 MAF)
or a nine percent reduction from the period 1906 to 2007 (15.0 MAF) (Figure A-5). However, the median
projection is 12.7 MAF, or 1.0 MAF less than the mean. In most projections, there is also a shift towards
runoff occurring earlier in the spring, primarily due to earlier snow melt (Reclamation, 2012). The Colorado
River Basin Study projected a supply and demand imbalance in year 2060 ranging from 0 to 6.8 MAF, with
a median of 3.2 MAF (Reclamation, 2012)14.
Since the Colorado River Basin Study in 2012, which was based on CMIP3 results, Reclamation has
developed hydroclimate projections using CMIP5. Comparison of the results suggest that CMIP5 projects
similar temperature increases as CMIP3 and greater precipitation than CMIP3. The median CMIP5 BCSD
streamflows result show greater projected water availability from the Colorado River (almost no change
from historical average) than CMIP3 projected streamflows (see Figure A-6, “annual runoff”). There is a
wider range in the CMIP5 projected changes of streamflows. However, Reclamation (2014) notes that
“even though CMIP5 is newer, it has not been determined to be a better or more reliable source of climate
projections compared to existing CMIP3 projections.” Furthermore, the IPCC suggests that the datasets
are complementary.

14 Note that this projection included paleo and paleo reconstructed supply projections.

Water availability in the Colorado River Basin remains an area of ongoing active research (e.g., Vano et al.
2014; Carrillo et al. 2017; Ficklin et al. 2016). A recent paper by Udall and Overpeck (2017) argues that
temperatures strongly contribute to reduced flows, as evidenced by recent “hot drought” conditions in
the Colorado River Basin. Because GCM-projected temperatures consistently show higher projected
temperatures whereas precipitation projections vary and are less certain, the resultant conclusion is that
available water in the Colorado River may be less than what Reclamation is currently forecasting. McCabe
(2017) also suggests that warming, not just precipitation, is a significant factor in reducing flows.

CAP Service Area Projections

This section summarizes historical and projected climate in the CAP service area. Effects of climate change
in Arizona and the Southwest have been summarized in the National Climate Assessment and by the
Climate Assessment of the Southwest (CLIMAS) as well as by Reclamation and others.

Figure A-7: Historical observed temperature and precipitation, CAP service area
Data from DRI (2018). Average temperature and precipitation across Maricopa and Pinal Counties (Arizona Climate
Division 6)

Historical observed climate data suggest rising temperatures in the CAP service area since about 1980
(Figure A-7). Climate projections consistently show continued increasing annual average temperatures
Appendix A-12

(Figure A-8 presents projections for Phoenix; Figure A-3 shows spatial variability of projections across
Arizona), with a median increase of about five degrees F by late century. Additionally, projected maximum
temperatures are projected to increase by about five degrees F (Figure A-9).

Historical observed precipitation is variable, with below average precipitation since about 2000 (Figure A7). Future precipitation trends in Arizona are less certain than temperature trends; projections show a
high degree of precipitation variability with no increasing or decreasing trend (Figure A-8). The National
Climate Assessment projects increasing intensity of storms across the southwest (Melillo, et al., 2014).
Intensity of storms can be approximated by evaluating projected maximum daily precipitation. Figure A10 shows that median maximum daily precipitation is expected to increase by four, eight, and seven
percent in the early, mid, and late future periods. More than half the projections suggest an increase in
the 1-day annual maximum precipitation value in the Phoenix area, although there is no apparent
projected increasing trend in this flood metric through time in the 21st century.

15 231-projection CMIP5 and 112-projection CMIP3 ensembles were used in the analyses to characterize future changes. CMIP5 GCMs were
run using four relative concentration pathways (RCPs) that represent future greenhouse gas concentrations (RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5). The
older climate projections in the CMIP3 ensemble use Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) scenarios to represent future emissions
scenarios (SRESB1, SRESA1B, SRESA2). The last three CMIP5 RCPs listed are roughly analogous to the CMIP3 SRES scenarios, but CMIP3 has no
RCP2.6 equivalent. This could potentially affect results by the exclusion of lower temperature projections in the CMIP3 ensemble.

A.3 Climate Change References
This section summarizes references for assessments of climate change and potential impacts on
hydrology. It starts with global references, working towards local references.
Globally, the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) publishes regular global climate assessments.
From IPCC, “The IPCC is the international body for assessing the science related to climate change. The
IPCC was set up in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP) to provide policymakers with regular assessments of the scientific basis
of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation.” The IPCC has
produced five assessments to date, and is currently in its Sixth Assessment cycle. Assessments, along with
other reports and information about the IPCC, can be found at http://www.ipcc.ch/.
Specific to water resources, Reclamation, as manager of the Colorado River and other major western
rivers, has done extensive projections of water supply with climate change as part of the WaterSMART
initiative and meeting authorizations of the Secure Water Act. Reclamation’s work, referenced in the main
body of this document, can be accessed from https://www.usbr.gov/watersmart/wcra/.
Within the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) is mandated to publish an
assessment of global change in the United States every four years. From USGCRP, “The USGCRP was
established by Presidential Initiative in 1989 and mandated by Congress in the Global Change Research
Act (GCRA) of 1990 to ‘assist the Nation and the world to understand, assess, predict, and respond to
human-induced and natural processes of global change” (USGCRP, 2018). The USGCRP published their
third national assessment in 2014 (https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/) and in 2017 completed Volume 1
Appendix A-15

of the Fourth National Climate Assessment (https://science2017.globalchange.gov/). USGCRP notes that
“Assessments integrate findings of the USGCRP with the results of research and observations from across
the U.S. and around the world, including reports from the U.S. National Research Council.” The reports
document “climate change related impacts and responses for various sectors and regions, with the goal
of better informing public and private decision-making at all levels” (Melillo, et al., 2014).
The National Climate Assessment has a chapter devoted to climate change in the Southwest, including
most of the Colorado River Basin and all of Arizona and CAP’s service area. More locally, the Climate
Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS), housed at the University of Arizona, works “to improve the ability
of the region’s [Arizona and New Mexico] social and ecological systems to respond to and thrive in a
variable and changing climate” (CLIMAS, 2018). CLIMAS is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration’s (NOAA’s) Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments (RISA) program. Numerous
studies and reports on local effects of climate change can be found at the CLIMAS website
(http://www.climas.arizona.edu/).
Additionally, numerous researchers publish their own assessments of climate change and potential
impacts on water supply, both regionally and locally. Similarly, numerous agencies, including water
agencies, either build upon work done by Reclamation or others or develop their own research and
publications related to potential effects of climate change on water supply. CAP has been involved in
multiple studies and work efforts, as summarized in Section 1.2.

and Strategies by Function
This appendix summarizes analysis of implications and strategies by function. CAP’s organizational
functions that were part of the team (as described in section 2.2) were individually assessed to determine
their vulnerabilities and their ability to adapt to risk (by analyzing the implications that affect them and
the adaptation strategies they are a part of). The 16 CAP organizational functions that were addressed in
this adaptation planning effort were:
•

Central Arizona Groundwater Replenishment District (CAGRD)

•

Colorado River Programs

•

Communications

•

Engineering

•

Environmental, Health and Safety

•

Financial Planning and Analysis

•

Human Resources

•

Information Technology

•

Legal Services

•

Maintenance

•

Operational Technology

•

Protective Services

•

Public Affairs

•

Resource Planning and Analysis

•

Risk and Liability Management

•

Water Operations and Power Programs

C.1 Financial Planning and Analysis
Financial Planning and Analysis is fairly sensitive to climate change, with 16 implications (above average
for functions), and is very responsive to climate change, with 33 strategies (tied for second most of any
function). Implications and strategies associated with Financial Planning and Analysis are presented in
Table C-1 and Table C-2 and are summarized below.

Appendix C-1

Table C-1: Implications that affect Financial Planning and Analysis
Challenge Implications
#1. Increased cost to customers –
supply driven.
#2. Increased cost to customers –
power driven.

Opportunity Implications
#19. Increased tax base.
#20. Increased power
supplies/reduced power cost.

Mixed Implications
#55. Cutbacks to other agencies
resulting in need for CAP to do
other’s work.

#3. Increased cost to customers –
demand driven.
#4. Reduced ability of customers to
pay rates.
#5. Rate instability.
#6. Decreased tax base.
#7. Financial reserves drawn down.
#8. Pressure to defer capital
projects and technological
advances.
#10. Limited or no excess water for
CAGRD.
#12. Difficulty projecting longrange rates.
#31. New facilities needed: wells,
potential treatment.
#32. Reduced power production.
#34. Air quality regulations affect
how and when power can be used.

The implications affecting Financial Planning and Analysis reflect issues associated with changes in sources
of revenue generation (rates, taxation, and power generation/use) and their associated impacts (e.g.
deferring projects, triggering recovery, and depleting financial reserves). Rising costs and water rates and
the inability of CAP customers to pay them is largely connected to the economic health of the region and
the availability of Colorado River water supply. The generation of revenue from CAP’s taxation authority
is based on population growth. Several other implications are also linked to these fluctuations in revenue
generation. Relying more heavily on CAP’s financial reserves to compensate for reduced revenue from
CAP customers is a likely outcome. In addition, reduced revenue leads to a reduced operating budget,
which causes deferment of projects and activities (implication #8). The availability of Colorado River
supply also affects the ability to generate revenue from the CAGRD (e.g. implication #10), power
production (e.g. implication # 32), and the need for direct recovery of groundwater credits (e.g.
implication #31).
Only one implication exclusively affects Financial Planning and Analysis, implication #12 (Difficulty
projecting long-range rates), which is primarily an activity associated with this function. Financial Planning
Appendix C-2

and Analysis also shares the highest number of implications (eight) with Public Affairs and
Communications. These shared implications are also associated with changes to rates and taxation and
the ability of CAP customers to pay. And while these impacts to sources of CAP revenue directly implicate
Financial Planning and Analysis, communication of these changes to CAP stakeholders, customers, and
the public requires and affects Public Affairs and Communications.

Most of the strategies that involve Financial Planning and Analysis (see Table C-2) address the revenue
generating issues that are reflected in the implications from Table C-1. Eight strategies that involve
Financial Planning and Analysis do not address any of the implications that affect Financial Planning and
Analysis. Furthermore, one implication, “Air quality regulations affect how and when power can be used”
(implication #34), is not addressed by any of the strategies that involve Financial Planning and Analysis.
Implication #34 is addressed by three other strategies (strategies #39, 80, and 81) that include several
other functions.
Eleven strategies exclusively involve Financial Planning and Analysis, making them primarily the
responsibility of Financial Planning and Analysis to implement. Out of the 11 strategies that exclusively
involve Financial Planning and Analysis and the eight strategies that involve Financial Planning and
Analysis but do not address Financial Planning and Analysis implications, there are only two strategies
that exclusively involve Financial Planning and Analysis that address only non-Financial Planning and
Analysis implications. These two strategies that exclusively rely on Financial Planning and Analysis
(strategies #70 and #85) target implications for the benefit of Maintenance, Water Operations and Power
Programs, Engineering, and Operational Technology. Of the strategies that involve Financial Planning and
Analysis and other CAP functions, the highest number of strategies (eight) is shared with Engineering.

C.2 Maintenance
Maintenance is very sensitive to climate change, with 25 implications (second most of all functions), and
is fairly responsive to climate change, with 18 strategies (about average for functions). Implications and
strategies associated with Maintenance are presented in Table C-3 and Table C-4 and are summarized
below.

Challenge implications that affect Maintenance constitute physical challenges to performing maintenance
on the CAP canal, impacts to CAP infrastructure, and/or risks to maintenance staff working on the canal.
Predominant drivers to these challenges include warmer/hotter temperatures and increased extreme
precipitation events. Physical challenges to canal maintenance include increased biological control, water
sedimentation issues, and degraded water quality. Impacts to infrastructure include land subsidence near
the canal and weather damage to infrastructure and facilities, both increasing the frequency of
maintenance on CAP equipment. Risks to maintenance staff include health issues from increased exposure
due to climate and weather, and safety issues from illegal diversions, vandalism/theft, and encroachment.
Opportunity implications for Maintenance revolve around increased efficiency in the areas of
maintenance and water operations. All of the implications that affect Maintenance also affect other
functions; there are no implications exclusive to Maintenance. Not surprisingly, due to the mutual
function emphasis on the CAP canal, Maintenance shares the largest number of implications with Water
Operations and Power Programs (18).

All strategies that involve Maintenance address implications that affect Maintenance. However, several
(seven) Maintenance-related implications are not addressed by strategies that involve Maintenance.
These seven implications include safety issues and aspects of maintenance and operations that only other
CAP functions can primarily address. Examples of safety issues include increased accidents due to extreme
weather events (mainly addressed by Human Resources, and Risk and Liability Management-centric
strategies) and issues related to illegal canal diversions and encroachment on CAP lands (which would
require strategies that are spearheaded by Protective Services). Implications that affect Maintenance but
require other CAP functions to address include “Interruptions in power service (transmission)”
(implication #33) and “Increased operational efficiency” (implication #38).
The implications from Table C-3 that cover the areas of physical challenges to maintenance, impacts to
infrastructure, and risks to maintenance staff are addressed by adaptation strategies in Table C-4. Just as
the case was for the highest number of shared implications, Maintenance also has the highest number of
shared adaptation strategies with Water Operations and Power Programs. Only one adaptation strategy
is exclusively implementable by Maintenance, since it is an activity wholly within that function’s purview:
“Change maintenance schedule to reduce costs” (strategy #83). This strategy also exclusively addresses a
single implication: “Change in seasonal demand curve” (implication #36). Changes in seasonal water
demand from CAP customers can allow Maintenance to adjust their canal maintenance schedule to
optimally achieve their work tasks and cut costs.

C.3 Operational Technology
Operational Technology is moderately sensitive to climate change, with 11 implications (below average
for functions), and is not very responsive to climate change, with 10 strategies (fourth fewest of all
functions). Implications and strategies associated with Operational Technology are presented in Table C5 and Table C-6 and are summarized below.

Appendix C-7

#29. Decreased operational head.
#33. Interruptions in power service
(transmission).
#34. Air quality regulations affect

#49. Increased theft of
copper/vandalism.

The implications affecting Operational Technology (summarized in Table C-5) impact the CAP canal and
infrastructure that Operational Technology supports. Changes in operational and maintenance efficiency
(e.g. implications #38 and #39), power usage and availability (implications #33 and #34), and the safety
and condition of CAP equipment and facilities (e.g. implications #27 and #49) have a direct consequence
to Operational Technology performing its duties. The implications that affect Operational Technology are
also mostly shared with Maintenance (10 implications affecting Operational Technology are shared by
Maintenance). The importance of maintaining the integrity of the CAP canal, through optimal
maintenance and electronic system support, explains the high number of shared implications between
Maintenance and Operational Technology. Because of these shared priorities, Operational Technology is
not exclusively affected by any implication, and furthermore, none of the strategies that involve
Operational Technology (see Table C-6) are exclusively implemented by that function.

The adaptation strategies that involve Operational Technology primarily benefit other functions, with a
few exceptions. For example, strategies #52 (“Add more real-time water quality monitors and sampling
on canal”), #45 (“Apply new technology/projects, e.g. UV treatment”), and #56 (“Pursue infrastructure
improvements to minimize specific sedimentation impacts to operations”) all aim to enhance system
maintenance and water operations. In fact, only four of the 10 strategies that include Operational
Technology address implications that are of significance to Operational Technology. And these four
strategies only address four Operational Technology implications, leaving seven implications that are
primarily addressed by other functions. Due to most Operational Technology strategies emphasizing
improvements to canal operations, Operational Technology shares the highest number of strategies with
Water Operations and Power Programs (eight).

C.4 Water Operations and Power Programs
Water Operations and Power Programs is very sensitive to climate change, with 28 implications (the most
of all functions), and also very responsive to climate change, with 33 strategies (tied for second most of
all functions). Implications and strategies associated with Water Operations and Power Programs are
presented in Table C-7 and Table C-8 and are summarized below.

Implications to Water Operations and Power Programs generally fall under five different areas:
1. Diversions from the Colorado River
2. Conveyance of water in the canal
3. Power resources supporting the CAP system
4. Operations and management of the CAP system
5. Integrity and reliability of the canal
Implications that affect CAP’s diversions from the Colorado River include limited diversions due to Lake
Mead being low, and consequently Arizona suffering a Lower Colorado River Basin shortage; this
implication assumes that CAP will take all or most of that shortage reduction (implication #15). Another
implication that is connected to diversions from the Colorado River is having to continually adjust to a
shifting or flexible regulatory environment (implication #53). This implication can alter when and how CAP
Appendix C-10

diverts its Colorado River allocation. The conveyance of water in the CAP canal can be influenced by
implications that are also of relevance to Maintenance. These implications include increases in algae,
vegetation, invasive species, and sedimentation in the canal (implications #21 and 24), which could alter
the capacity of the canal and the movement of water in it.
The availability of power resources necessary to operate and transport water through the canal is also
considered in the implications for Water Operations and Power Programs. Power-related implications
consider increases and reductions/interruptions to power (implications #20, #32, and #33), and changes
to power usage schedules (implication #34). Implications that alter how the CAP system is managed
through operations span many issues such as reduced demands and deliveries (implications #9 and #37),
challenges to storing excess water (implication #16), reduced storage in Lake Pleasant (implication #28),
changes in seasonal demand (implication #36), and increased operational and maintenance
efficiency/flexibility (implications #39, #39, and #40). Finally, risks that threaten the integrity and reliability
of the CAP canal include land subsidence near the canal (implication #26), damage to CAP infrastructure
due to extreme weather (implication #27), and illegal diversions from the canal (implication #47).

Due to the close interconnection of issues that link water operations and canal maintenance, Water
Operations and Power Programs shares the highest number of implications (18) and strategies (nine) with
Maintenance. There are no implications that only affect Water Operations and Power Programs. However,
seven of the implications in Table C-7 are not addressed by any of the strategies that include Water
Operations and Power Programs in Table C-8.
With regards to strategies, Water Operations and Power Programs are associated with nine strategies that
can only be implemented by the Water Operations and Power Programs function. There are also nine
strategies that require Water Operations and Power Programs’ participation to implement but these nine
strategies do not address any Water Operations and Power Programs implications. Out of the nine
strategies that are exclusive to Water Operations and Power Programs and the nine strategies that do not
address Water Operations and Power Programs implications, there is only one strategy that can only be
implemented by Water Operations and Power Programs for the benefit of other functions. This is strategy
#12 (“Reduce operations/lower power costs”). Strategy #12 exclusively addresses implication #3
(“Increased cost to customers – demand driven”). Implication #3 has repercussions for Financial Planning
and Analysis (as it correlates to revenue generation), Public Affairs, and Communications (who have to
communicate the increase in cost to customers and the public).

C.5 Engineering
Engineering is fairly sensitive to climate change, with 15 implications (about average for functions), and
also fairly responsive to climate change, with 18 strategies (about average for functions). Implications and
strategies associated with Engineering are presented in Table C-9 and Table C-10 and are summarized
below.

#33. Interruptions in power service
(transmission).
#48. Increased encroachment on
CAP lands.
#52. Increased permitting
time/cost.
#53. Continuous adjusting to
regulatory environment.

Challenge implications for Engineering from Table C-9 generally impede that function’s ability to meet its
objectives of designing asset modifications, supporting construction projects, and providing construction
management services for all major capital improvements by limiting or delaying access (physically and
time-wise) to CAP infrastructure in need of Engineering support. Increased maintenance on CAP
equipment and facilities (implication #25), land subsidence occurring near the CAP canal (implication #26),
and increased encroachment on CAP property (implication #48) are all implications that limit access to
CAP assets that may require engineering work. Examples of implications that delay the completion of
engineering work include pressure to defer capital projects (implication #8), increased permitting time
and costs (implication #52), and dealing with regulations that continue to change (implication #53).
Opportunity implications on the other hand provide the opposite effect, by improving Engineering’s
access to CAP infrastructure in order to optimally complete engineering projects and activities. Increased
operation and maintenance efficiency and flexibility (implications #38, #39, and #40) enhances
Engineering’s ability to conduct capital improvement and asset modification projects. Since the emphasis
of the implications that are relevant to Engineering is on CAP assets and infrastructure, Engineering shares
the highest number of implications with Maintenance. And since implications that target issues associated
with CAP infrastructure affect numerous functions, Engineering has no implications that do not also affect
other functions.

Strategies associated with Engineering from Table C-10 support the improvement of CAP infrastructure
through capital projects; e.g. increasing collaboration on infrastructure issues (strategy #26),
infrastructure improvements to mitigate effects from extreme weather, sedimentation, and subsidence
(strategies #54, #56, and #63), and pursuing new capital projects (strategy #72). Since most of
Engineering’s strategies are closely linked to CAP infrastructure (of which the CAP canal is a primary asset),
Engineering has the most shared number of strategies with Water Operations and Power Programs.
Most of the strategies that involve Engineering address implications that are relevant to Engineering, with
the exception of three strategies that target non-Engineering implications. However, there are six
Engineering implications (implications #30, # 38, #39, #40, #48, and #53) that are not addressed by
Engineering strategies – these implications are addressed by strategies involving other functions such as
Appendix C-15

Financial Planning and Analysis, Water Operations and Power Programs, and Human Resources. One
strategy that only Engineering can implement is strategy #63 (“Specific infrastructure improvements to
limit damage to CAP infrastructure and facilities (e.g., from subsidence and weather)). This Engineeringdriven strategy attempts to resolve several implications: land subsidence near the canal (implication #26),
potential damage to CAP infrastructure and facilities from weather (implication #27), and interruptions in
power service and transmission (implication #33).

C.6 Information Technology
Information Technology is not very sensitive to climate change, with seven implications (tied for fewest of
all functions), nor is it very responsive to climate change, with seven strategies (tied for second fewest of
all functions). Implications and strategies associated with Information Technology are presented in Table
C-11 and Table C-12 and are summarized below.

#33. Interruptions in power service

#35. Limited IT resources:

refreshes, technology lagging
behind.
#49. Increased theft of
copper/vandalism.

Information Technology provides a support role that enables other CAP functions to better perform their
duties. The challenge implications that afflict Information Technology reflect interruptions or limitations
in the ability to provide that support to CAP. Cascading financial effects borne of a weak economy can
lead to expected implications such as having to defer technological advances (implication #8) and utilizing
limited information technology resources (implication #35). Other implications that are unexpected or
sudden can be directly linked to climate change effects and are associated with impacts to CAP assets and
facilities that can cause an interruption in Information Technology services. Examples include damage to
CAP facilities due to extreme weather events (implication #27) and vandalism of CAP equipment and
hardware (implication #49). This vulnerability to implications that affect CAP infrastructure and facilities
is another reason why Information Technology has the highest shared number of implications (six) with
Maintenance and Operational Technology. Similarly, due to being involved in strategies that address
technological issues, Information Technology shares the highest number of strategies with Operational
Technology (six). There is only one implication, limited information technology resources (implication #
35) that exclusively affects Information Technology.

None of the strategies in Table C-12 are unique to Information Technology. Most of the strategies that
involve Information Technology address Information Technology implications – with the exception of two
strategies (strategies #52 and #108). However, the strategies that do address Information Technology
implications only address three of the seven implications that Information Technology faces (implications
#8, #35, and #55), making Information Technology dependent on other functions to implement strategies
that target Information Technology implications.

C.7 Resource Planning and Analysis
Resource Planning and Analysis is moderately sensitive to climate change, with 14 implications (about
average for functions), and is also fairly responsive to climate change, with 19 strategies (above average
for functions). Implications and strategies associated with Resource Planning and Analysis are presented
in Table C-13 and Table C-14 and are summarized below.

#55. Cutbacks to other agencies
resulting in need for CAP to do
other’s work.

#46. More scrutiny placed on
planning.

Since a large portion of Resource Planning and Analysis’ activities are associated with the CAP service area,
Resource Planning and Analysis implications are either associated with their ability to conduct long-range
planning for the service area or associated with water deliveries to CAP customers within the CAP service
area (which in turn shapes Resource Planning and Analysis’ long-range planning activities). Implications
such as difficulties in seeking solutions without collaborative partners (implications #44 and #45),
enhanced partnerships and collaborative environment (implications #58 and #59), more scrutiny or less
urgency placed on planning (implications #46 and #61) and the need to do the work of other agencies
(implication #55) affect how Resource Planning and Analysis performs its work. Implications such as higher
or lower water demand (implications #14 and #36), less or more water available to the service area
(implications #9 and #13), and water storage issues (implications #16 and #31) affect Resource Planning
and Analysis’ work directly. No single implication or strategy (from Table C-13 and Table C-14) uniquely
affects Resource Planning and Analysis or solely relies on Resource Planning and Analysis for
implementation, respectively.

The strategies that involve Resource Planning and Analysis directly address the aforementioned
implication themes with respect to the CAP service area and Resource Planning and Analysis’ duties. These
strategies, in Table C-14, comprehensively address all of the implications that affect Resource Planning
and Analysis – with one exception. Implication #36 (“Change in seasonal demand curve”) does have
relevance to Resource Planning and Analysis as it affects how and when CAP customers utilize their water
deliveries, but the majority of the strategies that address this implication are under the purview of Water
Operations and Power Programs, and Maintenance.
With a larger number of strategies available than the number of implications that Resource Planning and
Analysis faces, there are two strategies co-implemented by Resource Planning and Analysis that do not
target Resource Planning and Analysis implications (strategies #3 and #6). However, these strategies
provide a benefit to other CAP functions that need to adapt to the implications these strategies attempt
to resolve. Shared water policy concerns and reliance on Colorado River water supplies to meet function
objectives, links Resource Planning and Analysis with Colorado River Programs and CAGRD. This
connection is also evident in the number of shared implications and strategies. Resource Planning and
Analysis shares the highest number of implications with CAGRD (11) and the highest number of strategies
with Colorado River Programs and CAGRD (12).

C.8 Colorado River Programs
Colorado River Programs is moderately sensitive to climate change, with 12 implications (below average
for functions), and is also moderately responsive to climate change, with 13 strategies (below average for
functions). Implications and strategies associated with Colorado River Programs are presented in Table C15 and Table C-16 and are summarized below.

#53. Continuous adjusting to

Colorado River Programs’ implications focus on scenario outcomes related to CAP’s Colorado River water
supply, and water policy planning issues. Implications that are directly relevant to the Colorado River
supply include limited CAP diversions from the river due to a Lower Basin shortage (e.g. implication #15)
or increased consumptive use from higher priority Colorado River users in Arizona (e.g. implication #13).
Beyond the planning efforts that Colorado River Programs provides with respect to CAP’s Colorado River
supply, this function also helps to shape Colorado River Basin water policy in conjunction and
collaboration with other water users from across the basin (as well as the Bureau of Reclamation and the
Republic of Mexico). Therefore, implications that obstruct or assist in collaborative policy goals have huge
consequences for Colorado River Programs. Examples of implications that may play a role in Colorado
River Programs’ efforts to contribute to Colorado River Basin water policy by cooperatively working with
other users include difficulty collaborating due to lack of staff (implication #45), meeting environmental
and regulatory requirements (implications #51 and #53), and increased non-traditional partnerships
(implication #58). Other implications affect Colorado River Programs’ ability to conduct planning efforts
in general (e.g. implications #46 and #61).

The adaptation strategies which involve Colorado River Programs collectively address all of Colorado River
Programs’ implications, less two. The only Colorado River Programs implications not targeted by a
Colorado River Programs strategy are implications #51 (“Challenges meeting environmental
requirements”) and #53 (“Continuous adjusting to regulatory environment”). As discussed, implication
#53 can be a significant impediment in how Colorado River Programs works towards implementing new
Colorado River policies with other Colorado River Basin partners.
Since Colorado River Programs’ responsibilities are intrinsically conjoined to the Colorado River and the
water supply that CAP diverts from the river to meet CAP’s mission and vision, Colorado River Programs
activities can be implicitly and explicitly germane to other functions within CAP. Consequently, all the
implications and strategies that are relevant to Colorado River Programs are also relevant to at least one
other CAP function – with high relevance to one function in particular. The similarities in the adaptation
challenges and solutions that Colorado River Programs and Resource Planning and Analysis share can be
seen between Tables C-13 and C-15 (implications), and Tables C-14 and C-16 (strategies), respectively.
Colorado River Programs shares the highest number of implications (nine) and strategies (12) with
Resource Planning and Analysis.

C.9 CAGRD
CAGRD is fairly sensitive to climate change, with 15 implications (about average for functions), and is
moderately responsive to climate change, with 17 strategies (about average for functions). Implications
and strategies associated with CAGRD are presented in Table C-17 and Table C-18 and are summarized
below.

#59. Collaborative planning

#61. Less urgency for short-term
water policy planning, affording
flexibility and proactive, not
reactive, response.

#46. More scrutiny placed on
planning.

A number of the implications affecting the CAGRD in Table C-17 are very specific to the CAGRD
(implications #10, #11, #17, and #18), with three of these four CAGRD-specific implications only affecting
the CAGRD (implication #10 also affects Financial Planning and Analysis since there is reduced revenue
when CAP cannot provide excess water to CAGRD). Implications #10 and #11 are challenge implications
associated with the CAGRD having a severely limited water supply due to no excess water available from
CAP and CAGRD being out of credits and/or unable to acquire other Arizona on-river water supplies.
Opportunity implications #17 and #18 are virtually the opposite of the CAGRD-specific challenge
implications. Implications #17 and #18 present outcomes where CAGRD supply is more than sufficient to
meet its obligations.
Another implication that provides an interesting contrast to these CAGRD-specific implications, is the
mixed challenge/opportunity implication #13. The full entitlement use of higher priority Colorado River
water users in Arizona poses a challenge in that there would be a reduction to CAP’s on-river diversion
and thus the reduced availability of excess CAP water for CAGRD. The potential opportunity from this
implication is that there is greater opportunity for CAGRD to acquire on-river water supplies from these
higher priority on-river water users. The remaining implications to the CAGRD deal with the general
availability of Colorado River water to CAP customers (e.g. implications #9 and #14), influences on water
policy planning and partnerships (e.g. implications #46, #58, and #61), and ability to collaborate
(implications #44 and #45).

The combination of CAGRD strategies in Table C-18 address all of the CAGRD implications in Table C-17.
Two of those strategies can only be implemented by the CAGRD – strategy #32 (“Look to CAGRD to help
supplement other areas”) and strategy #41 (“Reduce CAGRD water supply acquisition”). Since the
implications and strategies that are pertinent to the CAGRD are linked to the CAP service area and the
supply available to CAP customers, there is significant overlap between CAGRD and Resource Planning
and Analysis. CAGRD has the highest number of shared implications (11) and strategies (12) with Resource
Planning and Analysis.

Environmental, Health and Safety

Environmental, Health and Safety is not very sensitive to climate change, with eight implications (third
fewest of all functions), and is moderately responsive to climate change, with 12 strategies (below average
for functions). Implications and strategies associated with Environmental, Health and Safety are presented
in Table C-19 and Table C-20 and are summarized below.

Challenge implications for Environmental, Health and Safety that fall under the environmental category
include air quality regulations affecting power use (implication #34) and dealing with shifting
environmental regulations (implications #51 and #53). Health and safety challenge implications have a
more direct effect on CAP infrastructure and employees; e.g. increased accidents and damage to facilities
due to more extreme weather events (implications #27 and #42), and health concerns due to higher
temperatures in Arizona (implication #41). A large number of these implications, especially those that are
most connected to health and safety, have consequences to CAP employees that regularly work in the
field and are exposed to a higher potential of accidents, weather events, and heat illnesses. Maintenance
constitutes the largest number of CAP employees that could be affected by these Environmental, Health
and Safety challenge implications. Unsurprisingly, Environmental, Health and Safety also has the highest
number of shared implications with Maintenance (seven).

With the exception of one strategy (strategy #3), all of the strategies in Table C-20 address Environmental,
Health and Safety implications in Table C-19. Likewise, all Environmental, Health and Safety implications
can be addressed by Environmental, Health and Safety strategies. Most of the strategies in Table C-20 are
highly relevant to Environmental, Health and Safety (e.g. strategies #48 and #118) but all of them require
the participation of other functions to implement (similarly none of the implications in Table C-19
exclusively affect Environmental, Health and Safety). To address the health and safety issues in Table C19, many of the strategies in Table C-20 are geared towards CAP employees (e.g. strategies #64, #87, #88,
#91, and #92). Strategies geared towards CAP employees and how they conduct their work requires the
participation of Human Resources to help implement. As such, Environmental, Health and Safety has the
highest number of shared strategies with Human Resources (nine).

C.11

Human Resources

Human Resources is not very sensitive to climate change, with eight implications (third fewest of all
functions), but is very responsive to climate change, with 28 strategies (fourth most of all functions).
Implications and strategies associated with Human Resources are presented in Table C-21 and Table C-22
and are summarized below.

Appendix C-25

#43. Employee recruitment

#45. Difficulty collaborating due to

#53. Continuous adjusting to

Human Resources implications and strategies can be generally organized under three themes: staff
recruitment (implications #43 and #60), employee well-being (implications #41 and #42), and workforce
management (implications #45, #53, #55, and #57). These three themes have strong correlations with
several other functions; employee well-being can be linked to Environmental, Health and Safety, which is
strongly linked to Maintenance and maintenance staff that are more exposed to health and safety issues
by working in the field. Risk and Liability Management is also relevant to all three Human Resources
themes of implications and strategies. In fact, Human Resources has the highest number of shared
strategies with Environmental, Health and Safety (nine), and the highest number of shared implications
with Maintenance, Environmental, Health and Safety, and Risk and Liability Management (four).
Three implications uniquely affect Human Resources: employee recruitment challenges (implication #43),
increased staff retention (implication #57), and a larger talent pool (implication #60). Employee
recruitment challenges is a challenge implication that is driven by low population growth. Increased staff
retention and a larger talent pool are opportunity implications that are influenced by two different drivers.
Increased staff retention is a byproduct of weak economic health and growth; when the economy is weak,
fewer new jobs are available – causing more people to remain at their current places of employment. A
larger talent pool is directly associated with high population growth; the number of well-qualified local
candidates available for CAP to recruit also increases when the population of central Arizona grows.

Similar to the Human Resources implications in Table C-21, strategies that involve Human Resources also
fall under the three themes of staff recruitment (e.g. strategy #119), employee well-being (e.g. strategy
#88), and workforce management (e.g. strategy #13). All of the strategies associated with Human
Resources collectively address all of the Human Resources implications in Table C-21; however, there are
six Human Resources strategies that do not target any Human Resources implications (strategies #13, #48,
#74, #75, #106, and #118). Human Resources also has the highest adaptation capacity score amongst all
CAP functions (see Figure 8 in Section 4.6.1) due the large number of strategies that involve Human
Resources (28) as compared to the much smaller number of implications that affect Human Resources
(eight).
There are 12 strategies that are solely implemented by Human Resources, 10 of which address Human
Resources implications and two that address implications not pertinent to Human Resources. Nine of the
strategies that are unique to Human Resources (strategies #23, #94, #95, #96, #97, #122, #128, #129, and
#130) address at least one of the three implications that are also unique to Human Resources (implications
#43, #57, and #60). The two strategies that are solely implemented by Human Resources but do not target

Protective Services

Protective Services is both the least sensitive to climate change, with seven implications, and the least
responsive to climate change, with six strategies. Implications and strategies associated with Protective
Services are presented in Table C-23 and Table C-24 and are summarized below.

Protective Services has the lowest number of implications (seven) and adaptation strategies (six) out of all
the CAP functions discussed in this report. While having no opportunity implications, the challenge
implications that affect Protective Services are safety issues that are relevant to other CAP functions,
especially to Maintenance (thus none of the implications in Table C-23 are exclusively applicable to
Protective Services). Implications like more attempts at illegal canal diversions (implication #47), increased
encroachment on CAP lands (implication #48), and increased theft and vandalism (implication #49) may
require Protective Services to play a key role to resolve but these implications also impact how CAP field
staff perform their work on and along the canal. In fact, all of the Protective Services implications in Table
C-23 are shared with Maintenance.

Half of the strategies in Table C-24 can only be implemented by Protective Services: increasing CAP’s
security infrastructure (strategy #109), increasing patrolling and surveillance (strategy #110), and
continued cooperation with local authorities and law enforcement (strategy #111). These strategies help
to resolve some of the implications that would affect Protective Services the most; e.g. implications #47
and #49. Protective Services also shares the same number of strategies with all CAP functions (two),
excluding Information Technology, which shares one more strategy (three in total) than all other CAP
functions with Protective Services. This is because outside of strategies #3 (“Decrease level of service”)
and #99 (“Prioritize work activities”), which Protective Services shares with all other CAP functions, and
the strategies that can only be implemented by Protective Services (strategies #109, #110, and #111),
Protective Services shares one strategy solely with Information Technology (strategy #108). Strategy #108
leverages the participation of Information Technology to help Protective Services deploy drones for
remote monitoring and surveillance.
All of the strategies that involve Protective Services address implications that affect Protective Services,
with one exception: strategy #3 (decrease level of service). Of the seven implications that affect Protective
Services, three implications (implications #27, #41, and #42) are not addressed by Protective Services
strategies – these implications are addressed by strategies involving other functions such as
Environmental, Health and Safety and Human Resources.

C.13

Risk and Liability Management

Risk and Liability Management is moderately sensitive to climate change, with 14 implications (about
average for functions), and not very responsive to climate change, with seven strategies (tied for second
fewest of all functions). Implications and strategies associated with Risk and Liability Management are
presented in Table C-25 and Table C-26 and are summarized below.

Risk and Liability Management is a function that provides a service to CAP by identifying, analyzing, and
controlling risk at minimal cost. The implications that affect Risk and Liability Management in Table C-25
also affect other CAP functions and represent implications that pose risks with corresponding financial
costs. Human risks (e.g. more workplace accidents from implication #42), business operating risks (e.g.
low financial reserves from implication #7), and risks associated with infrastructure (e.g. land subsidence
near the canal from implication #26) all incur financial costs, either through insurance coverage or
preventative programs. In terms of its relation to other CAP functions, Risk and Liability Management has
the highest number of shared implications with Maintenance (11) and the highest number of shared
strategies with Water Operations and Power Programs (four).

Three of the adaptation strategies in Table C-26 fall under the complete jurisdiction of Risk and Liability
Management to implement: strategies #61 (“Analysis of criticality/vulnerability”), #89 (“Increase
insurance coverage”), and #93 (“Increase risk management”). Increasing CAP’s insurance coverage(s) and
increasing risk management analyses and practices helps to manage several very specific implications,
such as more occurrences of copper theft and property vandalism, and increased health and safety issues
due to higher temperatures and accidents resulting from extreme weather. In addition, due to Risk and
Liability Management’s focus on analyzing risk and vulnerability regardless of whether business operating
conditions are favorable or not, there are no opportunity implications for this function to capitalize on.
All of the strategies that involve Risk and Liability Management address implications that affect Risk and
Liability Management. Similarly, most of the implications that affect Risk and Liability Management are
addressed by Risk and Liability Management strategies. Three implications (implications #31, #47, and
#48) are not addressed by Risk and Liability Management strategies – these implications are addressed
by strategies involving other functions such as Protective Services and Water Operations and Power
Programs.

Legal

Legal is fairly sensitive to climate change, with 15 implications (about average of functions), and fairly

CAP’s Legal function assists other CAP functions by providing legal support for their respective needs or
by providing direct legal action on their behalf or on behalf CAP as a whole. In some cases, Legal provides
legal support in anticipation of direct legal action. The implications that affect Legal in Table C-27 reflect
this range of possible interaction for CAP’s Legal function. For example, difficulty seeking regulatory
solutions (implication #44) and increased lawsuits (implication #50) are implications that will require
direct action from Legal. Having to continuously adjust to a flexible regulatory environment (implication
#53) is a prime example of an implication that Legal can provide support on for other CAP functions.

Due to Legal’s capacity as a function that supports other CAP functions, none of the implications and
strategies in Tables C-27 and C-28, respectively, are exclusively applicable to Legal. Legal has the highest
number of shared implications (nine) and strategies (14) with Public Affairs. Most of the implications and
adaptation strategies that require Legal to provide legal support or action for are the same implications
and strategies that Public Affairs need to address for and with CAP’s stakeholders, legislative partners,
and the public.
The majority of Legal’s adaptation strategies are difficult to implement. What makes these particular
strategies difficult to implement is the cost component behind them and/or the legal and legislative
hurdles they must overcome to be successful. Difficult and costly Legal strategies include finding other
water supplies (strategy #9), looking at new water collection options (strategy #29), and increasing
conservation programs (strategy #31). Difficult and legally/legislatively-intensive strategies include
Appendix C-32

increasing CAP’s taxation authority (strategy #8), trying to renegotiate water rights (strategy #30), and
pursuing regulatory changes (strategy #81).
The majority of the strategies (12 out of 19) that involve Legal address implications that affect Legal.
Similarly, the majority of the implications (nine out of 15) that affect Legal are addressed by Legal
strategies.

Public Affairs

Public Affairs is very sensitive to climate change, with 19 implications (third most of all functions), and the

All but one of the implications that affect Public Affairs also affect other CAP functions (with Increased
pressure on legislature to enact solutions, implication #56, being the exception). However, the
implications in Table C-29 have legislative repercussions, and other consequences that can be of concern
to CAP stakeholders. Increased costs to CAP customers (implications #1, #2, and #3), increases or
decreases in the tax base (implications #6 and #19), and rate instability (implications #4 and #5) are
financial implications that CAP stakeholders and customers would find very important. Difficulties in
seeking legislative solutions (implication #44) and increased pressure on the legislature to enact solutions
(implication #56) are examples of implications with more direct legislative relevance. Furthermore, the
occurrence of these implications would necessitate CAP to inform their legislative partners, stakeholders,
and the general public about them. Hence, Public Affairs shares the highest number of implications with
Communications (14).

Public Affairs has the highest number of strategies (18) that are easy to implement amongst all CAP
functions (see Figure 7 in Section 4.6.1). Eight strategies from Table C-30 are primarily implemented by
Public Affairs: seek partnerships/federal grants (strategy #50), increase lobbying efforts (strategy #100),
increase meetings with between elected officials (strategy #101), hold stakeholder workshops (strategy
#103), encourage CAWCD Board outreach on behalf of CAP (strategy #105), collaborate with difficult
partners (strategy #120), explore long-term partnership projects (strategy #124), and work with
stakeholders on challenges (strategy #126). All of these eight strategies that are unique to Public Affairs
address implications from Table C-29. In terms of common strategies with other functions, Public Affairs
has the highest number of shared strategies with Legal (14).
Most of the strategies (30 out of 37) that involve Public Affairs address implications that affect Public
Affairs. Likewise, all but one of the implications that affect Public Affairs are addressed by Public Affairs
strategies. The one implication that affects Public Affairs but cannot be addressed by Public Affairs is an
opportunity: implication #19: increased tax base.

C.16

Communications

Communications is very sensitive to climate change, with 19 implications (third most of all functions), and
moderately responsive to climate change, with 16 strategies (just below the average for functions).
Implications and strategies associated with Communications are presented in Table C-31 and Table C-32
and are summarized below.

Appendix C-35

Table C-31: Implications that affect Communications
Challenge Implications
#1. Increased cost to customers –
supply driven.
#2. Increased cost to customers –
power driven.
#3. Increased cost to customers –
demand driven.

Opportunity Implications
#19. Increased tax base.
#58. Increased non-traditional
public/private partnerships.

Mixed Implications
#55. Cutbacks to other agencies
resulting in need for CAP to do
other’s work.

#59. Collaborative planning
environment.

#4. Reduced ability of customers to
pay rates.
#5. Rate instability.
#6. Decreased tax base.
#9. Reduction in deliveries to low
priority users.
#22. Degraded water quality –
weather driven.
#23. Degraded water quality –
supply driven.
#26. Land subsidence near canal.
#27. Potential damage to CAP
infrastructure and facilities, from
weather.
#28. Low elevations at Lake
Pleasant/Waddell Dam.
#46. More scrutiny placed on
planning.
#50. Increased lawsuits – contract
challenges.
#54. Ongoing need to manage
perceptions (public image).

Almost all of the implications in Table C-31 are mainly pertinent to other CAP functions; e.g. issues
associated with costs, rates, and the tax base (Financial Planning and Analysis), water delivery, storage,
and quality (Water Operations and Power Programs), and CAP infrastructure, facilities and equipment
(Maintenance). However, all of the major themes (revenue, water, and infrastructure) covered by these
implications represent topics that CAP needs to keep external and internal constituents informed on.
External constituents include CAP customers, legislative representatives, water and power agencies, and
the general public. Internal constituents are chiefly the CAWCD Board of directors, CAP leadership, and
CAP employees. One of the implications that is very germane to Communications is the ongoing need to
manage perceptions and CAP’s public image (implication #54).

Almost all of Communications’ adaptation strategies in Table C-32 are easy to implement strategies. The
exceptions are strategies #3 (“Decrease level of service”) and #35 (“Publish adaptive rate structure, use
Appendix C-37

ranges”), which are medium and difficult to implement, respectively. Four of Communications’ easy
strategies are primarily implemented by Communications. Half of these strategies that are primarily
implemented by Communications address implications that are connected to Communications (strategies
#4 and #51), while the other half address implications that do not affect Communications (strategies #49
and #79). Communications has the highest number of shared implications (14) and strategies (seven) with
Public Affairs.
Most of the strategies that involve Communications address implications that affect Communications,
with the exception of six strategies that target non-Communications implications. Similarly, most of the
implications that affect Communications are addressed by Communications strategies. Six implications
(implications #9, #19, #26, #54, #58, and #59) are not addressed by Communications strategies.
