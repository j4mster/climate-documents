SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Key Terms and Abbreviations
Key terms
Carbon sequestration: Carbon sequestration is
the process of capturing and storing atmospheric
carbon dioxide in soils, oceans, vegetation, and
geologic formations. It is one method of reducing
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
with the goal of reducing global climate change.

Community choice aggregation: Community
choice aggregation (CCA) allows local government
or another public entity to procure energy from
alternative utilities on behalf of residents and
businesses. This allows locals to choose from
multiple utility providers and provides the
opportunity to purchase exclusively renewable
energy if desired.
Cooling center: A cooling center is any public
location where people can get out of the sun, access
water, or be in a public air-conditioned space. Park
ramadas and libraries often provide these services
which are essential on hot days for those without
homes.
EV-ready parking spaces: EV-ready parking spaces
are those with the infrastructure and capacity
to handle the installation of an electric vehicle
charging station. Additionally, EV-ready spaces have
outlets compatible for personal charging.
Frontline communities: Frontline communities are
those that experience the consequences of climate
change first and most drastically. These are lowincome communities and communities of color whose
neighborhoods often lack basic infrastructure and
who will be increasingly vulnerable as our climate
deteriorates.

Green infrastructure: Green infrastructure is an
approach to water management that emphasizes
conservation and protects local watersheds by
filtering runoff.

Low-impact business: Those businesses which
can provide goods and services while minimizing
consumption of natural resources (water, energy,
plastics, etc.) are considered low-impact. Likewise,
low-impact businesses produce little waste or
pollution.
Resilience hub: Resilience hubs are spaces created
through the partnership of local government and
trusted community-based organizations (e.g.
recreation centers or faith-based institutions). They
provide services such as job training, childcare,
and community programming. Resilience hubs
also support crisis response through coordinating
communication and distributing resources such as
potable water, healthy food, and batteries.

Abbreviations
EVs

Electric vehicles are vehicles that derive
all or part of their power from electricity.

GHG

Greenhouse gases are heat-trapping
gases that warm the atmosphere such
as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous
oxide.

MTCO2e

Metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent is a common unit of
measurement for greenhouse gases
that includes consideration of major
greenhouse gases, including carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and
nitrous oxide (N2O).

VMT

Vehicle miles traveled is a metric used
in transportation planning to measure
the cumulative miles traveled by all
vehicles in a geographic region over a
given time period.

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Letter from the Mayor
The City of Sedona is committed to sustaining our community’s
striking landscape, small-town charm, and high quality of life.
In order to ensure that generations to come can enjoy the same
vibrant city we know today, we must respond to climate change
immediately and intentionally. The Sedona Climate Action Plan
(CAP) positions Sedona to be a leader by presenting a coordinated
strategy that holistically responds to the challenges of a changing
climate.
The people and businesses of Sedona are already experiencing the
threats of climate change firsthand. Recent events such as the 2016
monsoon flash flood and ongoing threats from wildfires exemplify
the risks the city faces from climate change. As temperatures
continue to rise globally, climate change is expected to introduce
even more disruption to our daily lives and to Sedona’s natural
landscapes. As a small, isolated community, it is imperative that the
Sedona community build resilience to these threats and do its part
to reduce climate-changing greenhouse gas emissions.
Although our community faces a momentous challenge, we also
have the opportunity to facilitate clean, efficient, and effective
solutions that reduce our exposure to the impacts of climate
change. At the same time, these solutions can bolster our local
economy and protect the health of our neighbors. Through proper
action, future generations of residents and visitors will be able to
enjoy Sedona’s natural beauty just as we do today.
The steps laid out in this plan are informed by Verde Valley climate
science data, an inventory of Sedona’s greenhouse gas emissions
sources, and input from local businesses and residents. These
actions have been carefully tailored and evaluated to bring tangible
and measurable benefits to the Sedona community and to ensure a
safe, healthy, and prosperous future for all.

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Land Acknowledgment
The City of Sedona acknowledges the original residents
of Sedona and the Verde Valley and their role as the
traditional stewards of the land on which this plan is set.
For centuries prior to the arrival of Euro-American settlers,
the Yavapai and Apache People lived with respect for the
land and with a light hand on the landscape.
The Apaches refer to this land as She Ke Yaa, our
homeland. The modern Yavapai-Apache Nation is the
amalgamation of two historically distinct tribes through
the Indian Reorganization Act (1934). Today, these groups
reside on several reservation parcels in the Upper Verde
Valley. The Yavapai refer to themselves as Wipuhk’a’bah
(the Red Rock People) and speak a Yuman language. The
Apache refer to themselves as Dil’zhe’e (the Hunters) and
speak an Athabaskan language.

This Climate Action Plan identifies the
necessity of building equity among all
residents of Sedona and the surrounding area
if we are to recognize our climate goals and
sustain life in this region. This includes learning
from and working with local indigenous
communities. Of particular importance is
our shared need to sustain flows in the Verde
River. The Yavapai-Apache Nation considers
the Verde to be both a source of and an
interconnected part of life. In 1937 tribal elder
Mary Sine said, “As long as the river flows, life
will be good.”

In 1871, the federal government established the 900
square mile Camp Verde Indian Reserve in the Upper
Verde Valley as a permanent refuge for tribal people.
The people were prospering. Then, without warning or
consent, in February of 1875, 1,700 Yavapai and Apache
prisoners of war were forcibly marched 180 miles to the
San Carlos agency east of Phoenix. The march resulted
in the loss of many lives and ultimately many traditions.
The Reserve was rescinded by a presidential executive
order in April 1875. The people began drifting back into
the Verde Valley after 1890 to find their homelands had
been occupied by newcomers. The original inhabitants
had been pushed to the fringes. The forced removal of
indigenous people from their lands is commemorated
annually as Exodus Day by the Yavapai-Apache Nation.
While the Yavapai-Apache Nation is the tribal government
with direct ties to these lands, the following tribes and
groups are also inextricably linked by common history to
the Upper Verde Valley.
The Tonto Apache Tribe of Payson
Yavapai Prescott Indian Tribe
Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation
The Hopi Tribe

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Vision and Goals
Our Vision: Sedona is a community
that nurtures connections between
people, encourages healthy and
active lifestyles, and supports a
diverse and prosperous economy,
with priority given to the protection
of the environment.
To realize this vision, this plan sets a goal to cut
Sedona’s greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by
2030. Reaching this target—which aligns with
the international scientific recommendation for
preventing the worst climate change impacts—will
require involvement and commitment from the
entire city. Local government, residents, businesses,
and community leaders must work together to bring
forth innovative and impactful solutions that work
for Sedona.

We Cannot Act Alone: Broader Policy and Technology Context
Addressing the enormity of the climate challenge will require action at all levels of government.
Sedona sits within the context of broader regional, state, and federal policy that influence our
community’s activities and GHG emissions. While many climate actions are within the purview of
local government—such as those related to land use, local transportation systems, and building
construction—others must be addressed at the state or federal level. Federal fuel economy
standards and state renewable energy portfolio standards are examples of broader policies that
affect local activities and emissions. Sedona must prioritize actions within its purview while also
advocating for and responding to relevant policy beyond its borders.
In addition to a changing policy landscape, Sedona’s future emissions will also be subject to
changing technologies and innovations. As low-carbon technologies improve, emissions may
be reduced in ways that are currently unforeseeable, allowing us to reach more ambitious climate
goals. This plan aims to leverage both existing and emerging technologies to achieve deep, longlasting climate and societal benefits.

Vision and Goals | 7

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

How it Came Together
Crafting a Climate Action Plan that truly reflects Sedona’s unique
community and priorities required help and input from across the
community. This plan reflects the culmination of a year-long process
that included technical assessments, consultation with local experts
and key stakeholders, and engagement and discussion with the broader
community.

Technical Advisory
Committee

Public
Workshops

A group of 13 volunteer
stakeholders convened at
multiple points in the process
to identify, refine, and evaluate
strategies for the plan.

The City hosted 5 public
workshops to present on the
CAP and engage in discussions
around priorities, concerns,
and ideas.

Public
Surveys

Internal City
Engagement

The City hosted 3 online public
surveys as a venue for hearing
the community’s thoughts,
gathering feedback, and
improving our approaches.

The City hosted 1 staff
workshop and conducted
ongoing engagement with
City staff across all City
departments.

Improvements

Heat and Wildfire
Risk

Renewable
Energy

Waste
Management

We heard a desire for
transportation-related
actions—including
bike/pedestrian
infrastructure, better
transit, low-carbon
transportation, and
reduced congestion.

Many residents are
concerned about
increased warming and
fire risk in Sedona—
highlighting public
health and safety
concerns.

We heard support for
renewable energy
actions to both reduce
climate pollution and
build a more resilient
power grid.

Locals want more
community education
and outreach related
to waste management
and desire expanded
recycling and
composting services
throughout the city.

flooding.

We heard support for
actions that address
tourism impacts and
tourism-related vehicle
emissions.

Constituents want to see
the City lead by example
with a green vehicle fleet
and visible renewable
energy projects.

There is concern about
how CAP actions could
increase the cost of living
in Sedona, and there is
a desire for rebates to
make the transition more
affordable.

How it Came Together | 9

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Climate Change in Sedona
Climate change is a global problem, but the impacts are felt locally. Sedona
is seeing increased flooding, more frequent and severe wildfires and smoke,
and rising temperatures that strain water resources. As global greenhouse
gas emissions continue to rise, these changes will increase over time and
continue to threaten our safety, natural resources, and economy.

A Two-Pronged Approach

Reduce GHG emissions
to limit additional
warming

MITIGATE
&
ADAPT

Climate mitigation is preventative

Mitigation measures reduce GHG emissions
to limit additional warming. These effects are
felt globally, and corresponding action should
be done in conjunction with local and federal
governments across the world. These measures
often also have localized co-benefits that can be
felt here in Sedona.

Prepare for and build
resilience to the impacts
of climate change

Climate adaptation is responsive

Adaptation measures prepare for and build
resilience to the impacts of climate change.
The effects of these measures are felt locally,
although they can also provide regional benefits
through stopping the spread of climate-related
disasters.

Climate Change in Sedona | 10

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

How Climate Change will Impact Sedona
Sedona and the Verde Valley are already experiencing climate
changes, and many of these changes are projected to worsen in
the future. Key changes include:
Hotter temperatures

More Extreme Heat

Warming brings
more summer heat
waves, wildfires, and
drought.

On average, the Verde
Valley experiences
8 days a year above
100°F. By 2100, that
number may rise to
75 days per year.

Heavier and more
frequent storms

Increased health
impacts

Extreme weather can
lead to more flooding
and high wind events.

Poor air quality,
extreme heat, and
dust storms can
create serious health
problems.

Agricultural impacts

Reduced Tourism

Excessive heat,
reduced water
resources, and
wildfires will threaten
common crops grown
in the Verde Valley.

More wildfire, smoke,
or extreme heat may
temporarily reduce
recreation and
tourism in summer,
spring, and fall.

Larger and Faster
Spreading Fires
Future wildfire
frequency is anticipated
to increase 25% in the
Southwest —leading
to increased health
impacts from smoke
and poor air quality.

Changing streamflows
Rising summer
temperatures and
increased seasonal
demands will strain
water availability.

Increased risk of
vector-borne diseases
Warmer temperatures
will create a more
welcoming environment
for vectors like
mosquitos that carry
West Nile Virus.

More information on anticipated climate changes
can be found in the Climate Profile for the Verde Valley.

How Climate Change will Impact Sedona | 11

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Benefits of Climate Action
Climate action will look different for each person, business, and group in
our community. While we all will need to make sacrifices for the greater
good, the benefits of climate action can also enhance our quality of life.

Boost our local economy
Investments in the construction, clean technology,
green infrastructure, and natural resource
management sectors provide businesses with
opportunities for growth and create skilled, wellpaying ‘green’ jobs for the community.
Improved bike and pedestrian access
can generate more visibility for local
shops and outlets—enhancing the
viability and financial sustainability
of small businesses.

Keep our skies clear and
landscapes beautiful
Taking climate action can enhance parks, green
spaces, and public amenities while providing other
services like carbon sequestration, shade, and wildlife
habitat.
Prioritizing native plants in parks and
other public properties can sequester
carbon, minimize water use, and
enhance habitat for native species.

Make us healthier

Save us money

Actions to mitigate climate change can benefit postpandemic life by prioritizing health and well-being,
cleaning our air, improving healthy food access, and
increasing safety.

Many climate actions reduce ongoing
maintenance and utility costs—providing
long-term cost savings and a positive return
on investment.

Transitioning to electric vehicles
reduces exposure and health impacts
from local air pollutants.

Switching to efficient equipment like
electric heat pumps reduces energy
use and costs.

Global Benefits
While there are many benefits and co-benefits of climate action that are felt
locally, emission reductions can also have a positive influence globally. Although
Sedona’s emissions are a small fraction of total global emissions, by doing our
part, we can encourage cities across the nation and world to do the same. As
a small, rural community with a global reputation and influence, we can be a
leader in demonstrating what is possible to other cities and towns.

Benefits of Climate Action | 12

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Emissions Sources
In 2018, we estimate that Sedona’s residents,
businesses, employees, and visitors produced over
165,800 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MTCO2e). Energy used to power and heat our
buildings (largely electricity and natural gas) make
up more than three-quarters (79%) of greenhouse
gas emissions. Energy used to power and move
our vehicles accounts for the bulk of the remaining
emissions in the city (18%).

<1%

TOTAL 2018 Emissions: 165,800 MTCO2e

What about consumption-based
emissions?
The emissions estimate above reflects many
of the primary and direct sources of GHG
emissions in the community. However, it
does not account for GHG emissions that we
indirectly produce through the purchase of
goods, services, or food produced in other
areas and transported to Sedona. While
these sources are much more difficult to
estimate at the local level, the City recognizes
the significant and important role these
“consumption-based” emissions play in
our overall carbon footprint. This plan
includes strategies and actions for lowering
emissions from our consumption, including
implementation of a municipal sustainable
procurement policy.

What about tourism-related emissions?
While our inventory captures the emissionrelated impacts of tourists once they arrive
in Sedona, it does not address emissions
associated with travel to Sedona.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions | 13

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

How We Get There
This plan is organized into the following sectors. Each sector presents our
strategies and actions for reducing climate pollution and fostering climate
resilience in Sedona.

facilities, and services are prepared for climate impacts,
especially those at the highest risk

How We Get There | 14

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

What will it take?
To achieve a 50% reduction by 2030, we will need to meet the outcomes below. The actions in the CAP
implementation matrix will get the community approximately halfway to our goal. The remaining 25%
reduction will rely on new and innovative technologies, additional federal and state action, and regular
reevaluation of Sedona’s progress.

How We Get There | 15

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Buildings & Energy
GOAL: Ensure long-term access to clean energy
while reducing the fiscal and environmental
impacts of consumption

Summary
Greenhouse gases are released during the
combustion of fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, and
natural gas—to heat, cool, and power buildings.
The generation, transmission, and distribution
of electricity and natural gas is the single largest
contributor to Sedona’s carbon footprint. State and
local action will be needed to transition to cleaner
energy sources.
The strategies and actions included in this section
will focus on an equitable transition to clean,
reliable, and affordable energy. Shifting our
building energy sources from fossil fuels to clean
electricity sources like wind and solar will be critical
in meeting our long-term goals. Making this shift
will require that we continue to reduce building
energy demand, introduce incentives for building
electrification, and expand renewable energy and
battery storage infrastructure.

Greenhouse gas emissions (2018)
131,828 MTCO2e
79% of total emissions
Co-benefit: Cost Savings
Reducing energy consumption saves on
energy bills. Solar is now less expensive than
other energy sources such as natural gas.

Sedona highlight
Sedona was
designated as a
SolSmart Bronze
community for its
efforts to make it
faster and easier to
switch to solar energy.

Strategies
Reduce building energy
demand

Shift to electric heating and
power in buildings

Maximize renewable energy
generation and storage
capacity

How We Get There | 16

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Transportation and Land Use
GOAL: Reduce transportation emissions and
enhance community mobility

Summary
The second largest source of greenhouse gas
emissions in Sedona is from the combustion of
fossil fuels in vehicles and equipment. Within the
transportation sector, the use of gasoline and
diesel passenger vehicles by residents and visitors
contribute the most to transportation emissions.
Strategies for these emissions focus on transitioning
to electric and other low-carbon fuels and
transitioning to alternative modes of travel such as
carpooling, public transit, biking, and walking.

Strategies
Develop and maintain a safe,
convenient, and effective
system for walking, biking,
and other active forms of
transportation

Greenhouse gas emissions (2018)
29,456 MTCO2e
18% of total emissions
Co-benefit: Equity
Expanding affordable transportation choices
can increase mobility and access for lowincome households.

Sedona highlight
The City recently installed 6 public EV
charging spots and purchased its first allelectric fleet vehicle.

Improve and increase transit
ridership

Increase fuel efficiency and
clean fuel use.

How We Get There | 17

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Materials and Consumption
GOAL: Increase the diversion of waste from the
landfill and reduce GHG emissions associated with
the consumption of goods and services

Summary
While the transport and disposal of solid waste
only contribute a small portion of Sedona’s carbon
footprint, the emissions associated with the
manufacture, transport, and use of those disposed
materials can be significant. Every phase of a
product’s life cycle—from origin, to production and
manufacturing, to transportation and distribution,
and ultimately to disposal—releases climate
pollution.
Strategies to reduce emissions from the
consumption of goods and services focus on
diverting waste from the landfill and encouraging
sustainable, climate-friendly consumption.

Greenhouse gas emissions (2018)
127 MTCO2e
<1% of total emissions
Co-benefit: Ecosystem Health
A city-wide composting program can improve
soil health and sequester carbon.

Sedona highlight
In 2019, the City’s
first Fix-it Clinic
repaired over 200 lbs
of household items—
fixing more than 80%
of items brought in.

Strategies
Enhance sustainable consumption to
minimize greenhouse gas emissions

Increase waste diversion

How We Get There | 18

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Water and Natural Systems
GOAL: Conserve community water resources by
maximizing water efficiency technologies while ensuring a
secure and sustainable water supply in the face of climate
change impacts. Manage, restore, and foster resilient
ecosystems, landscapes, and resources

Summary
Climate change paired with increased tourism
threaten the ability of Sedona’s natural
ecosystems to provide continued water, flooding
protection, wildfire resistance, and carbon
sequestration services. Although natural systems
are not formally captured in our greenhouse
gas inventory, proper management of these
systems can capture carbon while also enriching
recreational opportunities and improving habitat
health. Sustainable land management practices
like composting, climate-adaptive landscaping,
and intentional forest management have been
shown to increase the rate of carbon stored in
plants and soil.

Greenhouse gas emissions (2018)
3,435 MTCO2e
2% of total emissions
Co-benefit: Resilience
Green infrastructure and restoration can provide
protection from climate impacts such as flooding
and wildfires.

Sedona highlight
The City of Sedona participates on the Sustaining
Flows Council to partner with the Yavapai-Apache
Nation and other Verde Valley stakeholders to
ensure long-term water sustainability.

Along with preserving natural systems, actions in this section include tactics for expanding water reuse and
conservation. Although water management only contributes a small portion of our carbon footprint, actions
taken to minimize water use, optimize treatment, and improve overall water quality will ensure continued
provision of this important resource for future generations.

Strategies
Expand and improve
green spaces, including
increased ecosystem quality,
connectivity, and accessibility

Reduce water use

Expand water reuse and
improve water infrastructure

How We Get There | 19

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Climate Resilience
GOAL: Ensure Sedona and its residents, businesses,
visitors, facilities, and services are prepared for
climate impacts, especially those at the highest risk

Summary

Co-benefit: Economic Recovery

Making progress on climate change will require
leadership and commitment from city government
and the community. In addition to the sectorspecific strategies presented in this plan, broader
efforts to incorporate climate change considerations
across City and community activities will be
needed.
To ensure that climate action strategies meet the
needs of the community, this section includes
actions that integrate climate action throughout
Sedona. This includes considering climate change
in City processes and ensuring climate-related
investments target those in need. These actions
support education, capacity building, emissions
monitoring, and the reporting of climate actions.

Climate action supports local economic
prosperity through strategic investments,
new incentives, and expanded employment
opportunities.

Sedona highlight
In addition to the CAP,
the City finalized its first
Municipal Sustainability
Plan, which outlines
clear steps to addressing
sustainability and
resilience in City
operations.

Strategies
Increase community capacity
and awareness of climate
change risks and impacts

Adequately fund services for
disaster preparedness

Identify and target support for
at-risk populations

How We Get There | 20

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

Implementation
A plan is only as good as its implementation.
Achieving our climate goals will require dedication,
time, and resources from city government and
the broader Sedona community. Successful plan
implementation will require ongoing creativity
and adaptivity. It is essential that climate actions
respond to changes in technologies, state and
federal policies, community priorities, budgets,
grants, and other funding opportunities. We must
be strategic in how we sequence, execute, and fund
climate action to meet our targets in a manner that
brings the whole community along and maintains
our vision for a sustainable, prosperous future.

Phasing
Near-term (0-1 year)
Near-term implementation will focus on
establishing a foundation for meeting both
near-term and long-term goals. This initial
phase will involve key policy priorities,
education and outreach campaigns, and
voluntary incentive measures that address
top emission sources and climate risks.

Mid-term (2-4 years)

Funding
The City will utilize existing City resources, grants,
and other external funding sources to the extent
possible in implementing this plan. However, we
acknowledge that full implementation of the plan
will likely require new and creative funding sources.
Over the long term, it will be important to identify
funds that are guaranteed rather than dependent
on uncertain potential funding sources. Potential
funding sources include the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

City general fund
Bonds
Taxes, fees, and utility revenues
Federal and state grants
Private grants/investment and public-private
partnerships
Revolving loan funds
Local carbon offset funds

Many climate expenditures will not only reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, but will also bring
valuable environmental, social, and economic
benefits that can provide a positive net return on
investment.

Mid-term solutions address measures
needed to shorten the distance to meeting
our reduction target. This includes broader
regulatory requirements, expanded
infrastructure for long-term energy
transitions, and actions focused on lower
priority emission sources and climate risks.

Long-term (4+ years)
Long-term strategies are more
comprehensive solutions that require longterm investment, careful planning, and
broad coordination.

Implementation | 21

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

individual and municipal actions
The majority of strategies and actions outlined in
this plan are macro-level community actions. That
is, they focus on collective measures and regulatory
interventions that can help with mitigation and
adaptation efforts. It is critical, however, that
businesses, organizations, and individuals do
what they can to reduce their climate footprint as
well. This process will not be easy for everyone.
As a starting point, the following section on City
Leadership details how the City plans to incorporate
the consideration of climate change across all
activities and decision making. Additionally, we
have provided a list of individual actions that can be
taken by community members and their family.

Equity
Considering equity during plan implementation
goes beyond distributing resources equally.
Ensuring that participation in climate action is
accessible to the entire Sedona community will
require considering equity in policy, outreach, and
infrastructure development. City staff will work
to involve diverse community voices in all stages
of new initiatives and will track progress toward
advancing equity.
Although climate change is a global problem, its
effects are not felt equally. Communities with
less access to weatherization, transportation,
heating, cooling, and resilient infrastructure will
feel the impacts of climate change earlier and more
intensely than others. It is critical that Sedona
ensures these communities are included in the
design, outreach, and implementation of each
action in this plan.

Implementation | 22

SEDONA CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

City Leadership
Successful implementation will mean
that all parties—both within and
outside City government—have a clear
role in addressing climate change
through their work. It will also require
careful and ongoing progress tracking,
reporting, and adaptive management.
Key accountability and collaboration
approaches for implementation of the
Sedona CAP are summarized below.

Progress Reporting
Plan progress reports will be developed and
reviewed annually. GHG inventories will be
updated every year. Investing in data collection
and consistent reporting is a key aspect of
implementation and increases transparency.

Lead by Example
The success of this plan is contingent on the
Sedona City Council continuing to demonstrate
leadership on climate change. The Sedona City
Council will have the responsibility of oversight for
the plan. They will receive annual updates on CAP
progress and make policy decisions, budgetary
appropriations, and workplan approvals that will
facilitate implementation.

Plan Updates
The City will work with community partners to
update the CAP every three years. This three-year
update schedule will ensure that the plan can
respond to changing circumstances, market factors,
implementation challenges, and successes. This
process will include updating CAP goals, adjusting
indicators, and reprioritizing actions based on local
circumstances and new technology.

The actions laid out in this plan
directly tie into many of the goals
laid out in the City’s Municipal
Sustainability Plan. The City is taking
many actions internally to lead by
example.
Carbon Neutrality
By 2030, the City aims for
municipal operations to
be carbon neutral. While
much of this reduction
will require changing how
and what type of energy
the City consumes, some
reliance on carbon offsets
may be required.

Fleet Electrification
By 2030, the City strives
to transition all passenger
vehicles in the City fleet
to 100% zero emissions
vehicles.

Renewable Energy
By 2025, the City will
transition to consuming
100% renewable energy
for municipal operations.

What You Can Do
While many of the most pressing climate
actions will happen at the community
level, it is important to be cognizant of
our individual emissions and behaviors
as well. While there are many steps you
can take to reduce your own footprint,
here are some idea of how to get started.

Materials and Consumption
Reduce your meat and dairy
consumption. Eating more plantbased foods, such as fruits, grains,
and vegetables is one of the most
impactful actions you can take.

Buildings and Energy
Commit to solar. Visit
www.Sedonaaz.gov/solar to
learn about the process for
installing solar on your home
or business. Incentives and
resources are available to assist
with this transition.

Transportation
and Land Use
If you drive to work, consider
carpooling, biking or taking the
bus one or more days per week,
or telecommuting if possible. If
that’s not possible, consider an
electric vehicle next time you are
purchasing a car.

Water and Natural Systems
Create a native and droughttolerant backyard. Attend a Native
Plant Workshops to help learn
about how to add native plants
into your landscape. Careful
landscape planning can also
reduce your home’s wildfire risk.

Climate Resilience
Talk with family, friends, and
neighbors about climate concerns,
priorities, and needs. According
to the Yale Program on Climate
Change Communications,
although 63% of Americans are
worried about global warming,
only 35% of Americans discuss it.
By having open conversations, you
can help prepare your community
for the effects of climate change.
