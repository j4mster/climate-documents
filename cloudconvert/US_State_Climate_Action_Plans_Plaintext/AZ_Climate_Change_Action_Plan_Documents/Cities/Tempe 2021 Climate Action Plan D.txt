Letter from the Mayor
My fellow Tempe community members,
Climate change and the extreme heat our region faces present
a critical opportunity for our community to come together.
Tempe is a world-class city – some say we are Making Waves in
the Desert – and I am proud to see all of our climate commitment
and progress.
What’s amazing is that the work of creating a more livable,
resilient community is being championed by local businesses,
young people, and neighborhoods with the support of city
elected officials and staff members. We are all pulling together
and that is just what we will need to keep creating the best future
for Tempe.
In these pages, you can read about this new approach and the
milestones we are committed to reaching in our journey. We
actively seek and truly listen to community voices – they are here.
And we have pinpointed the local, state and federal resources
and partnerships that support our goals.
Youth: Middle school, high school, and college students are leading a passionate call for change and deeper
investment in climate action. You will hear their voices in this document. For example, they want the city
to expand climate action to include transportation equity, food access, and more changes in their schools.
Adults must listen and respond.
Businesses: Tempe Chamber of Commerce, Local First Arizona, Downtown Tempe Authority, and businesses
of all sizes across Tempe are making change happen. Opportunities for partnerships and program expansion
are rich. Tempe businesses can be shining lights for social responsibility, energy cost savings, and climate
action.
Climate Justice: Equal access to transportation, good jobs, affordable housing, and parks should be
viewed as fundamental rights. Climate and social justice issues include addressing the racial and economic
disparities of who has access to a shaded bus stop, a tree-lined cool street, an air-conditioned solar-powered
home, and a dignified job. Our advocacy community speaks clearly that government needs to address racial
and economic disparities.
Neighborhoods: Resident’s love living in Tempe and they want to continue to stay – comfortably – for
generations. We are hearing from neighbors that there is a need to double down on our efforts to address
extreme heat and urban forestry. We see the amazing work that neighborhoods are doing to green their
streets and schools. There are many exciting opportunities to support increased shade, walkability, and
residents’ connections to each other.
Grants: I am proud of our Sustainability and Resilience Office’s work to bring more than $2.5 million in grants to
Tempe so far. These grants expand what we can do by bringing new ideas, ways of working, and talent into our
climate work. From centering BIPOC voices to youth-led climate action, to developing governance models for
resilience to extreme heat, and to bringing climate-sensitive urban forestry to our streets and schools. Grants
play a critical role in expanding how local government supports the climate movement in Tempe.
Partnerships: No significant advances in climate action can be made alone. Our research collaborations with
Arizona State University, business partnerships and connections to local, regional, national, and international
organizations allow Tempe to expand and improve our approach to transforming our city.

Letter from the Mayor
Investments: Tempe has a long history of using local, state, and federal resources to build a multi-modal
city with biking, walking, Orbit, buses, light rail, and Tempe Streetcar. That commitment to deep investment
and multiple funding streams can also apply to housing, urban forestry, clean energy, human services, and
community resilience. We will remain diligent in creating regional, state, and federal funding streams that can
be paired with Tempe’s investment to increase impact and scale.
Walking the Talk: Tempe will not ask residents and partners to invest in new technologies and approaches
if we do not do so ourselves. We are committed to becoming carbon-neutral city operation by 2050 with
a 100% renewable energy strategy by 2035. I am so proud of our Municipal Utilities, Engineering and
Transportation, Community Development, Community Services, Human Services, Finance, Human Resources,
and Information Technology Departments for embracing these efforts and providing examples that inspire
and motivate our residents and businesses.
Mayor and Council: I sincerely appreciate the hard work of my City Council colleagues in creating a more
livable, sustainable and resilient city. Councilmembers Jennifer Adams and Lauren Kuby are working
on policy and programs to support our climate work. Vice Mayor Randy Keating and Councilmember
Robin Arredondo-Savage are leading the way in ensuring we are growing our economy and developing
partnerships to help businesses across the city. Councilmembers Doreen Garlid and Joel Navarro are
rethinking our approach to public safety and our parks and recreation investments.
Regional Collaboration: We all share air, water, energy, and transportation systems, so impactful change
cannot happen in silos. Since our first Climate Action Plan, of the cities of Phoenix and Mesa now have
climate plans, and regional collaboration is gaining momentum. We need to ensure a regional approach to
growing sustainable transportation, expanding the clean energy economy and creating a cool and connected
Maricopa County for all.
Livable and Sustainable Tempe for All: I appreciate your interest in exploring this thought-provoking plan.
You will find inspiring voices, a solid set of potential investments, pathways for increased climate leadership,
and plenty of opportunities for collaboration. We can do this. We can invest in the future. And we can do it
together.
Sincerely,

Corey D. Woods
Mayor

Commission Letter
Hello neighbor,
We are the chair and vice chair of the Sustainability and
Resilience Commission. We are a city commission made up
of residents, experts, businesses, and advocates that guide
and recommend climate action policy to your Mayor and
Council. We are thrilled to be a part of the Climate Action
Plan Update. The Commission has advised staff, attended
meetings and briefed elected officials. The Commission
worked with the Sustainability and Resilience Office,
Unlimited Potential, Tempe Chamber of Commerce, Local
First Arizona, Downtown Tempe Authority, Tempe students,
Arizona State University, and residents like you on this
update.
When we co-created the first plan with Mayor and Council,
it was important to us to use five Tempe values as guiding
principles to shape the update:
Equity - Race, income and background should not determine a resident’s access to clean energy, shade,
transportation or housing. We need to support initiatives that address inequality;
Engagement - The city must move away from just informing, to creating co-ownership that allows residents,
youth, and businesses to be true parts in change;
Evidence - Data and best practices can ensure we use resources wisely and have impact;
Enterprise - local businesses are part of Tempe’s soul and critical partners in building solutions;
Fiscal responsibility - we have limited funds to address climate change and we must be stewards of
public funds.
Our Commission worked over the past six years to enhance and secure Tempe’s Sustainability and Resilience
program and its climate action approach. We are excited to continue this work in Tempe. But we want to be
very clear; the actions taken so far are inadequate. Moving forward we need to:
Be more urgent - the science is clear, the window to take climate action this decade is critical;
Welcome transformation - we need to move beyond destructive fossil fuels and fully embrace the clean
energy and transportation economy;
Increase funding - Tempe is a climate leader in Arizona, but that means nothing without deep city, regional,
state and federal investments in our buildings, homes, schools and businesses;
Collaborate more - “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”
We need to encourage our Mayor and Council to make a deep financial investment in emissions reduction
and resilience efforts. We have a responsibility to our friends, family, to our children and our children’s
children to take bold, decisive action today. The Sustainability and Resilience Commission believes this
update to the Climate Action Plan is the next step towards a healthier and more resilient future for
generations to come.
And we are proud that this plan centers the voices of Tempe residents and businesses at its heart, and we
look forward to the investments in action and collaboration that you will make this year. We thank you for
working together on this update and continuing to step up to do the big things needed to make Tempe a
better and healthier city.

Resilience
Tempe has made strides to become more resilient to extreme heat, but our actions are not currently
preparing the city for the extreme heat our city will face in the decades to come. Our lack of investment in
shade and cooling follows racial and poverty, meaning that we need to have a comprehensive approach to
equitable cooling in Tempe.

Climate Action Plan I 4

Introduction
The 2022 Climate Action Plan Update builds upon the original plan and provides updated data on Tempe’s
efforts to lower Greenhouse Gas emissions and become more resilient to extreme heat.
The City of Tempe has two adopted performance measures that guide this plan:
Community Carbon Neutrality: Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions for residents,
businesses, and industry by 2050.
Municipal Carbon Neutrality: Zero Greenhouse Gas Emissions in city operations by
2050 with a strategy of 100% renewable energy by 2035.

What is global climate change?
Global climate change refers to increasing global temperatures, which cause changes in our regular weather
patterns. Global climate change is caused by human activity: it is due to Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions
being released into the Earth’s atmosphere as by-products of burning fossil fuels used for producing energy
and transportation. These GHGs include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx),
and methane (CH4).
The increasing GHG emissions created by human activity (namely energy and transportation) intensify
the greenhouse effect. This natural process heats our Earth and allows it to be habitable. However, large
amounts of GHG emissions block the solar radiation trying to escape our atmosphere. This leads to increased
temperatures and irregular weather patterns, which are dangerous to health and affect the quality of life.

Introduction
How does global climate change affect Tempe?
Global climate change is already causing Tempe to see hotter days than in previous years. A second,
different local climate change process is causing hotter nights because the daytime heat is stored in our built
environments and released during the night. This process is called the urban heat island effect (UHI).
Local urban heat islands warm Tempe, but urban heat islands’ impact on Tempeans is not experienced evenly
throughout the community. Neighborhoods surrounded by wide roads, parking lots, and buildings with low
vegetation cover and tree canopy can have up to 13oF warmer air temperatures than neighborhoods with
more trees and less pavement and buildings. Combined, these increases in temperatures can dangerously
affect Tempeans’ everyday lives and some more than others. By taking action, Tempe can mitigate the
severity of these combined climate impacts by building resilience against extreme heat and reducing
dependence on fossil-fuel-based energy and gasoline-powered transportation.

Purpose of a Climate Action Plan
Tempe’s 2019 Climate Action Plan (CAP) serves as a guideline for the City of Tempe in its planning and
decision-making concerning Greenhouse Gas emissions reduction and resilience. The CAP focuses on
measuring and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing the City’s ability to cope with
extreme heat. The CAP proposes investments (policies, programs and infrastructure) that the City of Tempe
can make to support climate action.

Introduction
Purpose of 2022 Climate Action Plan Update
This is not a new Climate Action Plan but an update of the 2019 Climate Action Plan. The 2022 CAP Update
continues to build on the actions and solutions presented in the 2019 CAP, and it provides new data, four
stakeholder agendas, and updated investments and funding proposals. The update includes the voices and
perspectives of Tempe residents and businesses in order to develop a set of investments that reflects the
Tempe community. The 2022 CAP Update is guided by five principles put forward by the Sustainability and
Resilience Commission: fiscal responsibility, enterprise, equity, engagement, and evidence.

Introduction
Resilience to Extreme Heat Update
Tempe is experiencing hotter temperatures earlier in the spring, later in the
Fall, and for more extended periods. Summer 2020 (June-August) set the
record for the most number of days above 110oF (53), hottest month on record
(August average 99.1oF), and hottest summer on record (average 96.6oF).
Extreme heat can disrupt our daily lives and jeopardize our health, but not
everyone suffers equally. Urbanization intensifies these disruptions because
it contributes to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, which traps heat in
pavements and buildings, amplifying already high temperatures. Where
UHIs are located is highly correlated with income, race, and other social
factors.
The resilience to extreme actions recommended in the 2019 Climate Action Plan attempt to design and
build infrastructure (roads, bridges, parks, and buildings) and programs (Emergency management and
urban forestry) that reduce the impact of UHI and global climate change. The green codes and standards
highlight actions in the 2019 CAP (green stormwater infrastructure and green construction codes) need to
be fully implemented to support urban cooling and additional efforts need to be made to equitable cool
neighborhoods that are most impacted by heat.

The number of days over 110°F has risen each decade and continues to increase. By the mid-21st Century, in the summer of 2020s,
53 days over 110°F will be the average. Information like this can help us apply cooling strategies to reduce the present and future
impact of excessive sunlight and heat on our neighborhoods and communities.

Introduction
Heat Vulnerability
Urban heat islands can result in neighborhood vulnerability because some Tempeans are impacted more
than others by heat. Tempe must build resilience against present and future threats that produce uneven
adverse health, environmental, and economic impacts caused by extreme heat. The first step is to document
existing heat vulnerabilities. It’s not enough to find only the hot spots. We must look at who is suffering from
heat the most and combine that with where it is hottest.
Heat Vulnerability means some residents and households are more exposed + sensitive to heat during their:
• daily routines inside homes and places
• commutes between places
• outdoor activities

Introduction
Equitable Cooling
The city-university partnership between the City of Tempe and Arizona State University (ASU) is codeveloping a new approach to implementing resilience to extreme heat. ASU technical experts have
collected and analyzed new data that documents how extreme heat affects Tempe on three scales and how
the City can create “equitable” urban cooling.
City-scale: heat is measured by taking the temperatures of
surfaces, like streets, park areas, etc. Maps show how hot each
census tract is. This heat data can now be combined with other
data available by census tracts, like age, race and income.
Together, this informs the City of Tempe where to place future
infrastructure to generate cooling for those most exposed to heat.
• Infrastructure placement
• Cooling Center placement
• Cool corridor placement
• Land use
Neighborhood-scale: heat is measured by Mean Radiant
Temperature (MRT); this is the temperature that people feel
because they experience the heat that surrounds them as it
radiates from the sun, from the ground up, and from the buildings
around them. This MRT data helps identify the hot places (like
unshaded parking lots) and cool places (like a shaded park) within
a neighborhood. This informs the City of Tempe how to connect
cool places with each other, using infrastructure to create “cool
corridors.”
• Park design
• Street design
• Transit shelter design
• Green buildings
Touch-scale: heat is measured by taking the temperature of the
materials that people touch, such as when children play on jungle
gyms or people sit on a bench. This informs the City of Tempe on
how to specifically design infrastructures to offer the most cooling
in a particular place. For instance, the city can select materials that
don’t burn skin as quickly (e.g., wood can get much hotter until it
burns skin than metal) and place shade strategically to add further
cooling.
• Street furniture selection
• Playground equipment selection
• Building material selection
Deciding where to place infrastructure and programs, how to connect them, and how to design
infrastructure on the touch scale is done with people’s lived experience in mind and with a focus on
equity. This analysis resulted in a deeper understanding of the where investment is needed most to
alleviate individuals’ vulnerability to extreme heat. Embedding this approach across city departments
and into planning and design will support equitable urban cooling in Tempe.

Introduction
Racial Equity and Climate Justice
During the planning of the 2019 CAP residents requested more interactive engagement and a stronger
focus on equity and climate justice. In response to that feedback, The Sustainability and Resilience Office
played an active role in the Equity in Action (EiA) program with the Neighborhoods Services Department
and the Strategic Management and Diversity Office. The EIA program, supported by a team of City of Tempe
employees from many departments, recruited a diverse coalition of residents and advocates across Tempe.
With the support of local racial equity consultants, the coalition developed a framework that supports the
City of Tempe in increasing the participation of underrepresented and historically marginalized community
members, including black and indigenous residents and people of color (BIPOC) in government planning and
decision-making.
Equity in Climate Actioning Planning
In the Summer of 2020, The Sustainability and Resilience Office held a listening session with EiA members
and residents that care about environmental justice. The residents urged the City of Tempe to fully
acknowledge the connection between climate change and racial equity. The data in Tempe and the Phoenix
region clearly shows that residents of color are harmed by extreme heat more than white residents.
Addressing extreme heat and climate change means that racial inequality and structural racism must
be addressed. The listening session participants recommended that the City support a Climate Justice
Agenda that is co-created with a community-based organization with existing relationships and trust within
communities of color.
Climate Justice Agenda
The City of Tempe partnered with Unlimited Potential, a local non-profit, to identify climate change
issues affecting marginalized communities in Tempe. These issues make up Tempe’s first-ever Climate
Justice agenda. This partnership helps the City create awareness and address areas of priority such as
transportation, energy, resiliency, affordable housing, and food access, specifically in the neighborhoods that
are exposed to extreme heat. Unlimited Potential strives to center indigenous voices in Tempe and highlights
the importance of collaboration with local tribes and tribal members on land stewardship. Furthermore,
Unlimited Potential conducted all of their engagements in English and Spanish in order to reach residents
that do not traditionally engage in City of Tempe public outreach events.
The Climate Justice Agenda reflects one attempt to diversify the residents that have a say in city decision
making. One of the key takeaways from the community-led work, is that intersectionality matters. Thinking
in silos allows injustice and inequality to continue. Decisions made across the City of Tempe can affect how
residents survive and thrive during climate change. Policing policy, affordable housing programs, parks
infrastructure, road design all play a role in how residents of color experience Tempe. When a climate shock
like a heatwave happens, decisions in different areas of the City from years before can have a lasting impact
on what resources or infrastructure is available in a particular place. Climate justice and preparing for a future
with extreme climate change require paying attention to connections, history, and how we support residents
who have previously been left out of design processes and decision-making. The Climate Justice Agenda and
the integration of equity into 2022 CAP Update are one attempt at a more inclusive policy making process.
There is a need to continuously work on who is involved in public engagement and what priorities are made
in investing in the future of the city.

Introduction
2022 CAP Update Engagement
In the 2022 CAP Update improves upon the 2019 CAP to better reflect the voices and needs of residents and
businesses.
Four agendas were created to express the views and ideas of Tempe residents and businesses: Youth,
Neighborhood, Climate Justice, and Business. Each stakeholder group was asked to identify the actions and
partnerships need to advance climate action in Tempe. The agendas were created through the following
process:
Listening Sessions: The Sustainability and Resilience Office hosted six listening sessions in the Summer of
2020 to learn from residents and businesses about what they wanted out of the 2022 CAP Update process.
The listening sessions focused on youth, equity, design professionals, neighborhoods, business, and the faithbased community. In the Spring of 2021, ASU students in a course called “Equity in Climate Action” hosted
two listening sessions inviting community members from the Neighborhood and Youth stakeholder groups.
The course was co-taught by Dr. Lauren Withycombe-Keeler and Dr. Marta Berbés. The purpose of the
listening sessions was to hear about people’s lived experiences and visions for climate action in Tempe. The
listening sessions informed the tools, forums, and agenda development implemented during the rest of the
update process.
Imagining Tempe in 2035 through stories: The Climate Stories project features two stories set in 2035.
The stories were placed on posters throughout Tempe and led participants to see how communities might
respond to extreme heat in the future. After reading the stories, participants were given the opportunity to
respond to a survey on what they felt Tempe could do to combat climate change and make Tempe more
resilient. They voiced problems that Tempeans face, solutions the City of Tempe can implement, and the
community actions the City of Tempe can support. This project offered a novel engagement strategy to
engage the public in future initiatives. The authors note that participants in their process envisioned:
“A Tempe where the City is doing its best in combating climate
change and making the City more resilient. More shade structures,
sustainable farming, and solar energy were emphasized. But most
importantly, it was envisioned that the City of Tempe would be more
compassionate, collaborative, and cohesive.”
Partnerships:
Partnerships were developed to co-create the four agendas:
• Tempe Chamber of Commerce (Business Agenda)
• Local First Arizona (Business Agenda)
• Unlimited Potential (Climate Justice Agenda)
• Arizona State University (Neighborhood Agenda)
• Mayor’s Youth Advisory Commission (Youth Agenda)
Public Forums: Each agenda had public forums over the Summer
and Fall of 2021. Local First Arizona and the Tempe Chamber held
two panels to create the business agenda. The Sustainability and
Resilience Office hosted neighborhood and youth forums. Unlimited
Potential held a series of workshops and an evening event in
Escalante Park to inform the Climate Justice Agenda.

Highlight Action Update
In 2019 the Sustainability Commission recommended four climate actions that the City should focus
on to develop early wins and a culture of transformation. The following update shows what has been
accomplished so far. The update uses examples from cities around the country and world to demonstrate
how Tempe can lead in green buildings, green stormwater infrastructure, resilience hubs (including
resilient energy hubs), and transportation demand management (including mobility hubs).

Green Codes and Standards (GSI and IgCC Adoption)
Tempe is pursuing Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) and green codes like the International Green
Construction Code (IgCC) to combat extreme heat. Extreme heat affects public health, air and water quality,
vegetation, and more.
GSI is an approach to water management that aims to save money, save water, and keep Tempe cool
by working with nature to reduce stormwater runoff. Tempe’s GSI objective is to create a citywide plan
(including identified infrastructure investments) with permanent funding for its operations and management.
The IgCC is a code that helps cool Tempe by guiding developers to make their buildings sustainable, resilient,
and high performing. The goal for IgCC is to have a regional green building code that supports sustainability
and urban cooling that is tailored to the desert Southwest.

Tempe’s Progress
Through piloting green buildings on city property and considering a sustainable building policy for City
buildings, Tempe is at the early stages of a long-term green building strategy.
Policy
- Considering City Sustainable Building Policy (IgCC)
Programs
- Funded full time employee in Community Development to begin program (IgCC)
Infrastructure
- Small pilot projects at Rio Salado and Hardy, EVBOM and Apache and Dorsey, 12th and Mill (GSI)
- LEED-certified city buildings (IgCC)

Highlight Action Update
Transportation Demand Management and Mobility Hubs
Tempe has upgraded its transportation sector by improving light rail, bike, pedestrian, and streetcar
infrastructure. These changes reduce the use of single-occupancy vehicles and emissions, increase safety, and
help make Tempe a 20-minute city.
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) provides alternative transportation options. A Transportation
Management Association (TMA) is a public-private partnership that aims to reduce traffic congestion and
carbon emissions.
Mobility Hubs (a TDM strategy) are sites that combine different modes of transportation in one location,
helping reduce the need for vehicle ownership and single occupancy trips. Investment in mobility hubs will
make trips safer, convenient, and more reliable. The goal for mobility hubs is to have policy and funding that
supports a regional network of hubs that allow for safe and convenient low-carbon transportation.

Tempe’s Progress
Through planning for mobility hubs and starting a Transportation Management Association (TMA),
Tempe is advancing its approach to Transportation Demand Management.

Agendas
Residents and businesses are advancing the climate movement in Tempe. The following agendas are the
actions, partnerships and recommendations created by our youth, neighborhoods, climate justice, and
business community.

Youth Agenda
Tempe youth have advocated for climate action for years and have the ideas and perspectives necessary
to move climate action forward in the City of Tempe. A virtual forum hosted by the City of Tempe’s
Sustainability Office in June 2021, provided an opportunity for Tempe youth and students to engage with
several topics that were highlighted as important in previous youth engagements. This included food access,
equity, partnerships with school boards and leaders, and taking action on Green Stormwater Infrastructure. In
attendance were Tempe High School students, recent college graduates, and engaged community members
who work with Tempe Youth.

Students plant native vegetation at McClintock High School.

Actions
Equity
Youth demand that the City of Tempe do more to address equity and climate justice. While equity was
mentioned in Tempe’s previous Climate Action Plan, it was not a central focus.
Young people in Tempe echo the ideas and plans put forward in the Climate Justice Agenda. The support for
climate justice across communities makes clear the importance of these issues to Tempeans.
In order to more seriously focus on equity, Youth believe the City must:
• Ensure easier access to healthy food for residents of all income levels
• Remove/decrease the taxes on produce and other “healthy” foods
• Increase overall accessibility for people with physical and mental disabilities
• Implement free or affordable transportation options
• Provide free or affordable food and water options at transit centers and bus stops
• Increase tree canopy and overall shade availability in Tempe, especially at transportation centers

Food
Tempe Youth believe that there is an opportunity to improve
food access and food entrepreneurship options in the city, while
increasing green space, mitigating heat, and building community.
Youth see food as one of the major program actions Tempe can
focus on today and in the future, especially in how food access
impacts youth, students, and vulnerable communities directly.
Tempe currently has a number of programs and services
targeted at increasing food access such as:
• Food Banks
• The Farm Express Bus
• Existing School Garden Initiatives
• Urban Agriculture and Community Gardens
• Farmers Markets
• Food Entrepreneurship Pilot Projects
Youths volunteer at Escalante Community Garden.

Youth believe that Tempe can increase the focus on food access through creating programs such as:
• Installing composting/Vermiculture at schools
• Creating educational cooking programs that utilize wasted food (“Pickle Day”)
• Implementing gardens at public schools subsidized by the City of Tempe
• Reducing or eliminating the cost of food in schools and communities
Youth ask that the City of Tempe create a plan and oversight committee to:
• Expand school gardens
• Empower youth and students interested in food entrepreneurship opportunities
• Invest in the local food economy
• Create affordable food access hubs at Tempe schools and community centers

Green Codes and Standards - Green Stormwater Infrastructure
Tempe youth were inspired by Green Stormwater Infrastructure
(GSI) work in Austin, Texas and believe that the city and local school
districts can make similar investments.

Best Practice: Reilly Elementary School, Austin, Texas

GSI ensures that cities and developers consider stormwater and
urban cooling when creating the landscape of developments, parks,
schools and more. In 2020, Reilly Elementary School in Austin, Texas
celebrated the opening of its rain catching landscape.

Reilly Elementary School students examine Green
Stormwater Infrastructure site plan.

Some benefits seen by Reilly Elementary School after implementing
Green Stormwater Infrastructure include:
• Beautification of the campus with flowering native plants and
lush grasses
• Opportunities for outdoor and hands-on education through
partnership with a local Community-Based Organization,
Partners for Education, Agriculture, and Sustainability (PEAS)

• Collaboration between surrounding neighborhoods, the City, and the school
• Environmental protection including improving water quality in the nearby watershed and reducing erosion
Raising awareness about how Green Stormwater Infrastructure can help other communities throughout the
City of Austin
Just like the City of Austin has benefited from Green Stormwater Infrastructure being implemented at Reilly
Elementary School, Tempeans can also benefit from schools implementing similar features on their campuses!
Students believe their schools can benefit from Green Stormwater Infrastructure implementation by increasing
the number of native plants on their school grounds and promoting the implementation of greywater systems
in their school facilities.

implementing sustainable practices into their business operations.
Over the Summer of 2021, the City of Tempe’s Office of Sustainability and Resilience, in partnership with the
Tempe Chamber of Commerce and Local First Arizona’s sustainability team, hosted two virtual forums for
Tempe business leaders that resulted in the following actions.

Actions
Energy Efficiency

Energy efficient lighting at a Tempe small business.

In Arizona, a large percent of power comes from nonrenewable
resources. Greenhouse gas emissions from these resources can cause
detrimental problems such as poor air quality, temperature increases,
urban heat island effect, and health complications. Businesses can
work with their energy utility to save money, increase their energy
efficiency, grow Arizona’s clean energy economy, and become more
sustainable and resilient to future disruptions.
Energy, SRP or APS, Utility Programs for Businesses
• Standard rebate programs: Replace units with energy efficient
ones - lighting, refrigeration, HVAC controls, thermostats, building
envelope, and appliances.
• Custom rebate programs: Relates to unique projects, items, and
industrial processes. Fit to facility’s needs.
• Retrocommissioning programs: Reprogramming control systems
and bringing a building back into its original design state (increase
efficiency, fix wear and tear, preserve existing building stock).

Energy Cost Saving Actions for Businesses
• Find the problem and start measuring: Post utility bills and track usage; empower employees to
participate; have an energy audit performed.
• Prevent future problems: Maintain and clean equipment; rearrange for common-sense layouts ie.
refrigerator away from oven; proper ventilation; increase awareness and education among staff.
• Make a plan to right size your business with efficiency: Replace fluorescent and incandescent lights
with LEDs, CFL, or daylighting; phase out old equipment and appliances with options that are “smart” or
Energy-star related; seal building envelopes and replace inefficient windows and doors.

Highlight Action
Mobility Hubs
Tempe businesses are excited that there is a business that sees investment in mobility hubs as central to their
economic model.
Mobility hubs are infrastructure solutions that provide
transportation options to bring workers and residents to business
locations in Tempe, while supporting clean transportation. One
example of a mobility hub being implemented in Tempe is Culdesac,
the first car-free neighborhood in the United States. Culdesac is
currently in development on a 17-acre lot in the city. The area will
be made up of residential and retail space, co-working space, and
an outdoor pedestrian area - all car free. Utilizing the mobility hub
concept allows Culdesac to do just that by providing a variety of
transportation solutions such as e-bikes, e-scooters, rideshare, bike
parking, and on-site light rail.

Climate Justice Agenda

Councilwoman Doreen Garlid discusses a climate justice issue at an EnVision Tempe event.

The Office of Sustainability hired community-based organization, Unlimited Potential, to connect with
vulnerable residents of target neighborhoods most affected by climate change. A series of engagement
sessions were held to discuss energy equity and extreme heat, community health and resilience, and the
EnVision Tempe center. Tempe residents assisted in building a climate action plan that addressed the
inequitable and unjust effects of climate change.

Actions
Extreme Heat and Energy Equity
Residents want to live comfortably in a cool, walkable Tempe with
adequate living standards that conserve energy. Unfortunately,
some disadvantaged residents have to choose between paying for
electricity and other necessities because the cost of cooling their
homes is too expensive. Unsheltered residents, who use the least
energy, are the most at risk from extreme heat.
The overall health and well-being of Tempe residents can improve
with the following processes and policies:
• Unsheltered Population: support and respect unsheltered persons
• Neighborhood Funding: mobilize neighborhoods as a collective energy
action
• Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI): promote water conservation and
increase native vegetation
• Energy Savings: set an allotted amount of energy at no cost; lower-		
income residents would benefit the most
• Property Renovations: weatherize and update existing living spaces
• Energy Efficiency: incentivize the use of natural and clean energy resources

Due to the colonization and commercialization of the environment over the last couple of centuries which
has reduced the area’s land, water, and food quality, Tempe needs to develop land practices that improve
living standards for the most affected.
The relationship between the land and its people can improve through the following:
• Indigenization of Tempe: acknowledge colonization and integrate Indigenous knowledge
• Regenerative landscaping: promote regenerative agriculture, farms, and backyard gardens
• Connectivity: use tree canopies along bike and walking paths
• Resilient landscape: plant native vegetation to increase urban cooling and water conservation
• Indigenous ownership: historical unceded land is given back to Indigenous communities

Partnership
Community-Based Organizations
Some residents do not feel safe navigating the city system. Hiring a
community-based organization to facilitate City-resident relationships
gives residents an opportunity to voice their concerns on important
issues addressed. Community-Based Organizations can work on
responding to climate change and climate justice inequities through:
• Outreach: increasing partnerships between City and
community-based organizations to carry out planning and
implementation
• Education: producing training to support residents’ energy and
resilience needs
• Equity: responding to community inequities and ensuring
collective well-being across Tempe

Tempe residents want all community voices to be heard at the City level. Karla and Mariela are two women of
color who are poised to improve their neighborhoods and have their voices heard.

Karla M. Paez
Karla M. Paez is a Latina mother of four and a Tempe resident. She and her
family use the Escalante Community Center to learn about environmental
justice through workshops offered by Unlimited Potential.
Climate Action Work: Karla is motivated by the belief that present and
future generations deserve clean air to breathe and clean parks to play in.
She teaches her children to care for the environment by not littering and
picking up after others’ litter.
Karla advocates for environmental justice because she believes that every
community member, regardless of where they live, should have green and
beautiful natural spaces. She also supports her community’s efforts to gain
equal rights for a more dignified life, a better future for children, and to
address the violence and oppression of women.
“All of us as a community have the right to benefit from green and beautiful spaces and we should join together
to preserve nature for all of us. I hope the future of Tempe is greener and less extreme. Tempe residents should
get informed, get involved, understand their rights, and advocate for the rights of everyone to live in a clean
and healthy city.”

Mariela Acosta
Mariela Acosta is a Latina mother of four children and a Tempe resident.
She supports local farmers by purchasing their produce and learns about
environmental justice through workshops at the Escalante Community
Center.
Climate Action Work: Mariela advocates for environmental justice because
she sees her community struggle each day for sustenance. She believes
in a better world with clean air and a clean economy. Mariela leads by
example, encouraging her family to use less energy, conserve water, and
avoid purchasing plastic and disposable products.
“I hope Tempe will lower energy costs and mitigate extreme heat. Human
beings need to take better care of the environment for themselves and
their families. If nothing is done, heat will become worse for people and

Infrastructure (GSI) project.

Tempe residents understand the importance of climate action and through lived experience are able to
advocate for what changes are needed in our neighborhoods and communities. A virtual forum hosted
by the City of Tempe’s Office of Sustainability and Resilience, in June 2021 provided an opportunity for
Tempe residents to engage with several topics that were highlighted as important by residents in previous
engagements. This included resilience to extreme heat, partnerships with community-based organizations
around equity, and Highlight Actions regarding Resilient Energy Hubs and Mobility Hubs. In attendance were
Tempe parents, business owners, ASU students and faculty, City of Tempe staff, organization leaders, renters,
homeowners, and more.

Action
Resilience to Extreme Heat
Heat poses issues for residents in Tempe more extremely than
any other city in the country. Tempe residents understand this and
continue to ask the city to address these issues. The City of Tempe’s
Office of Sustainability and Resilience is working on several programs
to address extreme heat, including the Cool Kids program, but
residents know that there is much more that must be done. Extreme
heat is not only a health and safety issue, but a climate justice and
equity issue. It is imperative that Tempe address issues related
to extreme heat and work on transformative actions that create
immediate impact for our communities, especially the most vulnerable.

Neighborhoods Agenda
Resilience to Extreme Heat (Equity)

A final design for future Tempe transit shelters using
shade and cool materials.

To address equity regarding extreme heat in Tempe, residents
believe that the city must:
• Create policies to make electricity more affordable for all
homeowners and renters, including expanding energy
assistance and energy equity programs
• Implement programs that ensure energy is always available
for all residents
• Provide rebates and incentives for solar panel
implementation
• Hold utilities accountable for a transition to renewable energy
• Build social capital and focus on community-led solutions to
extreme heat
• Provide services for people experiencing homelessness to
seek shelter in times of extreme heat

Partnership
Community-Based Organizations and Equity
While equity was mentioned in Tempe’s previous Climate Action Plan,
it was not a central focus. Residents demand that the City of Tempe
address equity and climate justice. In order to fully embrace a climate
justice approach that centers equity, the City of Tempe can partner
with community-based organizations on projects that address the
following issues:

Highlight Action
Resilient Energy Hubs and Resiliece Hubs
Tempe neighborhoods can increase connections and community
resilience through strategic investment in resilience energy hubs and
resilience hubs that follows the example of work in Puerto Rico.
Best Practice: Puerto Rico Mercy Corps Resilience Hubs
Resilience Hubs are community-oriented facilities that provide a
place for residents to seek shelter during times of emergency. Mercy
Corps, a nonprofit organization that focuses on helping communities
prosper in the “face of disaster, poverty, and the impacts of climate
change,” manages 17 Resilience Hub locations around Puerto Rico.
Some of the main features of Mercy Corps resilience hubs include:
• Community gardens
• Internet connectivity
• Disaster risk reduction and education workshops
• Off-grid solar energy (Resilient Energy Hub)
• Potable water
• Storage and distribution of emergency non-food items
Mercy Corps resilience hub in Puerto Rico.

Resilience hubs are essential in providing year-round services to vulnerable communities and in supporting
all community members in preparing for disaster. Having a resilience hub in a community provides a sense of
security with the knowledge that shelter, food, water, electricity and more can be found during a crisis.

Municipal Actions
In addition to community actions, the city government has focused on actions it can perform to be
sustainable and resilient. In 2015, Tempe collected data to form the city’s first municipal GHG emissions
inventory. A new inventory was completed in 2020, which showed a 2.5% decrease in overall municipal
emissions. Emissions decreased in almost every sector over a 5-year period. This is a positive trend that the
city hopes to reinforce through further action. Tempe set a goal of carbon neutrality in municipal operations
by 2050 with a strategy of 100% renewable energy by 2035. The following sections provide strategies the
city will employ to decrease GHG emissions in city operations.

Municipal GHG Inventory
In 2020, the total municipal emissions were 39,657
MT of CO2e. Approximately 75% of the city’s
GHG emissions were from electricity production,
while 24% of total emissions came from the
transportation sector. Tempe owns 120 buildings,
which account for 30% of the city’s electricity
consumption and GHG emissions. Outdoor lighting,
which includes 17,000 streetlights, park lights, and
traffic signals, accounts for 18% of total emissions.
The City of Tempe manages two drinking water
treatment plants that consume approximately 22
million kWh of electricity per year, or 27% of the
municipal GHG emissions. Tempe’s municipal and
transit fleets account for 22% of total emissions.
Solid waste is transported to neighboring cities,
specifically Phoenix, for disposal, and accounts for
less than 1% of total emissions.

City Partners: Community Services, Engineering and Transportation, Municipal Utilities, and Community
Development
External Partners: SRPMIC, Trees Matter, Tempe Union High School District, Tempe Elementary District,
Arizona Sustainability Alliance and Keep Tempe Beautiful
Budget: $67,500
Project Timeline: 2021-2022
Objective: To mitigate the negative effects of extreme heat through climate-sensitive urban forestry.
Outcome: To develop pilot projects on city property and local schools that demonstrate the benefits of
native pollinator gardens, desert-adapted trees and green stormwater infrastructure while working to
achieve a citywide 25% tree and shade canopy by 2040.
This initiative aims to contribute to urban cooling by planting native vegetation around Tempe. Increased
vegetation cools surface temperatures and absorbs runoff water from rain and irrigation. This project funds the
installation and maintenance of native vegetation, which requires less water and is drought tolerant, helping
them survive in extreme heat.
The grant is funding a native pollinator forest at 12th Street and Mill Avenue and demonstration projects at
Thew Elementary, Tempe High School and McClintock High School. Funding is paired with additional resources
from grants and donations from the city, APS, SRP and Trees Matter. Additional demonstration sites at schools
and on city property will be added as funding allows.
Policy, program and infrastructure recommendations coming out of this work will include:
• Increase investment in urban forest
• Increase investment in green stormwater infrastructure
• Water conservation
• Resilience to extreme heat

Cool Kids, Cool Places, Cool Futures (Neighborhood Justice)

Youth-led Climate Action leading to citywide and regional equitable cooling solutions.

Funder: Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
City Partners: Community Services, Human Services, Fire Medical Rescue
External Partners: Arizona State University, Tempe Union High School District
Budget: $590,000
Project Timeline: 2021- 2023
Objective: Support students in advancing resilience to extreme heat in the Escalante and Gilliland neighborhoods,
Tempe, and Maricopa County through art, policy and cooling projects.
Outcome: Use the transformation of Tempe schools and neighborhoods to inspire a regional cooling authority or
utility to design, fund and implement cooling infrastructure and programs throughout Maricopa County.
Cool Kids, Cool Places, Cool Futures is a project that aims to organize youth across the City of Tempe to take
action on resilience to extreme heat. This opportunity shifts power and gives voice to the next generation
of Tempe leaders. Cool Kids is organized by two youth councils of ten to fifteen core students that focus on
advancing resilience to extreme heat efforts in the Escalante and Gilliland neighborhoods, two communities
most impacted by heat-related issues. The students refer to the project as Neighborhood Justice. Youth council
members will be supported by ASU researchers, City of Tempe staff, artists, local teachers, and social workers to
give guidance on completing various community projects that address climate, health, and equity. Cool Kids draws
inspiration from three global ideas:
1. New Zealand’s implementation of a community-based emergency management plan that enables
communities to self-organize in the event of an emergency
2. Morocco’s youth coalitions that organized their art skills into collective action on infrastructure
3. Medellin, Colombia’s district-based participation process that helped local agencies create new public
utilities
Cool Kids (Neighborhood Justice) combines these global ideas with existing Tempe and regional assets including
the Mayor’s Youth Advisory Council, Community Arts program, Tempe’s urban forestry program, Tempe’s
emergency management program, and resilience to extreme heat expertise and indigenous concepts of resilience.
The intention is for the change the students create at the school and neighborhood level to influence the city and
the region to adopt a new approach to equitable cooling.
Policy, program and infrastructure recommendation coming out of this work will include:
• Resilience to extreme heat
• Green Stormwater Infrastructure
• Urban Forestry Master Plan
• Emergency Management and Community Resilience programs
