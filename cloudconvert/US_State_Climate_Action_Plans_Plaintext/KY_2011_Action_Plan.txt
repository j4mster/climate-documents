Fellow Kentuckians,
On behalf of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, I present the final report of the Kentucky
Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC). This report is a culmination of two years of work performed by
KCAPC members, staff and others who provided technical expertise. The Report presents the methods
and the pros and cons of more than 70 policy options that are intended to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions from all sources in the commonwealth while also encouraging energy efficiency, energy
security, and economic growth. It provides the reader a greater understanding of KentuckyIs
opportunities and challenges to reduce these emissions.
A significant outcome of the KCAPC process was the discussion and debate among leaders from
many sectors of Kentucky (the business community, environmental advocates, utilities, energy
providers, government, and academia). When this process began, it seemed imminent that the U.S.
Congress would impose limits on greenhouse gas emissions. While this topic is no longer at the
forefront of the agenda for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the need remains for
Kentucky to be positioned to take action should such a requirement come about. We should also
continue to develop technologies that will enable us to harness energy from cleaner sources and to
reduce the emissions from fossil fuels so that we can continue using the stateIs affordable and abundant
natural resources in an environmentally sensitive manner. This report reaffirms that energy efficiency is
the most cost effective and easiest means of reducing emissions. It is also a useful resource that
assembles information in one place for easy reference.
Further discussion and analysis of benefits and costs of each policy option would be needed to
move forward, but this report provides a meaningful starting place. I commend those who have worked
so diligently throughout the process. This is not a simple issue with simple solutions, but rather one that
requires intelligent and honest discussionOthe type of discussion, I expect, will continue in Kentucky.

Sincerely,
Secretary Leonard K. Peters,

Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet

Executive Summary
Background
In November 2008, Governor Steven Beshear issued a report entitled Intelligent Energy Choices
for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy Independence. 1 One of the
provisions of the 7-Point Energy Strategy is to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and to
reduce Kentucky’s carbon footprint. Development of the Climate Action Plan for Kentucky is
aimed at furthering this objective to reduce Kentucky’s carbon footprint. The Climate Action
Plan has been built upon selected provisions of the Kentucky Energy Strategy. It also focuses
attention on creating opportunities to build on Kentucky’s progress to date to become more
energy efficient, to reduce dependence on foreign oil, to enhance the nation’s energy security, to
promote new energy-related technologies, and to enhance economic opportunities in Kentucky.
The Kentucky Climate Action Plan process was convened in January 2010 by Dr. Len Peters,
Secretary of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). Secretary Peters
established the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) to assist in developing the
Kentucky Climate Action Plan. The Council consists of a broad coalition of 27 members,
including stakeholders from the business, academic, government, nonprofit, and environmental
sectors, as well as individual citizens. Members of the Council are listed on page iii of this
report.
The KCAPC was charged with producing a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory and
forecast (I&F), compiling a comprehensive Climate Action Plan with recommended GHG
reduction goals and potential actions to mitigate climate change and improve energy efficiency
in various sectors of the economy, and advising state and local governments on measures to
address climate change.
The KCAPC held six in-person meetings and one teleconference meeting leading to this draft
Final Report submitted to KEEC and the Kentucky Department for Energy Development and
Independence (DEDI).
To provide a broad range of technical expertise and stakeholder involvement in development of
the Climate Action Plan, the Secretary and the KCPAC also formed five Technical Work Groups
(TWGs) to assist in the process. The five TWGs considered information and potential options in
the following sectors:
•

Energy Supply (ES);

•

Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI);

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste (AFW); and

•

Cross-Cutting Issues (CCI) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

Energy Independence, November 2008.

ExS-1

The Commonwealth of Kentucky hired the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) to provide
technical and facilitation support to KEEC and the KCAPC in formulating the Kentucky Climate
Action Plan. CCS has extensive experience assisting states in formulating state climate action
plans, preparing GHG I&Fs, and conducting numerous related technical and economic studies
associated with climate change. CCS provided facilitation and technical assistance to the
KCAPC and to each of the TWGs. The TWGs served as advisors to the KCAPC and consisted of
KCAPC members and additional individuals with expertise in their respective sectors. Members
of the public were invited to observe and provide input at all meetings of the KCAPC and
TWGs. The TWGs assisted the KCAPC by generating initial Kentucky-specific policy options to
be added to a catalog of existing state actions; developing priority policy options for analysis;
drafting proposals on the design characteristics and quantification of the proposed policy options;
reviewing specifications for analysis of draft policy options (including best available data
sources, methods, and assumptions); and evaluating the other key elements of policy option
proposals, including related policies and programs, key uncertainties, co-benefits and costs,
feasibility issues, and potential barriers to consensus.

Key Elements and Recommendations
The KCAPC developed this Climate Action Plan, which includes, but is not limited to, the
following key elements and recommendations:
•

The KCAPC’s proposed GHG reduction goals for Kentucky are to achieve a 20% reduction
of GHGs below 1990 levels by 2030 (from about 136.7 to 109.4 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent [MMtCO2e]). The KCAPC also recommends that energy
efficiency and energy intensity goals, targets, and metrics be developed for the major sectors
of the Commonwealth’s economy over the next several years. These goals were developed
taking into account Governor Steven Beshear’s report Intelligent Energy Choices for
Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy Independence.

•

The KCAPC approved a package of 46 multi-sector policy recommendations to reduce GHG
emissions and address related energy and commerce issues in Kentucky. Of the 46 policy
recommendations, 33 were analyzed quantitatively to have the effect of reducing GHG
emissions by about 63.7 MMtCO2e in 2020 and 128.3 MMtCO2e in 2030, and a cumulative
GHG emissions reduction of 1,316 MMtCO2e over the 2011–2030 period.

•

The KCAPC-approved policy recommendations are projected to have a net cost of about
$11.6 billion during the period 2011–2030. The weighted-average cost-effectiveness of these
policies is estimated to be approximately $8.80/tCO2e.

•

The KCAPC work included development of the first comprehensive, statewide GHG
emissions I&F report for Kentucky for the period 1990–2030.

ExS-2

It is important to note that this set of recommended policies is presented to Secretary
Peters for consideration. The data and costs presented in this report are based on the
information and assumptions available at the time of analysis during 2010 and 2011. It is
acknowledged that these recommendations may require updated data and further review
and analysis prior to implementation. It is also acknowledged that many of these
recommendations would require action by other entities, such as the Kentucky General
Assembly and/or the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

Kentucky GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
CCS prepared the Kentucky I&F report for the KEEC. The report presents an assessment of
Kentucky’s GHG emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon storage) from 1990 to 2030. The
final I&F report, which was approved by the KCAPC at its meeting on June 2, 2010, is
summarized in Chapter 2 of this report and is available in its entirety at: http://www.
kyclimatechange.us/ewebeditpro/items/O122F23537.pdf. It is important to note that the analysis
was done during 2009–2010, and recent announcements by utilities and more recent actions by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency are not included in the 2010 I&F report.
The inventory and reference case projections cover the six types of gases included in the U.S.
Greenhouse Gas Inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),
hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions
of these GHGs are presented using a common metric—CO2 equivalence (CO2e)—that indicates
the relative contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a
global warming potential (GWP)-weighted basis. 2
The inventory and reference case projections revealed substantial emission growth rates and
related mitigation challenges. Figure ExS-1 shows the reference case projections for Kentucky’s
gross GHG emissions as rising fairly steeply to 247.7 MMtCO2e by 2030, growing by 81% over
1990 levels. The figure also provides the breakdown of projected GHG emissions by sector.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple measure
of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system. Holding everything else constant, increases in
GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the absorption
of energy by the Earth)., See: Boucher, O., et al. “Radiative Forcing of Climate Change.” Chapter 6 in Climate
Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Contribution of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press. Available at: http://www.grida.no/climate/

GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; RCI = direct fuel use in
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors; ODS = ozone-depleting substance; Ind. = industrial.

The inventory and reference case projections of Kentucky’s GHG emissions provided the
following critical findings:
•

The principal sources of Kentucky’s GHG emissions are electricity consumption,
transportation, and RCI fuel use, accounting for 50%, 20%, and 17% of Kentucky’s gross
GHG emissions in 2005, respectively.

•

Estimates of carbon sinks within Kentucky’s forests and soils, including urban forests, landuse changes, and agricultural soil cultivation practices, are included in this report. The
current estimates indicate that about 7.6 MMtCO2e of emissions were stored in Kentucky
biomass in 2005. This leads to net emissions of about 176 MMtCO2e in Kentucky in 2005, an
amount equal to 2.8% of total U.S. net GHG emissions.

•

The use of coal has led to low electricity rates in Kentucky compared to the rest of the
country, which has allowed energy-intensive industries that provide valuable goods and
services beyond the borders of Kentucky to flourish in the state, as acknowledged in
Kentucky’s Energy Plan. 3

While Kentucky’s estimated emissions growth rate presents challenges, it also provides major
opportunities. Key choices regarding technologies and infrastructure can have a significant
impact on emissions growth in Kentucky. The KCAPC’s recommendations document the

opportunities for the state to reduce its GHG emissions, while continuing its strong economic
growth by being more energy efficient, using more renewable energy sources, and increasing the
use of cleaner transportation modes, technologies, and fuels.
Figure ExS-2 depicts a comparison between the sectoral components of GHG emissions in 2005
in Kentucky compared to the United States at large. Electricity supply and transportation are
projected to have the highest growth.

Notes: Res/Com = residential and commercial fuel use sectors; emissions for the residential, commercial, and
industrial fuel use sectors are associated with the direct use of fuels (natural gas, petroleum, coal, and wood) to
provide space heating, water heating, process heating, cooking, and other energy end-uses. The commercial sector
accounts for emissions associated with the direct use of fuels by, for example, hospitals, schools, government
buildings (local, county, and state), and other commercial establishments. The industrial processes sector accounts
for emissions associated with manufacturing and excludes emissions included in the industrial fuel use sector. The
transportation sector accounts for emissions associated with fuel consumption by all on-road and non-highway
vehicles. Non-highway vehicles include jet aircraft, gasoline-fueled piston aircraft, railway locomotives, boats, and
ships. Emissions from non-highway agricultural and construction equipment are included in the industrial sector.
Electricity = electricity generation sector emissions on a consumption basis (including emissions associated with

ExS-5

electricity imported from outside of Kentucky and excluding emissions associated with electricity exported from
Kentucky to other states and regions).

Recent Actions
GHG Reductions Associated with Recent Federal and State Actions
The KCAPC identified recent federal and state actions undertaken in Kentucky that will reduce
GHG emissions while conserving energy and promoting the development and use of renewable
energy sources. The resultant emission reductions are presented below. The total GHG
reductions from recent federal and state actions is projected to be about 9.4 MMtCO2e in 2030,
or a 3.8 % reduction from the business-as-usual (BAU) emissions in 2030 for all sectors
combined. These GHG emission reductions are summarized in Figure ExS-3.
Recent Federal Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 was signed into law in December
2007. This law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they are
implemented over the next few years. During the KCAPC process, sufficient information was
identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with
implementing the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements, utility energy
efficiency programs, and high-efficiency public buildings in Kentucky. The GHG emission
reductions projected to be achieved by these actions are shown in Figure ExS-3. Together, these
federal requirements are estimated to reduce gross GHG emissions for all sectors combined in
Kentucky by about 4.02 MMtCO2e (a 1.8% reduction) from the BAU emissions in 2020, and by
about 6.23 MMtCO2e (a 2.5% reduction) from the BAU emissions in 2030.

Recent State Actions
Kentucky has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to
concerns about energy costs. Two existing state programs have also been included as recent
actions. The Kentucky existing electric utility demand-side management actions are projected to
yield reductions of 1.7 MMtCO2e in 2030, and the Kentucky Government Green Buildings
program (House Bill 2) is projected to yield an additional 1.5 MMtCO2e of reductions in 2030.

KCAPC Policy Recommendations (Beyond Recent Actions)
The KCAPC recommended 46 policy actions. Figure ExS-4 presents a graphical summary of the
potential cumulative emission reductions associated with the recent federal and state actions and
the 33 policy recommendations relative to the BAU reference case projections. Table ExS-1
provides the numeric estimates underlying Figure ExS-4. In Figure ExS-4:
•

The red line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
2020, 2025 and 2030) levels of Kentucky’ gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis.
(The consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Kentucky to meet the state’s demand for electricity.) The red line for 2010–
2030 includes projected emissions associated with recent federal and state actions that were
analyzed quantitatively.

•

The black line with blue diamonds portrays the reference case projections for 2010–2030 if
no recent actions or additional policy options were enacted—the BAU scenario.

•

The green line shows the projected GHG emission levels associated with the KCAPC’s
recommendation for Kentucky to adopt a statewide, economy-wide GHG reduction goal to
reduce the state’s gross GHG emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2030. Together, if the
33 quantified policy recommendations and the recent federal and state actions (or their
equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2030 emission reduction goal would be
virtually achieved, based on results of analysis of KCAPC proposals conducted through the
KCAPC and TWG process. (Note that other KCAPC recommendations would have the effect
of reducing emissions, but those reductions were not analyzed quantitatively, so are not
reflected in the green line.)

Table ExS-2 depicts a cumulative summary by sector of the policy recommendations and the
estimated GHG reductions and costs/savings of implementing the KCAPC-recommended
policies, after being adjusted for overlaps. In Table ExS-2 and throughout the Climate Action
ExS-8

Plan, positive cost figures ($) indicate costs; negative cost (–$) figures indicate cost savings. For
example, in Table ExS-2 the TLU Cost-Effectiveness estimate of (–$126/ tCO2e) portrays a cost
savings of $126 per metric ton of CO2e. For the policies recommended by the KCAPC to yield
the levels of estimated emission reductions shown in Table ExS-3, they must be implemented in
a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.

The values in this table do not include the effects of recent actions. Negative values in the Net Present Value and the
Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings associated with the policy recommendations.
Within each sector, values have been adjusted to eliminate double counting for policies or elements of policies that
overlap. In addition, values associated with policies or elements of policies within a sector that overlap with policies or
elements of policies in another sector have been adjusted to eliminate double counting. Appendix F (for the ES
sector), Appendix G (for the RCI sectors), Appendix E (for the AFW sectors), and Appendix H (for the TLU sectors) of
this report provide documentation of how sector-level emission reductions and costs (or cost savings) were adjusted
to eliminate double counting associated with overlaps between policies.

Table ExS-3, which begins below and continues through page ExS-16 summarizes the policy
options analyzed and approved by the KCAPC as recommendations to be included in this report.
During the final two meetings of the process, the policy options were reviewed and acted upon
by the KCAPC. Of the 47 policies considered: 46 policy options were approved by a majority of
the KCAPC members present and voting at the time of consideration of each of the policies. One
policy option analyzed, ES-12, was not approved by the KCAPC. The sector tables below match
the summary tables in each of the TWG appendices (E, F, G, H, and I). Each of the segments of
the table portrays the policy recommendations, projected GHG emission reductions, the net
present value costs or cost savings. and the cost-effectiveness of each policy option. The detailed
narrative explaining each policy option is included in the respective appendices to this report.
Note that the numbering used to denote the policy recommendation in Table ExS-3 and in other
parts of this report is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect prioritization among these
important recommendations.

The benefits of increased forest carbon sequestration will last far beyond the policy period. When GHG reductions
and cost-effectiveness are calculated considering the lifetime of the forest (~50 years), the results are 3.3 MMtCO2e
and 5.3 $/tCO2e, respectively.

Negative values in the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings.
Negative NPV represents positive net cash flows from the policy recommendation (the costs of the policy, i.e., new
energy efficiency equipment (air conditioners, furnaces, etc.), when levelized over their expected lifetimes, are less
than expected energy expenditures. Policy recommendations with estimated cost savings still are likely to require
significant up-front capital investment for the new energy efficiency equipment.

N/A = not applicable; PBF = Public Benefit Fund.
GHG reductions are calculated for each year (columns three and four above) and the cumulative for 2010–2030
(column five).
The cost per tCO2e (column seven) over 2010–2030 is the discounted, net present value of the 2010–2030 cash
flows in millions of dollars (column six) divided by the cumulative MMtCO2e of GHG reductions (column five).
The numbering used to denote the above policy recommendations is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect
prioritization among these important policies.
*This analysis reflects the use of full-fuel-cycle GHG emission factors.
On October 27, 2010, the RCI Technical Work Group (TWG) discussed the issue of direct versus “full-fuel-cycle”
emission factors. Full-fuel-cycle GHG emission factors include the GHG emissions associated with the production,
processing, transmission, and distribution of fuels and electricity. These “upstream” emissions associated with energy
supply are 5%–25% greater than direct, or end-use, emission factors that are calculated as a result of fuel
combustion at the power station or building. On the October 27 call, the RCI TWG decided to present the summary
table above showing GHG emissions and cost-effectiveness based on full-fuel-cycle emission factors. The work
group also decided that the results for each RCI policy recommendation should show both direct and full fuel cycle
emissions factors. On balance, the difference in 2011–2030 cumulative GHG reductions is about 10% between the
two methodologies. The choice of emission factor does not impact the net present value calculations. However,
because cumulative 2011–2030 GHG emission reductions are increased under full-fuel-cycle emission factors, the
$/ton cost-effectiveness estimates will differ modestly between the two methodologies.

The cost analysis provides figures that represent the net of both positive up-front costs and cost savings over time.
Data results that indicate the potential for net cost savings should be viewed with an understanding that in some
cases, initial up-front costs may be necessary in order to achieve the net cost savings over time.
ExS-15

Negative values in the Net Present Value and the Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings. Negative
net present value represents positive net cash flows from the policy recommendation (i.e., the costs of the policy
recommendation, when levelized over their expected lifetimes, are less than expected expenditures). Policy
recommendations with estimated costs savings still are likely to require significant up-front capital investments.

As explained previously, the KCAPC considered the estimates of the GHG reductions that could
be achieved and the costs (or cost savings) for the 33 recommended policy options that were
quantifiable. It is important to note that there is some level of uncertainty in projecting GHG
reductions and estimating exact costs (or cost savings) per ton of reductions achieved for the
time period of this analysis.

Figure ExS-7 presents a step-wise marginal cost curve for Kentucky. The horizontal (x) axis
represents the percentage of GHG emission reductions in 2030 for each policy recommendation
relative to the BAU forecast. The vertical (y) axis represents the marginal cost of mitigation
(expressed as the cost-effectiveness of each policy recommendation on a cumulative basis,
2011–2030). In the figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual policy. The width of
the segment indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the recommendation in
percentage terms. The height of the segment relative to the vertical axis shows the average cost
(or saving) of reducing 1 tCO2e of GHG emissions with the application of the recommendation.
Note that recommendation steps appearing below the “$0” line near the middle of the graph (on
the vertical axis) are cost-saving measures, while the recommendations above this line have
positive net direct costs. It is important to note that some of the policy options with an estimated
cost savings still are likely to require significant up-front investments.

Chapter 1
Background and Overview
Creation of the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council
In November 2008, Governor Steven Beshear issued a report entitled Intelligent Energy Choices
for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy Independence. 1 One of the
provisions of the 7-Point Energy Strategy is to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and to
reduce Kentucky’s carbon footprint. Development of the Climate Action Plan for Kentucky is
aimed at furthering this objective to reduce Kentucky’s carbon footprint. The Climate Action
Plan has been built upon selected provisions of the Kentucky Energy Strategy. It also focuses
attention on creating opportunities to build on Kentucky’s progress to date to become more
energy efficient, to reduce dependence on foreign oil, to enhance the nation’s energy security, to
promote new energy-related technologies, and to enhance economic opportunities in Kentucky.
The Kentucky Climate Action Plan process was convened in January 2010 by Dr. Len Peters,
Secretary of the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). Secretary Peters
established the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) to assist in developing the
Kentucky Climate Action Plan. The Council consists of a broad coalition of 27 members,
including stakeholders from the business, academic, government, nonprofit, and environmental
sectors, as well as individual citizens. Members of the Council are listed on page iii of this
report.
The Commonwealth of Kentucky hired the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) to provide
technical and facilitation support to KEEC and the KCAPC in formulating the Kentucky Climate
Action Plan. CCS has extensive experience assisting states in formulating state climate action
plans, preparing GHG inventories and forecasts, and conducting numerous related technical and
economic studies associated with climate change.
It is important to note that this set of recommended policies is presented to Secretary
Peters for consideration. The data and costs presented in this report are based on the
information and assumptions available at the time of analysis during 2010 and 2011. It is
acknowledged that these recommendations may require updated data and further review
and analysis prior to implementation. It is also acknowledged that many of these
recommendations would require action by other entities, including the Kentucky General
Assembly and/or the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

The KCAPC’s Response
The KCAPC used an open, systematic, step-wise decision-making process to develop
Kentucky’s Climate Action Plan. The process is spelled out in detail in a Process Memo and
Work Plan that can be found on the project Web site at www.kyclimatechange.us. As a result of
the Council’s work, the Climate Action Plan provides the following key recommendations and
accomplishments:
1

Governor Steven Beshear, Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point
Strategy for Energy Independence, November 2008.
1-1

•

Recommendation of a comprehensive set of 46 specific policies to reduce greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and address climate, energy, and commerce-related issues in Kentucky. Of
the 46 policy recommendations, 33 were analyzed quantitatively to have a cumulative effect
of reducing GHG emissions by about 63.7 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MMtCO2e) in 2020 and 128.3 MMtCO2e in 2030. Explanations of all policies and any
objections are in Appendices E through I of this report, which contain detailed accounts of
the KCAPC’s recommendations.

•

Recommendation that Kentucky establish a statewide, economy-wide GHG reduction goal to
reduce the state’s GHG emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2030. The KCAPC based its
recommendations on its review of the potential overall emission reduction estimates (as
compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast [I&F]) for policy options for which
emission reductions were quantified, and its review of goals and targets included in Governor
Steven Beshear’s report Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7Point Strategy for Energy Independence. This target GHG reduction level is the same as in
the 7- Point Energy Strategy, but would be achieved in 2030 instead of 2025 due to some of
the key policies coming to fruition to yield reductions in the last 5-year interval of the
planning period (2025–2030). Together, if the 33 quantified policy recommendations and the
recent federal actions (or their functional equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2030
GHG emission reduction goal would be virtually achieved based on results of analysis of
KCAPC proposals conducted through the KCAPC and Technical Work Group (TWG)
process.

•

Evaluation of the direct costs and direct cost savings of the policy recommendations in
Kentucky. The KCAPC analyzed quantitatively the direct costs or cost savings of 33 of its 46
policy recommendations. Although the total net cost associated with the 46 policies analyzed
(47 policies were analyzed; 1 was rejected) is estimated at about $11.56 billion between 2011
and 2030, the weighted-average cost-effectiveness of the 33 policies is estimated to be
approximately $8.8/tCO2e reduced. Many of the policies are estimated to yield significant
cost-saving opportunities for Kentucky, but may have significant initial costs. Other policies
will incur net costs.

•

Review, update, and approval of a comprehensive I&F of GHG emissions in Kentucky for
1990 through 2030. This is the first comprehensive, statewide GHG I&F that has been
developed for Kentucky. It has benefited from the expertise of many KCAPC and TWG
members, along with agency staff who provided state-specific data.

Recent Actions
GHG Reductions Associated with Recent Federal Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) was signed into law in
December 2007. This law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they
are implemented over the next few years. During the KCAPC process, sufficient information was
identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with
implementing the federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements, utility energy
efficiency programs as well as high efficiency public buildings in Kentucky. The GHG emission
reductions projected to be achieved by these actions are shown in Figure 1-1. Table 1-1 provides
the numeric estimates underlying Figure 1-1. Together, these federal requirements are estimated
1-2

to reduce gross GHG emissions for all sectors combined in Kentucky by about 4.02 MMtCO2e (a
1.8% reduction) from the business-as-usual (BAU) emissions in 2020, and by about 6.23
MMtCO2e (a 2.5% reduction) from the BAU emissions in 2030.

Recent State Actions
Kentucky has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to
concerns about energy costs. Two existing state programs have also been included as recent
actions. The Kentucky existing electric utility demand-side management actions are projected to
yield reductions of 1.7 MMtCO2e in 2030, and the Kentucky House Bill 2 Government Green
Buildings program is projected to yield an additional 1.5 MMtCO2e of reductions in 2030. The
total GHG reductions from recent federal and state actions is projected to be about 9.4 MMtCO2e
in 2030, or a 3.8 % reduction from the BAU emissions in 2030 for all sectors combined.

The KCAPC Process
The KCAPC began its deliberative process at its first meeting on January 19, 2010, and met a
total of seven times, with the final decisional meeting held via teleconference on August 25,
2011. In all, about 60 meetings and teleconferences of the KCAPC and the five supporting
TWGs were held to identify and analyze various potential policy actions in advance of the
KCAPC’s final meeting.
The five TWGs considered information and potential recommendations in the following sectors:
•

Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI);

•

Energy Supply (ES);

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW); and

•

Cross-Cutting Issues (CCI) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

CCS provided facilitation and technical assistance to the KCAPC and each of the TWGs, based
on a detailed proposal approved by KEEC. The TWGs consisted of KCAPC members plus
additional technical experts. The TWG members are listed in Appendix B of this report.
Members of the public were invited to observe and provide input at all meetings of the KCAPC
and TWGs. The TWGs served as advisers to the KCAPC, and helped generate initial
recommendations on Kentucky-specific policy options to be added to the catalog of existing
states actions; priority policy recommendations for analysis; draft proposals on the design
characteristics and quantification of the proposed policy recommendations; specifications and
assistance for analysis of draft policy options (including best available data sources, methods,
and assumptions); and other key elements of policy option proposals, including related policies
and programs, key uncertainties, co-benefits and costs, feasibility issues, and potential barriers to
consensus. Where members of a TWG did not fully agree on recommendations to the KCAPC,
the summary of their efforts was reported to the KCAPC as a part of its consideration and
actions. The KCAPC then made its decisions after reviewing the TWGs’ proposals, including
modifications as deemed appropriate in their judgment.
The KCAPC process employed a model of informed self-determination through a facilitated,
step-wise, fact-based, and consensus-building approach. The process was based on procedures
that CCS has used in a number of other state climate change planning initiatives since 2000, but
was adapted specifically for Kentucky. The KCAPC process sought but did not mandate

1-4

consensus. The process documented any barriers to full consensus where they existed on final
consideration of proposed actions. Out of the approximately 380 potential options the KCAPC
considered, the 46 policy recommendations presented in this report were developed by the
KCAPC through a step-wise approach that included: (1) expanding an initial list of about 310
existing states actions to include about 70 additional actions, including Kentucky-specific
actions; (2) identifying a set of about 48 priority options for further analysis and development;
(3) fleshing these proposals out for full analysis by development of “straw proposals” for level of
effort, timing, and parties involved in implementation; (4) developing and applying a common
framework of analysis for options, including sector-specific guidance and detailed specifications
for options that include data sources, methods, and key assumptions; (5) reviewing results of
analysis and modifying proposals as needed to address potential barriers to consensus; (6)
finalizing design and analysis of options to remove barriers to final agreement; and (7)
developing other key elements of policy proposals, such as implementation mechanisms, cobenefits, and feasibility considerations.
During the final two meetings of the process, KCAPC members present and voting approved 46
policy options and rejected 1 policy option (ES-12). The TWGs’ recommendations to the
KCAPC were documented and presented to the KCAPC at each KCAPC meeting. All of the
KCAPC and TWG meetings were open to the public, and all materials for and summaries of the
KCAPC and TWG meetings are posted on the KCAPC Web site (www.kyclimatechange.us). A
description of the deliberative process is included in Appendix A.

Analysis of Policy Recommendations
With CCS providing facilitation and technical analysis, the five TWGs submitted
recommendations for policies for KCAPC consideration using a “policy option template”
conveying the following key information:
Policy Description
Policy Design (Goals, Timing, Parties Involved)
Implementation Mechanisms
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Key Uncertainties
Additional Benefits and Costs
Feasibility Issues
Status of Group Approval
Level of Group Support
Barriers to Consensus
In its deliberations, the KCAPC reviewed, modified, and reached group agreement on various
policy recommendations. The final versions for each sector, conforming to the policy option
templates, appear in Appendices E through I of this report, and constitute the most detailed
record of decisions of the KCAPC. Appendix D describes the methods used to quantify 34 of the
47 policy options. The quantitative analysis produced estimates of the GHG emission reductions
and direct net costs (or cost savings) of implementation of various policies, in terms of both a net

1-5

present value from 2011 to 2030 and a dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness). The key
methods are summarized below.
Estimates of GHG Reductions
Using the projection of future GHG emissions (see below) as a starting point, 34 policy options
were analyzed by CCS to estimate the GHG reductions attributable to each policy in the
individual years of 2020 and 2030, and the cumulative reductions over the period 2011–2030.
The estimates were prepared in accordance with guidance provided by the five TWGs and the
KCAPC, which later reviewed the estimates and, in some cases, directed that they be revised
with respect to such elements as goals, data sources, assumptions, sensitivity analysis, and
methodology. Many policies were estimated to affect the quantity or type of fossil fuel
combusted; others affected methane or CO2 sequestered. Among the many assumptions involved
in this task was selection of the appropriate GHG accounting framework—namely, the choice
between taking a “production-based” approach versus a “consumption-based” approach to
various sectors of the economy. 2
Estimates of Costs/Cost Savings
The analyses of 34 policy options included estimates of the direct cost of those policies, in terms
of both net costs or cost savings during 2011–2030, and a dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., costeffectiveness). The estimated costs used in these analyses of the policy options were based on
data and assumptions available at the time and may need to be updated as the actions are
considered for implementation in the future. One of the policy options analyzed (ES-12) was
subsequently not approved by the KCACP as a policy recommendation. Following is a brief
summary of the approach used to estimate the costs or cost savings associated with the policy
recommendations:
•

Discounted and annualized costs or cost savings—Standard approaches were taken here. The
net present value of costs or cost savings was calculated by applying a real discount rate of
5%. Dollars-per-ton estimates were derived as an annualized cost per ton, dividing the
present value cost or savings by the cumulative GHG reduction measured in tons. As was the
case with GHG reductions, the period 2011–2030 was analyzed.

•

Cost savings—Total net costs or savings were estimated by comparing monetized costs and savings of
policy implementation over time, using discounting. These net costs could be positive or

2

A production-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services produced
within the state, and a consumption-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and
services consumed within the state. In some sectors of the economy, these two approaches may not result
in significantly different numbers. However, the power sector is notable, in that it is responsible for large
quantities of GHG emissions, and states often produce more or less electricity than they consume (with
the remainder attributable to power exports or imports). Kentucky has historically been a net exporter of
electricity, due in large part to the relative low cost of coal-generated power. Reference Case projections
of electricity production for 2008 through 2030 indicate that Kentucky will remain a net exporter of
electricity. Emissions from net electricity exports are projected to increase over the 2008–2030 period,
from 4.1 MMtCO2e in 2008 to 5.7 MMtCO2e in 2030, however as a percent of total generation exports
are expected to average just over 4%. Both consumption and production based emissions are presented;
however, this plan will rely upon the consumption-based approach for projection and analysis of
recommended policies.

1-6

negative; negative costs indicated that the policy saved money or produced “cost savings.”
Many policies were estimated to create net financial cost savings (typically through fuel
savings and electricity savings associated with new policy actions). It is important to note
that some of the policy options with an estimated cost savings are likely to require significant
up-front capital investments.
•

Direct vs. indirect effects—Estimates of costs and cost savings were based on “direct effects”
(i.e., those borne by the entities implementing the policy). Implementing entities could be
individuals, companies, and/or government agencies. In contrast, conventional cost-benefit
analysis takes the “societal perspective,” and tallies every conceivable impact on every entity
in society (and quantifies these wherever possible).

Additional Costs and Benefits 3
The KCAPC recommendations were guided by four decision criteria that included: GHG
reductions, monetized costs/savings of various policies, other potential co-benefits and costs
(e.g., social, economic, and environmental) and feasibility considerations. The TWGs were asked
to examine co-benefits and feasibility issues in qualitative terms where deemed important, and to
quantify the policy options on a case-by-case basis, as needed, depending on need and where
data were readily available.
Implementation Mechanisms
The analysis for each recommendation (see Appendices E through I) of the KCAPC includes
guidance on the policy instruments or “mechanisms” that were prescribed or assumed for the
policy action. This includes a range of potential mechanisms, such as funding incentives, codes
and standards, voluntary and negotiated agreements, market-based instruments, information and
education, and reporting and disclosure. In some cases, the recommended mechanisms are
precise; in others, they are more general and envision further work to develop concrete programs
and steps to achieve the goals recommended by the KCAPC.

Kentucky GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
In January 2010, CCS completed a draft GHG emissions inventory and reference case projection
to assist the KCAPC and TWGs in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG
emissions in Kentucky, and thereby inform the policy development process.4 The KCAPC and
TWGs reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and projections methodologies, as
well as alternative data and approaches for improving them. The KCAPC and TWGs were
provided opportunities to review and comment on the draft emissions inventory and forecast
report and did so. The inventory and reference case projections were revised to incorporate
changes approved by the KCAPC, and the revised report was subsequently approved by the
3

“Additional costs and benefits” were defined as those borne by entities other than those implementing
the policy recommendation. These indirect effects were quantified on a case-by-case basis, depending on
magnitude, importance, need, and availability of data.

KCAPC at its third meeting on June 2, 2010. 5 It is important to note that the analysis was done
2009- 2010 and recent announcements by utilities and more recent actions by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency are not included in the 2010 I&F report.
The inventory and reference case projections included detailed coverage of all economic sectors
and GHGs in Kentucky, including future emission trends and assessment issues related to
energy, the economy, and population growth. These assessment issues included estimates of total
statewide “gross emissions” on a production basis for all sources and on a consumption basis for
the electricity sector. (See prior discussion under “Analysis of Policy Recommendations” in this
chapter for an explanation of the production versus consumption approach.) The issues involved
in developing the inventory and reference case projections are summarized in Chapter 2
(Inventory and Forecast of GHG Emissions) and are discussed in detail in the final report for the
inventory and reference case projections. 6
The GHG emissions inventory and reference case projections cover the six types of gases
included in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Inventory: CO2, methane, nitrous oxide,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric—CO2 equivalence (CO2e)—that indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential-weighted basis. 7
The inventory and reference case projections revealed substantial emission growth rates and
related mitigation challenges. Figure 1-2 shows the reference case projections for Kentucky’s
gross GHG emissions as rising fairly steeply to 247.7 MMtCO2e by 2030, growing by 81% over
1990 levels. Figure 1-2 also provides the sectoral breakdown of projected GHG emissions.
The inventory and reference case projections of Kentucky’s GHG emissions provided the
following critical findings:
•

The principal sources of Kentucky’s GHG emissions are electricity consumption,
transportation, and RCI fuel use, accounting for 50%, 20%, and 17% of Kentucky’s gross
GHG emissions in 2005, respectively.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers among the
atmosphere, space, land, and oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a
simple measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system (IPCC, 2001). Holding
everything else constant, increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive
radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth). See: Boucher, O., et al.

Estimates of carbon sinks within Kentucky’s forests and soils, including urban forests, landuse changes, and agricultural soil cultivation practices, are included in this report. The
current estimates indicate that about 7.6 MMtCO2e of emissions were stored in Kentucky
biomass in 2005. This leads to net emissions of about 176 MMtCO2e in Kentucky in 2005, an
amount equal to 2.8% of total U.S. net GHG emissions.

•

The use of coal has led to low electricity rates in Kentucky compared to the rest of the
country, which has allowed energy-intensive industries, which provide valuable goods and
services beyond the borders of Kentucky to flourish in the state, as acknowledged in
Kentucky’s Energy Plan. 8

While Kentucky’s estimated emissions growth rate presents challenges, it also provides major
opportunities. Key choices regarding technologies and infrastructure can have a significant
impact on emissions growth in Kentucky. The KCAPC’s recommendations document the
opportunities for the state to reduce its GHG emissions, while continuing its strong economic
growth by being more energy efficient, using more renewable energy sources, and increasing the
use of cleaner transportation modes, technologies, and fuels.

Notes: Res/Com = residential and commercial fuel use sectors; emissions for the residential, commercial, and
industrial fuel use sectors are associated with the direct use of fuels (natural gas, petroleum, coal, and wood) to
provide space heating, water heating, process heating, cooking, and other energy end-uses. The commercial sector
accounts for emissions associated with the direct use of fuels by, for example, hospitals, schools, government
buildings (local, county, and state), and other commercial establishments. The industrial processes sector accounts
for emissions associated with manufacturing and excludes emissions included in the industrial fuel use sector. The
transportation sector accounts for emissions associated with fuel consumption by all on-road and non-highway
vehicles. Non-highway vehicles include jet aircraft, gasoline-fueled piston aircraft, railway locomotives, boats, and
ships. Emissions from non-highway agricultural and construction equipment are included in the industrial sector.
Electricity = electricity generation sector emissions on a consumption basis (including emissions associated with
electricity imported from outside of Kentucky and excluding emissions associated with electricity exported from
Kentucky to other states).

KCAPC Policy Recommendations (Beyond Recent Actions)
The KCAPC recommended 46 policy actions. Figure 1-4 presents a graphical summary of the
potential cumulative emission reductions associated with the recent federal actions and the 33
policy recommendations relative to the BAU reference case projections. Table 1-2 provides the
numeric estimates underlying Figure 1-4. In Figure 1-4:

•

The red line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2015,
2020, 2025 and 2030) levels of Kentucky’ gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis.
(The consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Kentucky to meet the state’s demand for electricity.) The red line for 2010–
2030 includes projected emissions associated with recent federal and state actions that were
analyzed quantitatively.

•

The black line with blue diamonds portrays the reference case projections for 2010-2030 if
no recent actions or additional policy options were enacted- the Business as Usual (BAU)
scenario.

•

The green line shows the projected GHG emission levels associated with the KCAPC’s
recommendation for Kentucky to adopt a statewide, economy-wide GHG reduction goal to
reduce the state’s gross GHG emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by 2030. Together, if the
33 quantified policy recommendations and the recent federal and state actions (or their
equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2030 emission reduction goal would be
virtually achieved, based on results of analysis of KCAPC proposals conducted through the
KCAPC and TWG process. (Note that other KCAPC recommendations would have the effect
of reducing emissions, but those reductions were not analyzed quantitatively, so are not
reflected in the green line.)

Table 1-3 depicts a summary by sector of the estimated GHG reductions and costs/savings of
implementing the KCAPC recommended policies, after being adjusted for overlaps. It is
important to note that some of the policy options with an estimated cost savings are likely to
require significant up-front capital investments. For the policies recommended by the KCAPC to
yield the levels of estimated emission reductions shown in Table 1-3, they must be implemented
in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.

of this report provide documentation of how sector-level emission reductions and costs (or cost savings) were
adjusted to eliminate double counting associated with overlaps between policies.

Table 1-4 on the following pages summarizes the policy options analyzed and approved by the
KCAPC, with one exception (ES-12), as recommendations to be included in this report. The
sector tables below match the cover pages of each of the TWG appendices (E, F, G, H, and I).
Each of the segments of the table portrays the policy recommendations, projected GHG emission
reductions, the net present value costs or cost savings and the cost-effectiveness of each policy
option. The detailed narrative explaining each policy option is included in the respective
appendices to this report.
It is acknowledged that the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) participated in
discussing the policy recommendations. However, the KPSC abstained from taking a position for
or against any policy recommendation that could come before it in an adjudicated proceeding. It
is also acknowledged that the KPSC may need additional statutory authority to consider some of
the policy recommendations.

The benefits of increased forest carbon sequestration will last far beyond the policy period. When GHG
reductions and cost-effectiveness are calculated considering the lifetime of the forest (~50 years), the
results are 3.3 MMtCO2e and 5.3 $/tCO2e, respectively.

Negative values in the Net Present Value (NPV) and the Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings.
Negative NPV represents positive net cash flows from the policy recommendation (the costs of the policy, i.e., new
energy efficiency equipment (air conditioners, furnaces, etc.), when levelized over their expected lifetimes, are less
than expected energy expenditures. Policy recommendations with estimated cost savings still are likely to require
significant up-front capital investment for the new energy efficiency equipment.

N/A = not applicable; PBF = Public Benefit Fund.
GHG reductions are calculated for each year (columns three and four above) and the cumulative for 2010–2030
(column five).
The cost per tCO2e (column seven) over 2010–2030 is the discounted, net present value of the 2010–2030 cash
flows in millions of dollars (column six) divided by the cumulative MMtCO2e of GHG reductions (column five).

*This analysis reflects the use of full-fuel-cycle GHG emission factors.
On October 27, 2010, the RCI Technical Work Group (TWG) discussed the issue of direct versus “full-fuel-cycle”
emission factors. Full-fuel-cycle GHG emission factors include the GHG emissions associated with the production,
processing, transmission, and distribution of fuels and electricity. These “upstream” emissions associated with energy
supply are 5%–25% greater than direct, or end-use, emission factors that are calculated as a result of fuel
combustion at the power station or building. On the October 27 call, the RCI TWG decided to present the summary
table above showing GHG emissions and cost-effectiveness based on full-fuel-cycle emission factors. The work
group also decided that the results for each RCI policy recommendation should show both direct and full fuel cycle
emissions factors. On balance, the difference in 2011–2030 cumulative GHG reductions is about 10% between the
two methodologies. The choice of emission factor does not impact the net present value calculations. However,
because cumulative 2011–2030 GHG emission reductions are increased under full-fuel-cycle emission factors, the
$/ton cost-effectiveness estimates will differ modestly between the two methodologies.

The cost analysis provides figures that represent the net of both positive up-front costs and cost savings
over time. Data results that indicate the potential for net cost savings should be viewed with an
understanding that in some cases, initial up-front costs may be necessary in order to achieve the net cost
savings over time.

Perspectives on Policy Recommendations
As explained above, the KCAPC considered the estimates of the GHG reductions that could be
achieved and the costs (or cost savings) of 33 of its recommendations. Figure 1-5 presents the
estimated tons of GHG emission reductions for each policy recommendation for which estimates
were quantified, expressed as a cumulative figure for the period 2011–2030 based on the
assumptions and data from 2010/2011. In addition to the imprecision in GHG reductions
achieved by each policy recommendation, there are uncertainties about the exact cost (or cost
savings) per ton of reduction achieved.

Negative values represent net cost savings, and positive values represent net costs associated with the policy
recommendations. It is important to note that some of the policy options with an estimated cost savings are likely to
require significant up-front capital investments.

Figure 1-7 presents a step-wise marginal cost curve for Kentucky. The horizontal (x) axis
represents the percentage of GHG emission reductions in 2030 for each policy recommendation
relative to the BAU forecast. The vertical axis represents the marginal cost of mitigation
(expressed as the cost-effectiveness of each policy recommendation on a cumulative basis,
2011–2030). In the figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual policy. The width of
the segment indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the recommendation in
percentage terms. The height of the segment relative to the vertical axis shows the average cost
(or saving) of reducing one tCO2e of GHG emissions with the application of the
recommendation. Note that recommendation steps appearing below the “$0” line near the middle
of the graph (on the vertical axis) are cost-saving measures, while the recommendations above
this line have positive net direct costs.

Chapter 2
Inventory and Projections of GHG Emissions
Introduction
This chapter summarizes Kentucky3s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks (carbon
storage) from 1990 to 2030. The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared a draft of
Kentucky3s GHG emissions inventory and reference case projections for the Kentucky Energy
and Environment Cabinet (KEEC) and the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC).
The draft inventory and reference case projections, completed in January 2010, provided KEEC
and the KCAPC with an initial, comprehensive understanding of current and possible future
GHG emissions. The draft report was provided to the KCAPC and its Technical Work Groups
(TWGs) to assist them in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG emissions in
Kentucky, and thereby inform the policy recommendation development process. The KCAPC
and TWGs have reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and methodologies, as
well as alternative data and approaches for improving the draft GHG inventory and forecast. The
inventory and reference case forecast have since been revised to address the comments provided
by the KCAPC. The information in this chapter reflects the information presented in the Final
Kentucky Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections report (hereafter referred
to as the Inventory and Projections report). 1
Historical GHG emission estimates (1990 through 2007) 2 were developed using a set of
generally accepted principles and guidelines for state GHG emissions, relying to the extent
possible on Kentucky-specific data and inputs when it was possible to do so. The reference case
projections (2008T2030) are based on a compilation of various projections of electricity
generation, fuel use, and other GHG-emitting activities for Kentucky, along with a set of simple,
transparent assumptions described in the final Inventory and Projections report. It is important to
note that the analysis was done in 2009T2010, and recent announcements by utilities and more
recent actions by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are not included.
The Inventory and Projections report covers the six types of gases included in the U.S. GHG
inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric\CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential-weighted basis. 3

The last year of available historical data varies by sector, ranging from 2004 to 2008.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the EarthTatmosphere system. Holding everything else constant,
increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the
absorption of energy by the Earth). See: Boucher, O., et al. "Radiative Forcing of Climate Change." Chapter 6 in
Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Contribution of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on
2-1

It is important to note that the emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with the
electricity sources used to meet Kentucky’s demands, corresponding to a consumption-based
approach to emissions accounting. Another way to look at electricity emissions is to consider the
GHG emissions produced by electricity generation facilities in the state\a production-based
method. The study covers both methods of accounting for emissions, but for consistency, all total
results are reported as consumption-based.

Kentucky GHG Emissions: Sources and Trends
Table 2-1 provides a summary of GHG emissions estimated for Kentucky by sector for 1990,
2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030. As shown in this table, Kentucky is estimated to
be a net source of GHG emissions (positive, or gross, emissions). Kentucky3s forested landscape,
urban forestry, land use, and the cultivation of agricultural soils serve as sinks of GHG emissions
(removal of emissions, or negative emissions). Kentucky3s net emissions subtract the equivalent
GHG reduction from emission sinks from the gross GHG emission totals. The following sections
discuss GHG emission sources and sinks, trends, projections, and uncertainties.

Historical Emissions
Overview
In 2005, on a gross emissions consumption basis (i.e., excluding carbon sinks), activities in
Kentucky accounted for approximately 183 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2e emissions, an
amount equal to 2.6% of total U.S. gross GHG emissions. On a net emissions basis (i.e.,
including carbon sinks), activities in Kentucky accounted for approximately 176 MMtCO2e of

2-3

emissions in 2005, an amount equal to 2.8% of total U.S. net GHG emissions. 4 Kentucky3s gross
GHG emissions are rising at a faster rate than those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005,
Kentucky3s gross GHG emissions increased by 34%, while national gross emissions rose by
16%.
On a per capita basis, Kentucky residents emitted about 37 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 1990,
much higher than the 1990 national per capita emissions of 25 tCO2e. Figure 2-1 illustrates the
State3s emissions per capita and per unit of economic output. 5 Unlike the national per capita
emissions, which remained nearly constant from 1990 to 2005, the Kentucky per capita
emissions increased by 19% from 1990 to 2005. The electricity supply sector shows the greatest
difference between per capita emissions in Kentucky and the nation, at 22 tCO2e per capita in
Kentucky for this sector, compared to 8 tCO2e per capita nationally. This is because the
electricity consumed in Kentucky relies on a high amount of coal in the generation fuel mix
relative to the nation as a whole\about 90% for Kentucky, versus 50% for the United States in
2005. The use of coal has led to low electricity rates in Kentucky compared to the rest of the
country, which has allowed energy-intensive industries to flourish in the state, as acknowledged
in Kentucky3s Energy Plan. 6 Like the nation as a whole, Kentucky3s economic growth exceeded
emissions growth throughout the 1990T2005 period (leading to declining estimates of GHG
emissions per unit of state product). From 1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross product
dropped by 11% in Kentucky and by about 26% nationally. 7
The principal sources of Kentucky3s GHG emissions in 2005 were electricity consumption;
transportation; and residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use. They accounted for
50%, 20%, and 17% of Kentucky3s gross GHG emissions, respectively, as shown in Figure 2-2.

Figure 2-2 shows agriculture and forest fires were the next-largest contributors of gross GHG
emissions in 2005, accounting for 4.7% of the 2005 gross GHG emissions in Kentucky. The
agriculture sector includes emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management,
agricultural soils, and agricultural burning. The fossil fuel industries and industrial processes
each accounted for about 3.6% of Kentucky3s gross GHG emissions in 2005. The fossil fuel
industry sector includes GHG emissions associated with natural gas production, processing,
transmission and distribution (T&D), and pipeline fuel use, as well as with oil production and
refining and coal mining. Industrial process emissions are dominated by CO2 releases in the
production of iron and steel and the use of HFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are rising rapidly through the historical and projection
periods due to the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting CFCs. 8
Other industrial sources of process CO2 emissions include lime production, cement production,
ammonia production, and the use of soda ash, limestone, dolomite, and urea. In addition, fugitive
SF6 is released during the use of electric power T&D equipment, while aluminum production is
responsible for the release of PFCs. Also, the waste management sector contributed CH4 and
N2O emissions, which accounted for 1.2% of total gross GHG emissions in Kentucky in 2005.
The waste management sector is dominated by CH4 fugitive emissions from landfills, but also
includes emissions from waste combustion and wastewater management.

8

Chlorofluorocarbons are also potent GHGs. However, they are not included in GHG estimates because of concerns
related to implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Affect the Ozone Layer. See Appendix I in
the final Inventory and Projections report for Kentucky (http://www.kyclimatechange.us/
Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm).

Estimates of carbon sinks in Kentucky include forested landscape, urban forests, land use
changes, and agricultural soil cultivation practices. Note that forest wildfires and prescribed
burning are sources of GHG emissions that were included with the agriculture sector in Figure
2-2. Forestry activities and agricultural soil cultivation practices in Kentucky are estimated to be
net sinks of GHG emissions in all years. The current estimates indicate that about 7.6 MMtCO2e
were stored in Kentucky biomass in 2005. This leads to net emissions of 176 MMtCO2e in
Kentucky in 2005, an amount equal to 2.8% of total U.S. net GHG emissions.

Reference Case Projections (Business as Usual)
Relying on a variety of sources for projections, as noted in the Inventory and Projections report,
a simple reference case projection of GHG emissions through 2030 was developed. As illustrated
in Figure 2-3 and shown numerically in Table 2-1, under the reference case projections,
2-6

Kentucky3s gross GHG emissions continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 248 MMtCO2e by
2030, or 81% above 1990 levels. This equates to a 1.2% annual rate of growth from 2005 to
2030. Relative to 2005, the shares of emissions associated with electricity consumption,
transportation, and industrial processes increase to 54%, 23%, and 5%, respectively, in 2030.
The shares of emissions from the RCI fuel use, fossil fuel industries, waste management, and
agriculture sectors all decrease by 2030, relative to 2005, to 11%, 3%, 0.8%, and 3%,
respectively.

Emissions associated with electricity consumption are projected to be the largest contributor to
future GHG emissions growth, followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector,
as shown in Figure 2-4. Other sources of emissions growth include the increasing use of HFCs
and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in refrigeration, air conditioning, and
other applications, other industrial processes, and the fossil fuel industry. Table 2-2 summarizes
the growth rates that drive the growth in the Kentucky reference case projections, as well as the

A Closer Look at the Three Major Sources: Electricity Consumption,
Transportation, and RCI Fuel Use
As shown in Figure 2-2, electricity use in 2005 accounted for 50% of Kentucky3s gross GHG
emissions (about 91MMtCO2e), which was higher than the national average share of emissions
from electricity generation (34%).9 On a per capita basis, Kentucky3s GHG emissions from
electricity consumption are higher than the national average (in 2005, 22 tCO2e per capita in
Kentucky, versus 8 tCO2e per capita nationally). Electricity generation in Kentucky is dominated
9

For the United States as a whole, there is relatively little difference between the emissions from electricity use and
emissions from electricity production, as the US imports only about 1% of its electricity, and exports even less.

2-8

by steam units, which are primarily fueled by coal. In 2005, 90% of Kentucky3s electricity
generation was provided by coal-fired units, compared to 50% for the nation. Throughout the
historical and forecasted periods, Kentucky power plant generation exceeds the electricity
consumed in the state. The remaining electricity generated in Kentucky is assumed to be
exported to neighboring regions.
As noted above, these electricity emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with
the electricity sources used to meet Kentucky3s demand for electricity, corresponding to a
consumption-based approach to emissions accounting. In 2005, emissions associated with
Kentucky3s electricity consumption (91 MMtCO2e) were about 7.5 MMtCO2e lower than those
associated with electricity production (98 MMtCO2e). The higher level for production-based
emissions reflects GHG emissions associated with net exports of electricity to other states and to
neighboring regions. 10 Projections of electricity sales for 2008 through 2030 indicate that
Kentucky will remain a net exporter of electricity. Emissions from net electricity exports are
projected to increase over the 2008T2030 period, from 4.1 MMtCO2e in 2008 to 5.7 MMtCO2e
in 2030. Overall, the reference case projection indicates that production-based emissions
(associated with electricity generated in-state) will increase by about 42 MMtCO2e from 2005
levels, and consumption-based emissions (associated with electricity consumed in-state) will
increase by about 43 MMtCO2e from 2005 to 2030.
While estimates are provided for emissions from both electricity production and consumption,
unless otherwise indicated, tables, figures, and totals in this report reflect electricity consumption
emissions. The consumption-based approach can better reflect the emissions (and emission
reductions) associated with activities occurring in the state, particularly with respect to electricity
use (and efficiency improvements), and is particularly useful for decision making. Under this
approach, emissions associated with electricity exported to other states would need to be covered
in those states3 inventories in order to avoid double counting or exclusions.
Like electricity emissions, GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily from
1990 to 2005, at an average annual growth rate of 2.1%. In 2005, gasoline-powered on-road
vehicles accounted for about 52% of transportation GHG emissions. On-road diesel vehicles
accounted for another 26% of transportation GHG emissions, and marine vessels for roughly
10%. Air travel, rail, and other sources (natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles
used in transport applications) accounted for the remaining 13% of transportation emissions. As
a result of Kentucky3s population and economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles
traveled (VMT), emissions from on-road gasoline use grew by 17% from 1990 to 2005.
Meanwhile, emissions from on-road diesel use rose by 66% during that period, suggesting rapid
growth in freight movement within the state. Emissions from transportation fuels are projected to
rise at a rate of 1.7% per year during 2005T2030, leading to an increase of 20 MMtCO2e in
transportation emissions. The largest percentage increase in emissions over this 2005T2030
period is seen in on-road diesel fuel consumption, which is projected to increase by 129%, with
total transportation emissions expected to reach 57 MMtCO2e by 2030.

10

Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in-state and out-of-state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimate reflects some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A of the Inventory and Projections report.

2-9

Activities in the RCI 11 sectors produce GHG emissions when fuels are combusted to provide
space heating, process heating, and other applications. In 2005, combustion of oil, natural gas,
coal, and wood in the RCI sectors contributed about 17% (about 31 MMtCO2e) of Kentucky3s
gross GHG emissions, below the RCI sectors3 contribution for the nation (22%). In 2005, the
residential sector3s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 13% (3.9 MMtCO2e),
the commercial sector3s share was 10% (3.1 MMtCO2e), and the industrial sector3s share was
77% (24 MMtCO2e). Overall, emissions from the RCI sectors (excluding those associated with
electricity consumption) are expected to decrease by 11% between 2005 and 2030 to 28
MMtCO2e. Emissions from the residential sector are projected to increase slightly by 0.8% from
2005 to 2030. In contrast, emissions from the commercial and industrial sectors are expected to
decrease by 12% and 13%, respectively, from 2005 to 2030.

KCAPC Revisions
The KCAPC made the following revisions to the inventory and reference case projections, which
explain the differences between the final Inventory and Projections report and the draft initial
assessment completed in January 2010:
•

Electricity Supply:


The electricity sales forecast was changed from relying solely on the Energy Information
Administration3s Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (AEO 2009) forecast but was enhanced
with recent Kentucky utility forecasts provided to the Kentucky Public Service
Commission. On average, this resulted in an increase in the electricity sales growth rate
from about 0.5%/year to about 1.5%/year over the 2007T2030 period. The projections do
not account for utility actions to comply with new or pending EPA regulations.



The amount of on-site electricity use was changed from reliance on the low levels
assumed in AEO 2009 to higher levels more consistent with Kentucky3s experience and
industry standards. On average, this resulted in an increase in parasitic load from about
0.5% of total electricity production to 7% for coal stations and 2% for natural gas-fired
and oil-fired power stations.



There were several typos in the original report denoting limportsm; these have since been
corrected to lexports.m

o The uncertainty section was revised to address the issue of Kentucky-specific versus
regional assumptions.
•

RCI Fuel Use: The changes discussed above for the electricity supply sector affecting the
changes in the electricity sales forecast also have an impact on how the electricity emissions
are allocated among the RCI sectors. This is reflected in Appendix B. In addition, a figure
was added showing the breakout of RCI emissions by RCI sector and fuel type.

•

Transportation: The KCAPC did not recommend any changes to the reference case
transportation projections at this time. However, the KCAPC did recommend reviewing
alternative VMT projections. In response to this request, Appendix C of the final Inventory

11

The industrial sector includes emissions associated with agricultural energy use and fuel used by the fossil fuel
production industry.

2-10

and Projections report presents the Kentucky transportation emissions under an alternative
VMT growth scenario, in which VMT growth follows projected population growth.
Transportation emissions in the front section of the Inventory and Projections report are
unchanged from those reported in the draft report.
•

Waste Management:


The landfill emissions were revised based on waste emplacement, flaring, and landfill
gas-to-energy data from Kentucky3s Solid Waste Division.



There is no in-state controlled waste combustion, so default emissions for that category
were removed.

o No industrial wastewater data were available for key industries, such as bourbon
production, so industrial wastewater emissions remained unchanged from the draft
version.

Key Uncertainties
Some data gaps exist in this inventory, and particularly in the reference case projections. Key
tasks for future refinement of this inventory and forecast include review and revision of key
drivers, such as the transportation, electricity demand, and RCI fuel use growth rates that will be
major determinants of Kentucky3s future GHG emissions (see Table 2-2 and Figure 2-4). These
growth rates are driven by uncertain economic, demographic, and land use trends (including
growth patterns and transportation system impacts), all of which deserve closer review and
discussion.

2-11

Chapter 3
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Sectors
Sector Overview
Overview of GHG Emissions
The agriculture, forestry, and waste (AFW) sectors are responsible for moderate amounts of
Kentucky’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The total AFW contribution to carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) gross emissions in 2005 was 11 million metric tons (MMt), or about 6%
of the state’s total. It is important to note that the AFW emissions include only non-energy sources,
as described further below, and exclude combustion-related GHGs, such as diesel fuel
consumption in the agriculture sector. These fuel combustion emissions are included as part of the
industrial fuel combustion sector (and are covered in the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial
[RCI] Sectors chapter). The AFW contribution to net emissions in 2005 is 2% of the state’s total,
after accounting for forestry and agricultural sinks.
Agricultural emissions include methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from enteric
(intestinal) fermentation, 1 storage and treatment of livestock manure (e.g., in compost piles or
anaerobic treatment lagoons), 2 agricultural soils, 3 and agriculture residue burning. Figure 3-1
shows Kentucky’s historic and projected GHG emissions from sources in the agriculture sector for
1990 through 2030. As shown in Figure 3-1, emissions from soil carbon losses from agricultural
soils, livestock soils, manure management, enteric fermentation, and fertilizer application all make
significant contributions to the sector totals. Emissions include CO2 emissions from oxidized soil
carbon, application of urea, and application of lime. Sector emissions also include N2O emissions
resulting from activities that increase nitrogen in the soil, such as fertilizer (synthetic and livestock
manure) application, production of nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes), and agricultural burning
activity.
1

Methane emissions from enteric fermentation are the result of normal digestive processes in ruminant and nonruminant livestock. Microbes in the animal digestive system break down food and emit CH4 as a by-product. More
CH4 is produced in ruminant livestock because of digestive activity in the large fore-stomach.

2

Methane and N2O emissions from the storage and treatment of livestock manure (e.g., in compost piles or anaerobic
treatment lagoons) occur as a result of manure decomposition. The environmental conditions of decomposition drive
the relative magnitude of emissions. In general, the more anaerobic the conditions are, the more CH4 is produced,
because decomposition is aided by CH4-producing bacteria that thrive in oxygen-limited anaerobic conditions. Under
aerobic conditions, N2O emissions are dominant. Emission estimates from manure management are based on manure
that is stored and treated in livestock operations. Emissions from manure that is applied to agricultural soils as an
amendment or deposited directly to pasture and grazing land by grazing animals are accounted for in the agricultural
soils emissions.
3

The management of agricultural soils can result in N2O emissions and net fluxes of CO2, causing emissions or sinks.
In general, soil amendments that add nitrogen to soils can also result in N2O emissions. Nitrogen additions drive
underlying soil nitrification and denitrification cycles, which produce N2O as a by-product. Agricultural soil emissions
also account for decomposition of crop residues, synthetic and organic fertilizer application, manure application,
sewage sludge, nitrogen fixation, and histosols (high organic soils, such as wetlands or peatlands) cultivation. Both
direct and indirect emissions of N2O occur from the application of manure, fertilizer, and sewage sludge to agricultural
soils. Direct emissions occur at the site of application, and indirect emissions occur when nitrogen leaches to
groundwater or in surface water runoff and is transported off site before entering the nitrification/denitrification cycle.

3-1

Relative to other sectors, Kentucky's agriculture sector contributes relatively low amounts of GHG
emissions to total statewide emissions. In 2005, the agriculture sector contributed about 7.9
MMtCO2e emissions (4%) to Kentucky’s total statewide gross GHG emissions (consumption
basis). Within the agriculture sector, agricultural soil management accounted for the largest source
of emissions, representing 54% of gross agricultural emissions. The contributions of other
agricultural sources to total agricultural emissions include livestock enteric fermentation (40%),
manure management (7%), and burning of agricultural crop waste (<1%). Soil cultivation practices
represent a net sink, sequestering approximately 1.1 MMtCO2e.
As shown in Figure 3-1, since 2000, agriculture sector emissions have remained fairly constant
through 2010, and are expected to decline slightly through 2030. Overall, emissions for the
agriculture sector are expected to decrease slightly, by about 0.37 MMtCO2e (approximately
6.8%), from 2000 to 2030. In 2030, the proportional contribution of each agriculture sector to total
agricultural source emissions is expected to change slightly relative to its contribution in 2000. In
2030, agricultural soil management is expected to account for 45% of gross agricultural emissions,
while livestock enteric fermentation is projected to contribute 48%, manure management about
6%, and burning of agricultural crop waste less than 1% of gross agricultural emissions. Soil
cultivation practices are expected to continue as a net sink, sequestering approximately 1.1
MMtCO2e.

Forestry and land use emissions refer to the net CO2 flux 4 from forested lands in Kentucky. The
inventory is divided into two primary subsectors: the forested landscape and urban forestry and
land use. Both subsectors capture net carbon sequestered in forest biomass, urban trees, landfills,
and harvested wood products. In addition, other GHG sources, such as N2O emissions from
fertilizer application in urban areas and CH4 and N2O emissions from prescribed burns and
wildfires, are included.
On a net basis, Kentucky's forestry and land use sector is responsible for sequestering moderate
amounts of carbon. In 2005, the sequestration in Kentucky from land use change and forestry was
about 5.8 MMtCO2e. The number of metric tons sequestered from forestry is equivalent to
approximately 3% of the state's gross GHG emissions (consumption basis) from all sectors. Table

In Kentucky, the waste sector produces a low amount of GHG emissions. Figure 3-2 shows
historical and projected GHG emissions from sources in the waste sector. Emissions from waste
management consist largely of CH4 emitted from landfills, while emissions from wastewater
treatment include both CH4 and N2O. Emissions are also included for MSW combustion. Note that
due to data limitations, the emission estimates do not include methane emitted from about 50
landfills closed between 1992 and 1995. While some additional methane emissions are expected,
given the age of the waste in place at these sites, the additional CO2e is not expected to be
significant.
Overall, the waste management sector accounted for about 2.2 MMtCO2e of GHG emissions, or
about 1.2% of Kentucky’s total gross emissions on a consumption basis. In 2030, gross GHG
emissions for the sector are estimated to be about 2.1 MMtCO2e, accounting for less than 1% of
the state’s total gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis. Most important, the emission
estimates for managing solid waste do not capture the upstream emissions embedded in the waste
materials. In the Center for Climate Change’s experience, those emissions are often an order of
magnitude higher than the subsequent waste management emissions. Hence, policy
recommendations like AFW-8, which target MSW reuse and recycling, are needed to address those
upstream emissions.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Agriculture
Opportunities for GHG mitigation in the agriculture sector include measures that can reduce
emissions within this sector and other sectors. Within the agriculture sector, changes in crop
cultivation can reduce GHG emissions by building soil carbon (indirectly sequestering carbon
from the atmosphere) or through more efficient nutrient application (reducing both direct N2O
emissions and embedded GHG emissions within those nutrients). The implementation of improved
farming and harvesting techniques, as well as utilization of biomass for fuel, has the potential to
reduce future emissions relative to current emissions from this sector and other sectors, such as
electricity and transportation. On-farm energy expenses can also be reduced at the same time. In
addition to the potential cost savings and GHG benefits from the Kentucky Climate Action Plan
Council (KCAPC) recommendations discussed in the following section, the implementation of
these measures may serve to sustain the viability of farming in Kentucky by preserving the quality
and value of agricultural lands.
The foremost challenge facing the implementation of these policies in the agriculture sector is
breaking any economic barriers that are preventing (or not properly incentivizing) farmers in
Kentucky from undertaking these measures. Another challenge will be to ensure participation in
new energy opportunities as commercial-scale technology matures during the policy period (e.g.,
cellulosic ethanol production facilities locating within the state).
Forestry
Kentucky has significant opportunity for increased carbon sequestration in the forestry sector. The
principal means to reduce emissions in these areas are:

3-4

•

Adopting management practices to increase carbon sequestration in forestlands;

•

Increasing the area of forestland through reforestation, afforestation, and restoration of mined
lands and other non-forested lands; and

•

Utilizing forest biomass for energy production.

Enhanced management of the state’s forests can lead to higher levels of carbon sequestration. Such
enhancement can be achieved through afforestation projects and enhanced stocking in existing
forests.
Actions taken within the forestry sector can also lead to GHG reductions in other sectors. The
establishment of woody crops for producing biomass energy feedstocks can replace fossil fuel
consumption, including transportation fuels and fuels used to produce electricity or steam in the
energy supply sector.
Kentucky faces several key challenges in the forestry sector. Similar to that mentioned for
agricultural biomass above, one challenge is providing incentives to produce and utilize wood
energy sources, especially before additional demand is put in place (e.g., cellulosic ethanol or other
biofuels derived from forest biomass). Another challenge is to encourage private forest landowners
to enroll in forestry management programs (e.g., until incentives, such as carbon offset programs
in other parts of the United States, provide a revenue stream). A continuing challenge in
Kentucky—as in most states—is ensuring funding for new forestry programs. Kentucky also has a
large number of acres that have been mined and need to be prepped and treated before forest stands
can be planted.
Waste Management
Opportunities for improvements in Kentucky’s waste management sector include measures that
can reduce emissions from both solid and liquid wastes. Improvements could include diversion of
solid waste from landfills, increased methane collection at landfills, and more efficient municipal
wastewater collection and treatment. Those approaches reduce the direct emissions associated with
the management of the waste. However, more significant emission reductions can be achieved by
reducing the amount of waste generated or by recycling waste, since these approaches reduce the
upstream emissions associated with production and transport of waste materials and packaging.
Often, those reductions are achieved in other sectors and in areas outside of the state.
Kentucky’s challenges in the waste management sector center on identifying funding to finance
capital improvements, providing incentives to encourage private entities to make technology
upgrades (e.g., composting programs), and identifying resources for municipalities and counties to
increase solid waste reuse and recycling programs.

Overview of Work Plan Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The AFW Technical Work Group (TWG) developed nine policy recommendations for the
Secretary’s review (see Table 3-2) that were then reviewed, revised, and ultimately approved by
the KCAPC members present and voting. This set of nine policies for the AFW sectors offers the
potential for major economic benefits and emission reductions. Implementing these policy
recommendations could lead to emission reductions of:

3-5

•

7.9 MMtCO2e per year by 2030, and

•

90 MMtCO2e cumulative from 2011 through 2030, after adjusting for overlaps with other
sectors.

The weighted-average cost-effectiveness of the recommended policies is about $3/tCO2e. This
average value includes policies that have both much lower and much higher likely costs per ton.
The nine policy recommendations for the AFW sectors address a diverse array of activities
capturing emission reductions both within and outside of these sectors (e.g., energy consumption
in the energy supply [ES] and transportation and land use [TLU] sectors). The estimated impacts
of the individual policies are shown in Table 3-2. The KCAPC policy recommendations are
described briefly here and in more detail in Appendix E of this report. The recommendations not
only result in significant emission reductions, but also offer a host of additional benefits, including
protection of biodiversity, enhanced forest aesthetics, watershed protection, reduced local air
pollution, economic development, and job growth. To yield the levels of savings described here,
the recommended policies need to be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
The following are primary opportunities for GHG mitigation identified by the KCAPC:
•

Agricultural crop production: Programs can be implemented with growers to utilize
cultivation practices that build soil carbon and reduce nutrient consumption. By building soil
carbon, CO2 is indirectly sequestered from the atmosphere. New technologies in the area of onfarm efficiency offer opportunities to reduce on-farm fossil fuel consumption.

•

Production of biomass for energy feedstocks: Kentucky has significant opportunities to
produce biomass from AFW feedstock sources. The use of renewable fuels, such as ethanol
from crop residue and forestry biomass and biodiesel from waste vegetable oils, can produce
significant reductions when they are used to offset consumption of fossil fuels (e.g., gasoline
and diesel in transportation and other combustion sources). This is particularly true when these
fuels are produced using processes and/or feedstocks that have much lower fossil fuel inputs
than those from conventional sources (sometimes referred to as “advanced” or “nextgeneration” biofuels). The goals to produce biomass feedstocks for energy are linked to
recommendations in ES-1, ES-5, ES-7, and TLU-10.

•

Enhancement/protection of forest carbon sinks: Through a variety of programs, enhanced
levels of CO2 sequestration can be achieved and carbon can be stored in the state’s forest
biomass. These include afforestation 5 projects, reforestation programs (restocking of poorly
stocked forests, including previously mined lands), and forest management initiatives.

•

Changes in MSW management practices: By promoting waste reuse, advanced MSW
recycling practices, improved organics management, and increased collection and utilization of
landfill methane, solid waste managers can reduce the GHG emissions associated with
collecting, transporting, and managing MSW. The reuse and recycling components would also
reduce the embedded GHG emissions of MSW, which tend to be much more significant than
the waste management emissions themselves. The emissions reduced in this sector would come
from in-state waste management practices and waste transport; as well as from upstream

(embedded) GHGs in the electricity supply, RCI, and transportation sectors both within and
outside of the state. Current data limitations do not allow for a precise breakout of the in-state
versus out-of-state reductions in embedded emissions.

The benefits of increased forest carbon sequestration will last far beyond the policy period. When GHG reductions
and cost-effectiveness are calculated considering the lifetime of the forest (~50 years), the results are 3.3 MMtCO2e

Totals do not equal the sum of individual policy recommendations due to subtraction of overlaps.

Overlap Discussion
The amount of GHG emissions reduced or sequestered and the costs of a policy recommendation
within the AFW sectors in some cases overlap with other AFW policies or policies in other sectors.
For the KCAPC recommendations in AFW, overlap occurs between AFW-8 and AFW-9 in the
waste management sector. One of the policy elements of AFW-8 covers enhanced management of
organic wastes in the MSW management sector. To the extent that these wastes are being diverted
from landfills to other waste management facilities (e.g., composting facilities), less organic waste
is available to generate landfill methane. This effect has been accounted for in the quantification of
AFW-9, which quantifies production of landfill gas and the associated methane emissions; hence,
the values shown for AFW-9 above assume successful implementation of AFW-8.
Overlap also occurs with some of the quantified benefits and costs of policy recommendations
from other sectors. Every effort has been made to determine where those overlaps occur and to
eliminate double counting of reductions. As displayed Table 3-2 above, the AFW sector totals
have been adjusted accordingly, as follows:
•

AFW-2 details the production of biomass feedstocks for electricity, heat, and steam production.
The GHG reductions associated with utilization of these feedstocks are accounted for in the
analyses of ES-1, ES-5, and ES-7.

•

AFW-3a is aimed toward the goal of producing biomass feedstocks to replace a percentage of
total Kentucky energy needs. The AFW Technical Work Group created an estimate of potential
biomass production in the state (detailed in Appendix E of this report, Table AFW-2 Biomass
Supply/Demand for Policy Recommendations), to ensure than biomass feedstocks were not
being double counted for electricity production and biofuels. The GHG reductions and costs
associated with actually using these feedstocks as fuels are accounted for in ES-1, ES-5, ES-7,
and TLU-10.

•

AFW-4 focuses on the production of biofuels from AFW feedstocks. Although the cost of
production of these biofuels is calculated in AFW-4, the final costs of using the fuels as well as
GHG reductions are accounted for in TLU-10.

•

AFW-6 is aimed at increasing agricultural production on abandoned, underutilized, and
reclaimed lands. The quantification of this policy assumes that these lands will be used to
produce agricultural products that can be used as biomass feedstocks for renewable fuels. Since
the use of these biomass feedstocks is accounted for in other sectors, the total GHG reductions
and costs of AFW-6 are subtracted from the AFW total.

3-8

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Sectors Policy Descriptions
The nine AFW policies recommended by the KCAPC include emission mitigation opportunities
related to the production and use of biomass energy; improved on-farm efficiency and carbon
sequestration; forestry management; increased use of abandoned, underutilized, reclaimed, and
previously mined lands for agricultural production and reforestation; and lower MSW emissions.
AFW-1.

Forestry Management for Carbon Sequestration

This policy addresses the potential for increasing carbon stocks in forests through practices that
increase the health and productivity of the forest. Forest improvements may include increasing tree
density, enhancing forest growth rates, altering rotation lengths, or decreasing the chances of
biomass loss from fires, pests, and disease. Increasing the transfer of biomass to long-term storage
in wood products can also enhance net carbon sequestration.
Managed forests can sequester more carbon than unmanaged forests for a number of reasons.
Practices may include management of rotation length, density, and ecosystem health, and
sustainable use of wood products. In addition, encouraging regeneration of existing forests through
stocking/planting and restoration practices (soil preparation, erosion control, etc.) can increase
carbon stocks above baseline levels and ensure conditions that support forest growth, particularly
after intense disturbances. Land participating in a certified management program may be eligible
to generate offset credits. 7 Note that not all private landowners who enroll in forest management
programs will have the goal of increased carbon sequestration. Landowner goals may include
increased harvesting productivity, wildlife management, hunting, aesthetic value, or other
objectives. Improvement of forest management results in side benefits, including watershed
protection, improved wildlife habitat, biodiversity conservation, and enhanced aesthetics and
recreation.
AFW-2.

Expanded Use of Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, and Steam Production

This policy dedicates a sustainable quantity of biomass from agricultural crops and residue,
forestry products, and MSW biomass resources for efficient conversion to energy and economical
production of heat, steam, or electricity. This biomass should be used in an environmentally
acceptable and sustainable manner. The objective is to create concurrent reduction of CO2 due to
displacement of fossil fuels, considering life-cycle GHG emissions associated with viable
collection, hauling, and energy conversion and distribution systems. The GHG reductions and
costs associated with this policy are accounted for in the energy supply sector in the ES-1 analysis.

7

Offset credits are awarded to GHG reduction projects that achieve measurable and verifiable emission reductions
through some action that is not considered business as usual practice. Offset credits (e.g., tCO2e/yr) can be sold to
entities seeking voluntary emission reductions or in some cases within mandatory systems (e.g., the California Cap &
Trade Program).
3-9

AFW-3a.

On-Farm Energy Production

This policy recommends increasing the productivity and conversion of crops, residues, and other
farm resources to meet the ES, TLU, and RCI needs. As the feedstocks will be used by other
sectors—TLU, RCI, and ES—the GHG reductions and costs/cost savings will be accounted for in
the sector where the biomass is utilized. Agricultural biomass production may encompass
herbaceous energy crops or woody energy crops, focusing on crops that are considered noninvasive. Underutilized agricultural land, abandoned lands, and reclaimed mine lands should be
considered for production of biomass.
AFW-3b.

On-Farm Energy Efficiency Improvements

This policy recommends improving energy conservation in agricultural operations. These
efficiency improvements would be achieved through technology upgrades to equipment and
facilities, displacement of fossil fuels with sustainable renewable fuels, improved watershed
planning, and promotion of on-farm and local energy sources. GHG reductions are realized when
farms reduce fossil fuel consumption. Possible on-farm energy improvements will vary, depending
on the size of and type of farm and technologies used on the farm. Energy audits will be necessary
to identify the improvements that would be most cost-effective.
AFW-4.

In-State Liquid/Gaseous Biofuels Production

This policy promotes sustainable in-state production and consumption of transportation biofuels
from agriculture, forestry, and MSW feedstocks to displace the use of gasoline and diesel. This
recommendation also promotes the in-state development of feedstocks, such as cellulosic material,
and production facilities to produce either liquid or gaseous biofuels with low carbon content.
Production of biomass for biofuel production must be done in a sustainable manner. The objective
is to create concurrent reduction of CO2 due to displacement of fossil fuels, considering life-cycle
GHG emissions associated with viable collection, hauling, and energy conversion and distribution
systems. The GHG reductions and costs associated with this policy are accounted for in the
transportation sector in the TLU-10 analysis.
AFW-5a.

Soil Carbon Management—NT/CT

This policy aims to reduce oxidation of soil carbon compounds through reduced soil disturbance.
Carbon sequestered in soil can be increased through the adoption of farming practices, such as
conservation tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) cultivation that provide enhanced ground cover and
minimal aeration of soil carbon. Common definitions of CT are systems that leave 50% or more of
the soil covered with residue. Kentucky is one of the country’s leaders in NT agriculture, due to
widespread adoption of the technique in the last decade. GHG reductions in this policy are due to
increased carbon accumulation, reduction in fossil fuel consumption, and reduction in commercial
fertilizer use.
The implementation of NT/CT farming programs would be aided by the provision of funding,
including carbon credits, federal grants, and state-level programs that provide assistance to farmers
undertaking alternative farming methods that will increase the soil carbon sequestration.

3-10

AFW-5b.

Soil Carbon Management—Winter Cover Crops

This policy increases carbon sequestration in the soil and can improve nitrogen levels as well.
Kentucky is one of the few states where winter cover crops are viable and can improve farm
revenue. Both GHG reductions and cost savings are possible from reduced nitrogen application.
GHG reductions can also be attributed to reduced N2O emissions from nitrogen runoff or leaching.
Other benefits include reduced wind and water erosion and improved wildlife habitat.
AFW-6.

Increase Productivity of Abandoned, Underutilized, and Reclaimed Lands

This policy promotes the productive use of lands that are otherwise not currently producing—
namely, abandoned, underutilized, reclaimed mined lands, and marginal agricultural lands. These
lands are available for planting of forage crops, native grasses, or energy crops, as appropriate.
Implementation of this policy will need to include site preparation, as many of these lands are
currently not able to support any crop production. Benefits include increased carbon sequestration,
production of biomass that can be used as an energy feedstock, decreased soil erosion, improved
wildlife habitat, and improved land value and aesthetics. GHG reductions are realized through
increased carbon sequestration and displacement of fossil fuels by biomass energy feedstocks.
Kentucky’s rich mining history provides an abundant supply of previously mined lands ripe for
production. This policy also promotes the improvement of crop yield on previously mined lands
through application of soil amendments.
The quantification of this policy assumed that biomass produced on these lands would be used to
displace in-state fossil fuel use. As this policy has complete overlap with AFW-2, Expanded Use
of Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, and Steam Production, the reductions and costs of
AFW-6 were not included in the total in Table 3-2. Nevertheless, this policy represents a great
opportunity for GHG reductions and other side benefits.
AFW-7a.

Reforestation, Afforestation, and Restoration of Mined Lands and Other Non-forested
Lands—Mined Lands

This policy seeks to increase carbon stored in vegetation and soils through expanding the land base
associated with terrestrial carbon sequestration. Establishing new forests (“afforestation”) on land
not currently experiencing other uses, such as abandoned mine lands, increases the amount of
carbon in biomass and soils compared to preexisting conditions. In addition to planting forest
cover, this policy considers site and soil preparation, erosion control, and stand stocking to ensure
conditions that support forest growth.
AFW-7b.

Reforestation, Afforestation, and Restoration of Mined Lands and Other Non-forested
Lands—Other Lands

This policy seeks to increase carbon stored in vegetation and soils through afforestation on other
non-forested lands (in addition to the previously mined lands considered in AFW-7a). These lands
include underutilized land not currently in agricultural production, forest, or development. This
policy also recommends re-establishing stands on forest land that is currently understocked.
Improvement of forest stocking and expansion of forest acres bring associated co-benefits of

3-11

watershed protection, improved wildlife habitat, biodiversity conservation, and enhanced
aesthetics and recreation. Key challenges to the success of this policy include identifying sufficient
funding and incentives for planting.
AFW-8.

Advanced MSW Reuse, Recycling, and Organic Waste Management Programs

This policy focuses on diverting MSW away from landfills through reuse, recycling, and organic
waste management programs in order to reduce generation of uncontrolled methane emissions
during waste management and the upstream energy and emissions associated with production and
transport of waste materials and packaging. The goal of this policy is to divert 50% of all MSW by
2025. Diversion can include recycling, reusing, composting, repurposing, and converting waste to
usable products.
The policy has an additional goal to improve the recycling rate of common household recyclable
materials from 35% (2008) to 40% by 2025. Emissions are lowered by reducing the total amount
of waste deposited at landfills and by reducing amounts of upstream energy needed to produce
unnecessary products/packaging. Key challenges include identifying funding for waste programs
and implementing programs in rural areas where population density is low. Additionally, methods
to encourage curbside participation are difficult to quantify.
AFW-9.

Landfill Methane Energy Programs

This policy aims to reduce MSW landfill emissions through installation of landfill gas collection
and usage equipment. This covers both landfills that are legally required to control their emissions
and those that do not meet minimum volume requirements. The renewable energy (methane)
created at landfills during anaerobic degradation of wastes unable to be utilized in recycling and
compost programs can be used to displace fossil fuel through the installation of methane control
and collection systems. Note that Kentucky already has one bioreactor facility whose methane is
piped to an industrial park and used as an energy source. The goal of this policy is by 2025 to
avoid 50% of the methane emissions that would be generated under business-as-usual conditions.
Key challenges to the success of this policy are identifying sufficient funds to meet the capital cost
requirements of installing and running collection equipment.

Energy Supply
Overview of Energy Supply Emissions
As a coal-producing state, Kentucky relies more heavily on coal as the fuel to generate electricity
than any other state in the nation, except for West Virginia. According to records maintained by
the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2009 Kentucky power producers burned
coal to generate more than 84,000,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, or about 93% of
total generation. As a result, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity consumption have
consistently accounted for approximately half of Kentucky’s total emissions, which are higher
than the national average share of emissions (34%), 1 as shown in Figure 4-1. The use of coal has
led to low electricity rates in Kentucky compared to the rest of the country, which has allowed
electricity-intensive industries to flourish in the state, as acknowledged in Kentucky’s Energy
Plan. 2 Those energy-intensive industries provide valuable goods and services to many states
beyond the borders of Kentucky.

In 2005, emissions associated with Kentucky’s electricity consumption (91 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent [MMtCO2e]) were about 7.5 MMtCO2e lower than those associated
with electricity production (98 MMtCO2e). The higher level for production-based emissions
reflects GHG emissions associated with net exports of electricity to other states and to

1

For the United States as a whole, there is relatively little difference between the emissions from
electricity use and emissions from electricity production, as the nation imports only about 1% of its
electricity, and exports even less.

neighboring regions (see Figure 4-2). 3 Reference Case projections of electricity production for
2008 through 2030 indicate that Kentucky will remain a net exporter of electricity. Emissions
from net electricity exports are projected to increase over the 2008–2030 period, from 4.1
MMtCO2e in 2008 to 5.7 MMtCO2e in 2030. Overall, the Reference Case projection indicates
that production-based emissions (associated with electricity generated in-state) will increase by
about 42 MMtCO2e from 2005 to 2030 (i.e., from 98 to 140 MMtCO2e), and consumption-based
emissions (associated with electricity consumed in-state) will increase by about 43 MMtCO2e
from 2005 to 2030 (i.e., from 91 to 134 MMtCO2e).

Exports vary from year to year based upon multiple factors, including fuel cost, fuel supply
interruptions, and general market demand. Kentucky’s favorable electricity prices, driven
predominantly by coal-based generation, support the expectation that it will be a net exporter of
electricity for the foreseeable future, with approximately 4% of annual generation projected to be
exported over the 2008–2030 period.
Figure 4-3 shows recent and projected in-state generation by fuel source. The Reference Case
projection indicates that while recent increases in natural gas and petroleum generation are
expected to continue, coal is expected to remain the fuel of choice, accounting for 93% of
electricity generation through 2030.

Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the in-state and
out-of-state) electricity sources used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimate reflects
the assumptions described in Appendix A.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Looking forward, Kentucky’s reliance on coal as the primary fuel for the generation of electricity
presents both challenges and opportunities for emission reductions. Opportunities arise to reduce
emissions in both the demand for and the supply of electricity to Kentuckians. Historically low
prices have limited the economic need for demand-side efficiency measures, leaving significant
opportunities for additional efficiencies on the customer side of the meter. These are largely
identified in Chapter 5, covering recommendations in the residential, commercial, and industrial
sectors; however, two polices that partially address demand-side opportunities are included here
and discussed below under Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts.
Substantial emission reductions are also possible through changes in the generation,
transmission, and distribution of electricity in Kentucky. Generation-based reductions are
possible through improvements in the combustion efficiency of existing coal plants; through the
replacement of inefficient coal plants with ones utilizing the newest combustion technologies;
through the use of replacement fuels, such as biomass or natural gas; and through the use of
carbon capture and storage or reuse (CCSR) technologies. Transmission and distribution (T&D)
efficiencies can be found through the use of more efficient equipment, such as new conductors
and transformers, and through the installation of smart grid technology. These types of changes
would entail up-front costs, but will result in cost savings over time.
Measures aimed at improving the emissions associated with the generation of electricity
dominate the recommendations and offer the majority of potential reductions. However, for some
of these measures to be adopted, certain challenges must be overcome. For example, the average
coal-fired power plant in Kentucky is more than 35 years old. There have been significant
advances in power generation technology during the lives of Kentucky’s power plants. However,
uncertainties in the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) Program pose a significant
disincentive, not only to power plant efficiency improvements but also to biomass co-firing,
because in some cases such a project may be deemed a “major modification” that results in
additional emissions, triggering additional pollution control requirements that can cost hundreds
of millions of dollars. Refinements in the regulatory program are needed to fully achieve the
potential benefits of biomass co-firing and efficiency improvements at existing power plants. 5
Another opportunity lies in the future use of nuclear generation. Nuclear energy is controversial
everywhere, and in some respects even more so in Kentucky. Nevertheless, nuclear energy
provides reliable baseload power with dramatically lower GHG emissions than the existing
generation mix. Before nuclear energy can become part of Kentucky’s energy future, public
support sufficient to effect the repeal of the statutory ban will need to be demonstrated.
Renewable energy generation is another opportunity. The availability of adequate wind and solar
resources, as well as the current cost-effectiveness of these generation technologies in Kentucky,
5

The analysis performed for this report considered 13 retrofit technologies not including biomass cofiring, and estimated that Kentucky coal units have only implemented half of the potential retrofits,
limiting their application to those that do not trigger NSR. Implementing efficiency improvements at
existing power plants has the potential to decrease CO2 and other emissions on a pound per million
British thermal unit basis, while at the same time reducing fuel costs.

4-5

is uncertain. The cost-effectiveness will likely improve over time with technological and
fabrication advances and if the presumed increased costs for fossil fuel-generated electricity due
to recent U.S. Environmental Protection Agency actions are realized. Studying and testing how
and where these technologies might be best applied will help ensure that renewable energy
opportunities are not missed. Incentives and mandates could also help foster development of
these technologies, but will require legislation.
Biofuels represent both immediate and long-term opportunities for Kentucky. Kentucky’s forests
and agricultural lands offer a substantial and largely untapped resource for a variety of
applications. 6 Biomass can be co-fired with coal in some existing boilers, can be the primary fuel
source for new dedicated biomass generators, and can be converted into liquid fuels for use in
transportation, electricity generation, and heat. However, the lack of a biomass supply chain is a
major impediment to the use of biomass in Kentucky. Biomass development will require creation
of the infrastructure necessary to support the procurement, transport, and utilization of biomass.
Utilities interested in developing or purchasing biomass generation must have the confidence that
the fuel will be available at competitive prices for the expected life of the plant, and that biomass
investments will qualify for cost recovery.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Energy Supply (ES) Technical Work Group (TWG) developed recommendations for 12
policies (see Table 4-2), 10 of which were then reviewed, revised, and ultimately approved by
the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) members present and voting. The KCAPC
rejected one policy (ES-12) and transferred ES-2 to the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial
(RCI) TWG. The KCAPC is recommending for the Secretary’s consideration multiple policies
and sub-policies for the ES sector that offer the potential for significant GHG emission
reductions. The policies analyzed are summarized in Table 4-2. The numbering used to denote
these policies is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect prioritization among the
recommended policies. An asterisk indicates that only that sub-policy is used for the sector total.
It is acknowledged that the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) participated in
discussing the policy recommendations in this chapter. However, the KPSC abstained from
taking a position for or against any policy recommendation that could come before it in an
adjudicated proceeding. It is also acknowledged that the KPSC may need additional statutory
authority to consider some of the policy recommendations.

The KCAPC approved 10 policy options, totaling nearly 756 MMtCO2e in cumulative GHG
emission reductions between 2011 and 2030. These reductions are the largest of all four sector
groups, and nearly double the reductions of the next-largest group (RCI). In spite of this, not all
recommended ES policies were quantitatively analyzed. Some lacked data upon which to
reasonably base analysis, while others were enabling policies that allow subsequent policies to
operate but do not offer measurable reductions on their own.
The expected cost to the Kentucky economy per ton of emissions reduced from this set of ES
recommendations is $24. Individual policy cost-effectiveness ranged from a low of $8.80 per
tCO2e (ES-1, Biomass Development and Efficiency Improvements at Existing Power Plants,
Supply-Side Efficiency) to a high of $179 per tCO2e (ES-10, Gas-to Liquids-Technology). None
of the ES recommendations offered negative cost (cost savings) performance.
Descriptions of specific recommendations are given below. The KCAPC recommendations
covered the following:
•

Biomass used as a supplemental fuel at coal power plants, and as a primary fuel at dedicated
plants.

•

Efficiency improvements at existing coal-generating plants.

•

Use of new technologies at fossil fueled generators, including integrated gasification
combined cycle, CCSR, advanced pulverized coal, and circulating fluidized bed; faster
development of CCSR and enhanced oil recovery technologies; and advanced natural gas
combined cycle.

•

Pricing strategies to promote the use of renewables and greater customer-side efficiency.

•

Development of nuclear generation in Kentucky.

•

Projects to explore the potential for wind and solar generation.

•

Development of smart grid and efficiency improvement in T&D systems.

•

Development of additional shale gas, including demand-pull recommendations for increased
use of natural gas and its derivatives as transportation fuels.

Additional details regarding the application of these recommendations to Kentucky and their
analysis (targets, implementation mechanisms, parties involved, modeling approach, etc.) are
provided in Appendix F.

Energy Supply Sector Policy Descriptions
The ES sector has multiple opportunities for mitigating GHG emissions from electricity
generation, transmission, and distribution, whether generated through the combustion of fossil
fuels, nuclear, biomass, or other renewable energy sources through centralized power stations
feeding the grid or distributed generation facilities. See Appendix F for detail on each
recommendation.
ES-1.

Biomass Development and Efficiency Improvements
at Existing Power Plants

This policy recommendation is intended to promote the use of biomass at both new and
repowered existing stand-alone plants, as well as co-firing biomass at fossil-fuel electric
generating units. The biomass goal of this recommendation is to generate 4,182,000 MWh of
electricity from biomass by 2025. This policy will also include energy efficiency improvements
at existing fossil-fuel electric generating units. Current technologies could achieve efficiency
improvements in the range of 3%–5% for the current generating fleet. Implementing efficiency
improvements at existing power plants has the potential to decrease CO2 and other emissions on
a pound per million British thermal unit basis, while at the same time reducing fuel costs.
ES-3.

Advanced Fossil Fuel Technology (IGCC, CCSR, Advanced
Pulverized Coal, CFB) Incentives, Support, or Requirements

Advanced fossil technologies for electric generation include more efficient—and thus loweremitting—generation technologies. Advanced fossil technologies combined with CCSR may
have the potential to significantly lower CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel-based
electricity generation. The goal of this policy is to facilitate the development of at least one
advanced fossil fuel electric generating project utilizing coal and one utilizing natural gas by
2020.
ES-4.

CCSR Enabling Policies, R&D, Infrastructure, and Incentives, Including Enhanced Oil
Recovery Using CO2

For fossil fuels to operate in a GHG-constrained world, the capture of CO2 from natural gas- and
coal-fueled power plants, and the successful storage or utilization (in a manner permanently
preventing its entry into the atmosphere or oceans) of that carbon are necessary. Kentucky needs
to further characterize the capacity of its geology to successfully store carbon after capture. The
legal and regulatory issues involved around carbon capture and storage (CCS) also have to be
addressed. This recommendation states that by 2012, Kentucky should work with the Carbon
Management Research Group to address the intrastate and interstate legal and regulatory issues,
including pore space ownership and long-term environmental stewardship and risk management,
and by 2018, site a commercial-size demonstration project for CCS or utilization in the
Commonwealth.

ES-5.

Pricing Strategies to Promote Efficiency and Renewables, Including Net Metering,
Feed-In Tariff, Interconnection Rules, Inclined Rates, and Examination of the Standard
Rate Structure

Pricing strategies can be used to encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and demand
response. Some pricing mechanisms encourage utilities to facilitate their customers’ reduction in
consumption, while others encourage customers to reduce consumption directly. Three pricing
strategies were analyzed. With time-of-use pricing customers are charged a different rate for
electricity during different time blocks during the day corresponding to the utility’s cost to
produce electricity during that time. Customers would have the flexibility to modify
consumption patterns, reducing both their cost and their contribution to system peaks. This
pricing structure can be advantageous for all types of customers in aligning price with cost,
sending the appropriate signal to the customer, and modifying consumption patterns to maximize
system efficiency and conservation.
Interconnection rules and net metering policies can facilitate the cost-effective interconnection of
renewable or distributed energy resources onto the power grid. The goal of this policy is to
establish effective net metering and interconnection rules to facilitate the connection of
renewable or distributed energy resources to the grid.
A feed-in tariff (FIT) establishes rates for renewable power and mandates electric utilities to
purchase that renewable power under long-term contracts. A Kentucky FIT 7 should apply to the
following renewable energy technologies: solar, wind, low-impact biomass/biogas, and
hydroelectric. Utilities would be mandated to purchase power from any renewable energy
generator within the state who meets the technical requirements. Residential and small
commercial systems would all be eligible to participate.
ES-6.

New Nuclear Energy Capacity

Nuclear power has historically been a low-GHG source of electricity. However, no new
commercial reactor has come on line in the United Sates since 1996, due to high capital costs,
the absence of a repository or technology for permanent disposal of nuclear waste, and pubic
concerns for safety. Steps to encourage nuclear power options in the state would have to begin
with the removal of the statutory ban against constructing a nuclear plant in Kentucky (KRS 278605 and 610). Steps could also include providing a streamlined siting review and streamlined
appeals process and enacting policies to reduce the risk to capital. The recommendation goal is to
install 2,000 MW of nuclear generation in Kentucky by 2025.
ES-7.

Renewable Energy Incentives and Barrier Removal, Including Combined Heat and
Power (CHP)

Renewable portfolio standards require utilities to meet a portion of their electricity demand with
electricity generated with renewable resources. The recommended standard would incorporate
efficiency and renewable electricity resources and require load-serving entities to obtain
gradually increasing percentages of renewable energy resources or energy efficiency demand
7

It is not required that both FIT and a renewable portfolio standard function together. They can be independent.
4-11

reductions ranging from 3% of sales in 2013 to 15% beginning in 2021. The recommendation
also states that new hydro capacity and improvements to existing hydro plants that result in
added capacity should qualify as a renewable energy resource under a state portfolio standard;
that third-party partnership distributed renewable energy systems allow the host entity to
purchase power from the on-site system; and that a well-funded, long-term statewide education
program be developed to educate the general population and decision makers about energy
fundamentals and renewable energy. The recommendation was analyzed assuming four alternate
renewable/efficiency resource mixes emphasizing (1) mixed renewables, (2) biomass, (3)
imported out-of-state wind generation, and (4) solar photovoltaics (PV).
ES-8.

Technology Research and Development

This policy develops a roadmap for expanding traditional research for fossil fuels into renewable
energy sources, energy efficiency technologies, distributed/grid-scale storage, carbon-free fuel
generation, and pyrolysis of municipal solid waste, and will provide for large-scale
demonstrations, as well as smaller deployments in residential or commercial applications. The
recommendation also seeks to establish a pilot project to demonstrate the construction, operation,
and grid integration of utility-scale PV power plants, specifically calling for the installation of
five utility-scale PV power plants of at least 1 MW each, with one of the plants being at least 5
MW. Each of the major utilities in Kentucky should be targeted as partners in installing these
plants. Subsidies need to be supplied to bring the cost of these pilot plants down to the point
where they are cost competitive for the participating utilities.
ES-9.

Policies to Support Wind Energy

Even though Kentucky has low wind resources relative to midwestern states, Kentucky could see
wind farm development in the future. The Commonwealth has good transmission system lines
(69 kilovolts and up) across the state that might serve a distributed network of wind farms. If
Kentucky is to develop wind capacity, it needs to better understand the resource. While the wind
maps and calculations by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are helpful in
understanding U.S. wind resources, they lead to additional questions and the need for more data.
The state should collect wind data to further validate or identify bias within the wind maps. The
data should be published and may be used when crafting policies. The recommendation calls for
the creation of a working group tasked to identify 10 potential wind sites around Kentucky for
placement of meteorological towers, and in 2013–2014 to install equipment and collect and
process data. Towers would collect wind speed data at an elevation appropriate to extrapolate
information about wind speeds at 100 and 120 meters.
ES-10.

Shale Gas Development and Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure and Natural Gas
Liquids Technology

The Shale Gas policy is intended to help stimulate increased shale gas production and
development in Kentucky. Increased Kentucky production will provide more natural gas supply
as an alternative fuel to help reduce overall GHG emissions. The goal for the Shale Gas policy is
to provide for increased development of natural gas from shale formations, with an increase from
the current annual production level of approximately 100 billion cubic feet per year (bcf/yr) to an

4-12

annual level of 150 bcf/yr by 2020, through increased drilling as well as enhanced drilling
methods. Shale gas development should be encouraged by state action to ease the regulatory,
permitting, and lag time for new well development and completion.
The goal for the Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure policy is to provide for the
development of a statewide network of compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations, in order to
(1) have natural gas filling stations in all cities with populations greater than 10,000 by 2020, and
(2) facilitate the increased use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, to support the deployment of
11,700 CNG vehicles by 2020.
The goal for the Natural Gas Liquids policy is to provide for the development of liquid fuel from
natural gas, so that the fuel could be used in 2,000 heavy vehicles by 2016, instead of oil-based
fuels such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Also, a secondary goal is to provide liquids removal
capacity to accommodate the 50% additional shale production goal by 2020.
ES-11.

Smart Grid, Including Transmission and Distribution Efficiency

Smart grid can be divided into two functional areas: customer load and use management, and
T&D monitoring and control. Application of each can result in increased electrical efficiency,
utilization, operational efficiency, reliability, or electricity load management. This
recommendation calls for actions to achieve 25% coverage for advanced metering infrastructure
(AMI) by 2015, 50% by 2020, and 100% by 2025.
This recommendation also proposes to replace transmission infrastructure (transformers and
conductors) with higher-efficiency equipment as projects are implemented to achieve a10%
reduction in transmission losses by 2030. Similarly, it is recommended that Kentucky replace
distribution infrastructure (transformers and conductors) with higher-efficiency equipment as
projects are implemented to reduce distribution losses by 10% by 2030. Transmission and
distribution losses are typically around 5%, so a 10% reduction in the losses would be 0.5%
reduction of the net generation.
Finally, the use of a prepaid meter program should be studied to determine whether and the
extent to which conservation and efficiency gains associated with prepaid meter programs are
greater than those of AMI with in-home display.

Chapter 5
Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Sectors
Overview of Sectoral Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors were directly responsible for slightly
more than 20% of Kentucky’s gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as of 2005—a total of just
over 37 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e). Direct emissions from
these sectors result principally from the on-site combustion of natural gas, oil, and coal, as well
as the release of CO2 and fluorinated gases (hydrofluorocarbons [HFCs] and perfluorocarbons)
during industrial processes; from the leakage of HFCs from refrigeration and related equipment;
and to a smaller degree, from the use of sulfur hexafluoride in the utility industry. Direct
emissions in the RCI sectors produce GHG emissions when fuels are combusted to provide space
heating, process heating, and other applications.
In addition to direct emissions from combustion of fuels and industrial processes in the RCI
sectors, nearly all of the electricity sold in Kentucky is consumed as the result of RCI activity.
Emissions associated with producing the electricity consumed in Kentucky were nearly 50%
(90.9 MMtCO2e) of the state’s gross GHG emissions in 2005. 1 Combining fuel use, industrial
process emissions, and electricity accounts for 70% of the state’s total gross GHG emissions.
Kentucky’s future GHG emissions, therefore, will depend significantly on future trends in the
consumption of electricity and other fuels in the RCI sectors.
Historical and projected GHG emissions for the RCI sectors by fuel and source are provided in
Figure 5-1 for the Reference Case forecast scenario. This figure illustrates that RCI emissions
associated with electricity use are expected to comprise about 77% of RCI emissions by 2030.
Industrial gases and petroleum each contributes about 7% of 2030 emissions, with the balance
attributable to natural gas (6%) and coal (3%). The projections do not account for utility actions
to comply with new or pending U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations.
RCI emissions are forecasted to increase by approximately 1.2% annually between 2005 and
2030, but this overall estimate masks large changes within emission sources based on the
assumptions and data from 2010 and 2011. Electricity and industrial process emissions are
projected to account for all of the sector’s growth in gross GHG emissions during this period.
GHG emissions from the electricity sector grow at about 1.6% annually, which is faster than
electricity demand growth (1.4% per year), because the assumed Reference Case electricity
generation resources are GHG intensive. Emissions associated with industrial process emissions
are expected to rise annually by about 2.6% between 2005 and 2030. Emissions from fuels (coal,
petroleum, wood, and natural gas) are expected to decrease by about 10% over the 2005–2030
period.

Gross emissions here denote GHG emissions from activities in Kentucky, adjusted for exports of electricity, oil,
and gas, but not including consideration of estimated “sinks” of GHGs in the forestry and land-use sectors.

Figure 5-2 shows that GHG emissions from the residential sector are dominated by electricityrelated GHG emissions. Residential electricity emissions are forecasted to grow at 1.5% over the

GHGs for the residential sector in the Reference Case.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The principal means to reduce RCI emissions in Kentucky include improving energy efficiency,
substituting electricity and natural gas with lower-emission energy resources (such as biomass
and wind), and various strategies to decrease the emissions associated with electricity production
(see Chapter 4, Energy Supply Sector). The state’s limited pursuit of energy efficiency until
recent years offers opportunities to reduce emissions through programs and initiatives to improve
the efficiency of buildings, appliances, and industrial practices. The advantages of having “lowhanging fruit” in the form of low-cost energy efficiency opportunities in the RCI sectors are
countered by an underdeveloped private sector that will likely be responsible for scoping,
implementing, and evaluating energy efficiency projects. These jobs require special training and
equipment that will take time for firms within the state to acquire.
Kentucky’s large industrial sector presents opportunities for cost-effective demand reductions.
Industrial energy efficiency is typically relatively cheap compared to new sources of energy
supply, and energy efficiency can increase the competitiveness of firms in the state. Similarly,
industrial process GHGs can typically be mitigated cost-effectively. However, with the exception
of the industrial combined heat and power policy described below, Kentucky has few existing
policies or planned actions specifically designed to reduce GHGs from the industrial sector.
Kentucky’s utilities have been pursuing limited residential demand-side management (DSM)
programs. House Bill (HB) 240 (2010) allows the Kentucky Public Service Commission to
create requirements for DSM programs and allows utilities cost recovery for DSM activities. We
assume that existing residential electric DSM programs are equal to 0.25% of load over the
2010–2030 period and are not in the Reference Case GHG forecast. HB 2 (2009) requires state
and local government-owned (and leased) public buildings to meet high-performance building
targets. Table 5-1 presents the estimated effects of residential DSM and public-sector highperformance buildings.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) has identified significant opportunities for
reducing GHG emissions growth attributable to the RCI sectors in Kentucky. These include
expanding or launching energy efficiency programs for electricity, promoting high-performance
buildings in the private sector, regularly updating building codes, requiring state and local
governments to implement beyond-code building practices and green power purchase/generation,
labeling and benchmarking buildings, as well as actively promoting adoption of combined heat
and power in the state. The KCAPC has also identified significant opportunities to reduce GHG
emissions through policies addressing electricity production (detailed in Chapter 4).
The RCI Technical Work Group (TWG) developed recommendations for nine policies (see
Table 5-2. 2 ) that were then reviewed, revised, and ultimately approved by the KCAPC members
present and voting. One additional policy option (RCI-10) was assigned to the Energy Supply
(ES) TWG for analysis. The KCAPC recommends for the Secretary’s consideration a set of nine
policy options for the RCI sectors, as detailed in Table 5-2. 3 The GHG emission reductions and
costs per ton of GHG reductions for seven of these policies were quantified. The quantified
policy recommendations could lead to emission savings from Reference Case projections of:
•

38 MMtCO2e per year by 2030, and a cumulative savings of over 400 MMtCO2e from 2011
to 2030.

•

Net cost of approximately $1.2 billion through 2030 on a net present value basis. The
weighted-average cost of these policies is about $3/tCO2e.

It is acknowledged that the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC) participated in
discussing the policy recommendations in this chapter. However, the KPSC abstained from
taking a position for or against any policy recommendation that could come before it in an
adjudicated proceeding. It is also acknowledged that the KPSC may need additional statutory
authority to consider some of the policy recommendations.

Negative cost effectiveness values reflect economic savings. It is important to note that some of the policy options
with an estimated cost savings still are likely to require significant up-front capital investments.

Overlaps within RCI
To assess the cumulative emission reductions for the policies in the RCI sectors, it is necessary
to consider any overlaps among the policies that affect similar types of energy use. Specifically,
some policies (such as RCI-2) are defined by their goals for reducing energy use, while others
(such as RCI-3, RCI-5, and RCI-6) are defined by addressing a specific type of energy use or
supply. Policies were compared in terms of the type of energy use they target and the energy
reduction measures each is expected to implement. Overlaps were identified and quantified by
sector (RCI or government), type of energy use targeted (water heating, space heating, etc.), and
measure (e.g., high-efficiency air conditioning).
•

RCI-3 (Expand Electric Utility DSM Programs) overlaps are estimated at the measure level.
RCI-3 and RCI-2 are both policies that offer incentives to end users to purchase more
efficient equipment. RCI-3 provides incentives for electricity measures, such as ENERGY
STAR appliances, weatherization, and building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning
measures. We estimate that these measures and targeted markets (end users) are similar to
those expected to be provided incentives under RCI-2. Because of the similarity in measures
and targets, the GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from electric efficiency
under this policy are reduced by 75% to account for overlaps with RCI-2. This estimate is
conservative, to ensure that GHG reductions under RCI-3 are not double counted with RCI-2.

•

RCI-5 (Financing for Combined Heat and Power [CHP]) is a supply-side policy
recommendation that is quantified according to the expected demand for thermal resources in
the commercial and industrial sectors. More efficient use of hot water from improved
commercial building heating and cooling or domestic use of hot water under RCI-2 could
reduce the supply of commercial CHP. Commercial GHG reductions and associated costs or
benefits from electric efficiency under this policy are reduced by 20% to account for
potential overlaps with RCI-2. The KCAPC did not develop an RCI policy specifically to
improve industrial energy efficiency that could reduce the supply of industrial CHP.
Therefore, industrial GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from the CHP policy
are not reduced to account for overlaps with other policies.

•

RCI-9 (Building Commissioning, Benchmarking, and Labeling) is composed of two main
elements: commissioning and building audits that are the basis for benchmarking and
labeling. Commissioning new buildings is assumed to be a part of the “above code” or green
building portion of RCI-2. Similarly, recommissioning existing buildings is a cost-effective
program to reduce energy consumption that is assumed to fall under the retrofit element of
RCI-2. Therefore, the GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from the
commissioning and recommissioning elements of the policy are reduced by 100% to account
for overlaps with RCI-2. The net effect of the overlap reductions is to reduce GHG mitigation
from the policy by 85% by 2030, as most of the reductions from the policy are estimated to
result from commissioning and recommissioning. While building audits are part of most
residential energy efficiency programs, their penetration without the home sales element of
this policy would be limited. A similar argument can be made for the limited penetration of

5-7

Overlaps Between Other Sectors
There are several potential overlaps between RCI and other sectors. These potential overlaps are
discussed qualitatively here. The first is that electricity energy efficiency investments from the
suite of RCI policy recommendations reduce electricity demand. Reducing future electricity sales
makes it easier for regulated entities to meet a target for renewable electricity sales as a
percentage of total sales. Such a renewable electricity target is being developed under ES-7, and
the demand reductions from RCI would likely make compliance with the target more costeffective and easier to attain.
An additional feedback is that certain Energy Supply policies will have the effect of reducing the
GHG emissions associated with electricity generation. In this case, RCI policies that target
electricity use will have a correspondingly reduced ability to deliver GHG emission reductions.
The RCI analysis assumes that current and future electricity generation is largely coal-fired. If
considerable fuel switching occurs from coal to cleaner sources of electricity, then the electricityrelated GHG reductions from the RCI policies would be reduced. This impact has not been
reflected in the analysis.
Figure 5-5 shows the breakdown for the KCAPC policy recommendations from the RCI sectors
by their contribution to GHG reductions.

RCI-7; 4%

RCI-1; 3%
RCI-2; 12%

The policy recommendations described briefly below, and in more detail in Appendix G, not
only result in significant emission reductions and costs savings, but offer a host of additional
5-8

benefits as well. These benefits include savings to consumers and businesses on energy bills,
which can result in the reduction in spending on energy by low-income households; reduced
peak demand, electricity system capital and operating costs, risk of power shortages, energy
price increases, and price volatility; improved public health as a result of reduced pollutant and
particulate emissions by power plants; reduced dependence on imported fuel sources;
employment expansion; and enhanced economic development opportunities.
For the RCI policies recommended by the KCAPC to yield the levels of savings described here,
they must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner. This means, for
example, not only putting the policies themselves in place, but also attending to the development
of “supporting policies” that are needed to help make the recommended policies effective. While
the adoption of the recommended policies can result in considerable benefits to Kentucky’s
environment, security of energy supply and the state’s consumers, the state needs to ensure
careful, comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation, as well as consistent support,
of these policies in order for these benefits to be achieved.

5-9

Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI) Policy Descriptions

RCI-1.

Improve Building Codes for Energy Efficiency, Coupled with Improved Energy Code
Training and Enforcement

The KCAPC recommends upgrading and enforcing Kentucky’s building energy codes that
specify minimum energy efficiency requirements for new buildings or for existing buildings
undergoing a major renovation. Given the lifetime of buildings, amending state building codes to
include minimum energy efficiency requirements and periodically updating energy efficiency
codes could provide long-term GHG savings. Kentucky can improve energy codes to include
energy efficiency gains, lighting design, building envelope design, and integrated building design
strategies. The recommendation expands enforcement of building energy codes, requires
Kentucky to regularly adopt national codes with amendments as appropriate, and achieve
targeted improvements in energy efficiency through educational programs for building inspectors
and code enforcement officials to ensure that the existing codes are implemented and enforced.
RCI-2.

Promote, Encourage, and Provide Incentives for “Beyond-Code” Efficiency in All
Building Characteristics and Systems That Impact Energy Consumption

The KCAPC recommends providing incentives and targets to induce the owners and developers
of new buildings to improve the efficiency of the use of energy and other resources in those
buildings, along with provisions for raising target levels periodically and providing resources to
building industry professionals to help achieve the desired building performance. Improving the
energy efficiency design of buildings will have an immediate and ongoing impact on reducing
GHG emissions.
The policy provides tiered incentives for energy efficiency in new buildings that achieve a
reduction in energy use relative to U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Executive Order 430.2B
regarding energy standards for commercial buildings, as well as the 2009 International Energy
Conservation Code (IECC) for residential buildings. Building performance is to be certified by a
design professional or a nationally recognized third-party-verified green building certification
system for commercial or residential buildings (e.g., Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED), American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers
[ASHRAE]/U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)/Illuminating Engineering Society of North
America [IESNA] Standard 189, or Green Globes New Construction). Additionally, the policy
can reward projects where minimum energy efficiency exceeds American National Standards
Institute/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 benchmark levels. Incentives could include lowcost loans for investments in energy efficiency, tax credits, expedited plan review permits, and
feebates for design professionals.
RCI-3.

Expand Utility DSM Programs for Electricity

The KCAPC recommends DSM programs, including energy efficiency education, programs, or
goals for reduced electricity consumption, and calls for actions that influence the quantity and/or

5-10

patterns of use of energy consumed by end users. This policy recommendation focuses on
increasing investment in electricity DSM/energy efficiency through innovative actions developed
and implemented by utilities, community partners, and customers. The ultimate goal is to provide
tools, information, assistance, and knowledge that will help customers manage their energy
consumption more efficiently and reduce their consumption. The GHG emission reductions
assume that DSM and education programs begin in 2012 and reach full implementation by 2015,
when they achieve incremental annual load reductions of 1% of the forecasted load. Load
reductions occur for all RCI sectors at the same implementation rate through 2030.
RCI-4.

Develop and Implement Comprehensive Education, Outreach, and Marketing, Including
Consumer Awareness, School Curriculum, Truth-in-Advertising, Technical Information
and Support (e.g., How to Do GHG Inventories, Rationales for Action, etc.)

The KCAPC recommends the development of consumer education courses and outreach
programs for GHG emission reductions. The policy will provide information and education to
present and future consumers in all levels of education—elementary, secondary, college,
university, and community colleges—and will develop guidelines to ensure that factual and
accurate information regarding GHG emission implications is provided to consumers through a
truth-in-advertising campaign targeting advertising of energy-consuming products. Additionally,
the policy will develop consumer product programs that may include education, incentives,
retailer training, marketing, and promotion, and will utilize tools, such as Web-based calculators,
to assist residents, businesses, and communities with developing GHG inventories and to
evaluate and act upon their GHG inventory results. The policy requires that by 2012, the
education awareness programs are in place, outreach programs are begun, and school curriculum
areas are evaluated to make sure they include GHG awareness.
RCI-5.

Financing Programs and Incentives for Energy Efficiency and CHP (PBF, Revolving
Loans, etc.)

The KCAPC recommends financing programs designed to eliminate a major barrier to private
investment in energy efficiency, conservation, or combined heat and power (CHP) measures
installed on buildings: the large up-front investment. By removing this barrier, building owners
are more likely to pursue building-scale energy efficiency retrofits and/or CHP installations.
A number of programs and incentives that have been successful in other jurisdictions could be
designed and implemented in Kentucky as part of this policy recommendation. Green mortgages
roll the costs of energy efficiency or CHP measures into new or refinanced mortgages and allow
the amortization of the costs of the efficient equipment to better match future utility bill savings
from the equipment. Public benefit funds (PBFs) provide a source of financing for all types of
sales rebate programs to “buy down” the incremental costs of CHP and/or energy-efficient
equipment. State income tax credits and property tax credits can also provide a source of funding
to households and firms to purchase energy-efficient equipment and/or CHP. Energy loan
programs, financed by state-issued bonds, provide low-interest loans and can also reduce the
large up-front investments associated with energy-efficient equipment and/or CHP. Finally,
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing programs work through the creation of a
public loan fund at the municipal level that is directed solely to financing energy efficiency
and/or CHP installations. The repayment of the funds takes place annually along with the

5-11

building owner’s property tax bill, giving PACE payments the same treatment as taxes for lien
priority purposes.
This policy pairs with RCI-6, which provides for similar financing mechanisms to encourage
investments in renewable energy by building owners.
RCI-6.

Financing Programs, Incentives, Policies, and Research for Conversion to Renewable
Energy or Low-Carbon Energy Sources

The KCAPC recommends financing programs designed to address the significant opportunity in
Kentucky for increased investments in renewable energy by building owners. Numerous ways
exist to encourage adoption of renewable energy options, including rebates funded through PBFs
or other mechanisms, low-cost loans provided through revolving loan funds, providing greater
security to lenders through loan-loss reserve funds, etc. Funding may also be available through
U.S. DOE programs. Market penetration will depend on funding levels and decisions concerning
what kinds of improvements qualify for funding. For the purposes of quantification, renewable
energy projects in Kentucky are assumed to be financed by a wide range of mechanisms that
reduce market barriers to their deployment and result in the renewable energy policy goals being
achieved.
RCI-7.

Government Lead by Example (GLE) in Highly Efficient State and Local Government
Buildings

The KCAPC recommends a policy to provide energy efficiency targets for new construction of
state and local government buildings and renovation of existing state and local government
buildings whose energy consumption is much higher than code standards. The Kentucky state
government is a significant consumer of energy. The state owns about 66.9 million square feet of
building space and leases an additional 5.2 million square feet. Furthermore, local government
buildings, such as courthouses, city halls, K–12 schools, and other facilities, are estimated at an
additional 60 million square feet. The Kentucky General Assembly has made great strides in the
maintenance of public buildings. However, the potential for significant improvements and
upgrades remains, reflecting opportunities for more energy savings through more energyefficient equipment and practices.
This policy requires the Kentucky Finance and Administration Cabinet to improve the efficiency
of energy and other resources in public buildings that receive 50% or more of their construction
funding from the Commonwealth. The policy requires new buildings to achieve a reduction in
energy use relative to DOE Executive Order 430.2B energy standard for commercial buildings
and the 2009 IECC for residential buildings, and includes certification by a design professional
or a nationally recognized third-party-verified green building certification system for commercial
or residential buildings (e.g., LEED, ASHRAE/USGBC/IESNA Standard 189, or Green Globes
New Construction).
RCI-8.

Training and Education for Builders, Contractors, and Building Operators

The KCAPC recommends a policy to provide training, education, and outreach for builders,
contractors, building operators, and code officials that encourages these building professionals to
5-12

incorporate energy efficiency and GHG emission reduction considerations in the conduct of their
work. Education and training should be mandatory and available to builders, contractors, and
others involved in the construction of new buildings and the retrofitting and renovation of
existing buildings. The recommendation develops technical/professional education courses and
outreach programs for GHG emission reductions to increase the number of professionals trained
in energy efficiency. It also requires targeted improvements in energy efficiency through
educational programs for builders, building inspectors, and other building industry professionals
to help ensure that the existing codes are implemented and enforced.
RCI-9.

Building Commissioning and Recommissioning, Including Energy Tracking and
Benchmarking, and Implement a Building Energy Labeling Program

The KCAPC recommends a policy to require building commissioning, labeling, and
benchmarking. Ongoing commissioning is the continued implementation of preventive
maintenance and performance reviews in order to keep building systems operating efficiently,
involving energy tracking and benchmarking, system tune-ups, equipment and sensor
calibrations, and staff retraining, among other program elements. This policy recommendation
would initiate commissioning efforts for publicly owned buildings. The efforts would extend the
scope of facilities to not only include capital construction, but also systematically address
existing buildings and facility management processes. The recommendation would look at
possible incentives for private facility owners who implement commissioning efforts for new
construction and renovations, existing buildings, and/or facility management processes.
Tracking and benchmarking the energy used in a building provides valuable information, not
only for comparative purposes between buildings of similar use classification, but also for
identification of buildings that have high and/or low performance, in order to determine efficient
utilization of energy and where resources need to be spent to reduce the energy costs.
Benchmarking is commonly used to identify the minimally acceptable performance of buildings.
Building energy labels provide information on the potential and actual energy usage of buildings,
give feedback to building owners and operators on how their buildings are performing, provide
insight into the value and potential long-term costs of a building and market-based forces to
influence energy efficiency investment opportunities, and can serve as a tool to provide for
differentiation in the marketplace.

Chapter 6
Transportation and Land Use Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Emissions from the transportation and land use (TLU) sectors include the emissions produced by
the operation of light- and heavy-duty (on-road) vehicles, as well as emissions produced by offroad or specialized vehicles, aircraft, rail engines, and marine engines. Emissions accounted for
in the TLU sectors include not only the direct emissions from vehicle exhaust, but also the
“upstream” emissions associated with the extraction and transportation of raw materials (usually
petroleum), as well as the emissions associated with the energy-intensive processes of refining,
distributing, and pumping fuel.
The TLU sectors represented approximately 20% of Kentucky’s greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in the 2005 inventory. While smaller than the 27% share the sector represents on a
nationwide scale, emissions from this sector are growing rapidly. Emissions grew from
approximately 27 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 1990 to 37
MMtCO2e in 2005—a growth of over 35% in 15 years. The TLU sectors are projected to be the
second-largest source of emissions growth after the energy supply sector over the 2005–2030
period. The sectors’ emissions are projected to reach 57 MMtCO2e by 2030—more than
doubling the 1990 estimate, with the largest share of that growth coming from on-road
commercial vehicles burning diesel fuel. Figure 6-1 shows historic and projected transportation
GHG emissions by fuel and source.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Kentucky has substantial opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from transportation sources.
The principal approaches to reducing GHG emissions from transportation and land use are:
•

Improving vehicle fuel efficiency;

•

Utilizing less carbon-intensive fuels, which produce lower volumes of GHG emissions per
unit of energy provided; and

•

Reducing travel volume or shifting travel to more energy-efficient modes, such as shared
travel or transit.

Prior to the establishment of stricter federal corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards
in 2007, in Kentucky and in the nation as a whole, vehicle fuel efficiency had improved little
since the late 1980s. Many studies have documented the potential for substantial increases in
efficiency, while maintaining vehicle size and performance. Automobile manufacturers typically
oppose dramatic increases in fuel economy. Key points of contention include the costs to
manufacturers and consumers. Even with the adoption of the new federal CAFE requirements,
there are opportunities for further increases in fuel efficiency, while maintaining vehicle size and
performance.
The use of fuels with lower per-mile GHG emissions could achieve larger market penetration in
Kentucky. Conventional gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles can use low-level blends of
biofuels, such as a blend of up to 15% ethanol in gasoline and up to 10% or even 20% biodiesel
in diesel, depending on manufacturer’s certifications. Alternative-technology vehicles can also
use more concentrated biofuels blends, as well as other types of alternative fuels, such as
electricity, natural gas, and hydrogen. The type of fuel used is a crucial determinant of a
vehicle’s GHG emissions from operation; while some alternative fuels are much cleaner options
than gasoline or diesel, other alternative fuels offer relatively little GHG benefit.
Alternative fuels from biomass, cellulosic residues, and energy crops have been identified by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Energy as the best near-term
opportunity to reduce foreign-oil dependence and GHG emissions from transportation. Key
determinants of the possible impact to GHG emissions will be the development and deployment
of new fuel types. At present, fuel distribution infrastructure is a constraining factor. Existing
federal legislation provides incentives in the form of income and sales tax credits for investments
in the production, storage, and distribution of biodiesel and ethanol.
Reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT), particularly of single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs), is
crucial to mitigating GHG emissions from transportation. Developing smarter land-use and
transportation development patterns that reduce trip length and support transit, carpooling, ride
sharing, biking, and walking can contribute substantially to this goal. A variety of pricing
policies and incentive packages can also help to reduce VMT. Developing better planning
methods and regulations, and increasing funding of multiple modes of transportation will be key
components in achieving these goals.
As part of the development of the inventory and forecast (I&F) of Kentucky’s GHG emissions,
emission projections were developed for a lower-VMT future, which show that simply reducing

6-2

the growth in VMT produces a much lower projection of overall emissions. Figure 6-2 displays
the alternate GHG projection, which shows an emissions level of only 43 MMtCO2e by 2030,
rather than the 57 MMtCO2e figure under the standard assumption.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The TLU Technical Work Group (TWG) developed recommendations for 10 policies (see Table
6-1) that were then reviewed, revised, and ultimately approved by the Kentucky Climate Action
Plan Council (KCAPC) members present and voting. The KCAPC recommends for the
Secretary’s consideration a set of 10 policies for the TLU sector that offer the potential for major
economic benefits and GHG emission savings. In fact, while all policies are expected to reduce
emissions, three-quarters of those policies for which economic impacts were estimated are also
expected to produce a net savings or economic benefit to Kentucky’s economy.

Note: The numbering used to denote the above pending priority policy options is for reference purposes only; it does
not reflect prioritization among these important draft policy options.

The U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) contains a provision to increase
the corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of light-duty vehicles (passenger cars and light
trucks) to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The I&F includes the CAFE and some partial compliance

6-4

with EISA’s Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS2) provisions. Increases in vehicle fuel economy
resulting from EISA will lead to reduced CO2 emissions from on-road vehicles. The effect of the
new CAFE standards was accounted for prior to developing the estimates of GHG reductions
from the various TLU policy recommendations discussed below.

6-5

Transportation and Land Use Sectors Policy Descriptions
The policy recommendations described briefly here not only result in significant emission
reductions and cost savings, but also offer a host of additional benefits, such as reduced local air
pollution; more livable, healthier communities; and increased transportation choices. Policies
seeking to improve travel choices and reduce VMT would have the additional effect of reducing
congestion and improving travel times and travel-time reliability, while allowing vehicles to idle
less and operate at speeds where they are more efficient. Policies improving the efficiency of
vehicles and supplying cleaner fuels would make those miles driven less emissions-intensive.
Overall, most policies produce significant fuel savings, which results in savings directly to the
driving public and to businesses. In several cases, these savings overwhelm any costs to comply
with regulation or to implement new programs.
TLU-1.

Bicycle and Pedestrian Comprehensive Plan and Infrastructure Development

This policy attempts to develop and promote sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and shared-use paths to
increase pedestrian and bicycle travel, which will reduce energy demands and GHG emissions
associated with automobile use. Today, increases in population and automobile use have resulted
in complex transportation systems that accommodate more traffic, while often ignoring the needs
of non-drivers. To maximize utilization of bicycle and pedestrian systems, sound guidance
should be applied to future bicycle and pedestrian planning in Kentucky.
To encourage bicycling and walking, some roadways and developments need be retrofitted to
make these activities easier and more inviting. A bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly community
should provide facilities that allow people to bicycle and walk safely. While many roads are
usable for local bicycling, others are undesirable because of excessive traffic and high speeds.
Also, people may be walking less these days due to a lack of pedestrian accommodations. Since
providing facilities alone may not lead to a change in behavior, downtown revitalization and
density and mixed-use development planning are equally important to increase pedestrian and
bicycle travel.
TLU-2/6.

Livability, Brownfield Redevelopment, Downtown Revitalization, Location-Efficient
Strategies, Land Use, Building Code Reform, and Connectivity

This policy bundle is intended to increase the number of walkable, bikable, compact, and mixeduse communities; provide incentives for their development; and extend these concepts wherever
feasible in Kentucky. In addition, these policies encourage infill development, increase density in
support of transit services, and thus promote preservation of undeveloped land outside urbanized
areas.
These development practices are proven to reduce VMT and the associated GHG emissions. As a
co-benefit, they also produce a built environment, which requires less extensive infrastructure to
support a given population and employment base, resulting in lower capital, operating, and
maintenance costs for the provision of water, sewer, and utility services.

6-6

TLU-3A.

Transportation System Management

Transportation system management (TSM) is the concept of pairing transportation demand with
transportation supply to help transportation networks serve the demand effectively and
efficiently. TSM strategies can reduce the number of trips taken by SOVs, shorten trip lengths,
reduce delay, increase the reliability of the network, and reduce idling (and/or other
transportation actions that increase GHG emissions). The goal of TSM is to reduce the daily
VMT per capita on the transportation network. An added benefit of effective TSM is reduced
vehicle hours traveled (VHT) per capita, which measures the amount of traffic congestion delay.
Both reduced VMT and reduced VHT are highly correlated with reduced GHG emissions.
TSM attempts to both improve transportation system performance and alter travel behavior
through a combination of technological improvements, incentives, design, and restrictions.
Technological improvements include traffic signal coordination, traveler information displays,
lane management, real-time monitoring of traffic conditions to adapt/improve operations, and
other intelligent transportation system applications. Incentives can include policies that
financially favor desired behavior or allow users to gain a time advantage and include value
pricing and smart parking strategies. System design includes access management; intersection
improvements; bottleneck removal; and integrated, interconnected, intermodal systems to serve
the mobility needs of people and goods and foster economic growth. Restrictions can prevent
people from performing certain actions that would undermine the efficiency of the transportation
system.
TLU-3B/4. Transit Management and Infrastructure

Transit management and infrastructure strategies are intended to make public transit a legitimate
transportation choice for the citizens of Kentucky, which will reduce transportation related
energy demand and GHG emissions. According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, the
national average rate of CO2 emissions per passenger-mile for bus transit is only two-thirds of
that for private automobiles. When buses operate with all seats occupied, that fraction is reduced
to less than one-fifth. Therefore, public transportation improvements are essential to reduce GHG
emissions associated with transportation.
An important strategy in reducing GHG emissions produced from transportation sources is to
reduce the growth rate in per-capita VMT. Providing alternatives to SOV can reduce the number
of trips and VMT on the highway system. Modal alternatives can include bus transit and
paratransit, rail transit, ride sharing, and vanpools. A higher rate of transit use can be achieved by
efforts to expand transit services, ensure the safety and security of transit systems, and educate
the public about transit options available in their community. The competitiveness of transit can
be enhanced by providing livable, walkable, complete streets where transit can be cost-effective.
TLU-5.

Education and Outreach for Vehicle Maintenance, Idle Reduction, and Co-Driving, and
Promote Alternative Modes of Travel

Individual behaviors can influence the ability of Kentucky to meet its objectives of reducing
energy demand and GHG emissions. The education and outreach policy is designed to inform
citizens of how they can save energy, reduce costs, and protect the environment through their
6-7

daily activities. To achieve the objective of a more informed citizenry, a comprehensive and
coordinated education outreach program is required. Fuel efficiency improvement and promotion
of alternative transportation modes are two key areas that have been identified as critical for
raising awareness.
The education and outreach effort can take many forms. Kentucky can seek opportunities to
cooperate and partner with existing promotional campaigns and public outreach. Development
and implementation of a focused multimedia campaign will be a cornerstone of the educational
program. Kentucky can also incorporate GHG messages into existing educational venues, such
as the Kentucky Driver Manual and driver education classes provided by many Kentucky high
schools. Creating a “Drive Smart–Drive Green” or other similarly monikered license plate may
raise environmental awareness and provide funding for other education initiatives. Efforts to
reach existing drivers can be made by distributing information when motor vehicle licenses or
vehicle registrations are renewed. The state can also collaborate with the insurance industry to
reduce insurance rates for drivers who have completed “green drivers training” and pledged to
follow the guidelines.
TLU-7.

Parking Management and Ride Sharing

The parking management and ride sharing strategy is intended to reduce GHG emissions and
reduce fuel consumption by reducing the number of SOV trips. Parking management refers to
policies and programs that result in more efficient use of parking resources. Reserved and
preferential parking for high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs) near places of employment will further
provide incentives to reduce SOV trips. HOV parking may be reserved at preferential locations,
such as near building entrances or parking garage exits. Free or reduced-fee parking for HOVs
may also be provided. Similarly, preferential parking and incentives can also be offered to
drivers of vehicles with low GHG emission rates. Depending on effectiveness, these incentives
could include preferential vehicle access to metered parking spaces or HOV lanes.
Providing safe and convenient park-and-ride lots will facilitate the use of carpooling, vanpooling,
and transit. Most utilized park-and-ride lots are usually built in highly visible locations and have
direct access to transit if available. Locating park-and-ride facilities near HOV-only highway
lanes would complement this strategy. Promoting carpooling and vanpooling through ride share
matching, marketing, and public awareness can encourage transition to HOVs for work trips.
TLU-8.

Strategies to Move Freight in More GHG-Efficient Ways

On-road trucking continues to transport a majority of commercial goods, not just in Kentucky
but throughout the United States. On a national level, the trucking industry delivers over 70%
(by weight) of all the freight transported. In Kentucky, over 72% of the freight tonnage and over
90% of all commodities are delivered by truck. Shifting freight from trucks to barge and rail will
decrease impacts on highway infrastructure and reduce GHG emissions, because these modes are
able to move more freight by weight on the same amount of energy than are individual heavy
trucks. The development of warehouses or distribution in the rural areas surrounding the larger
cities in Kentucky is needed to improve the efficiency of the supply chain. With additional
distribution space, the ability to coordinate freight movements in non-peak times will increase,
resulting in reduced congestion and GHG emissions.
6-8

Trucks, too, can easily be made more fuel-efficient. Existing technologies, such as aerodynamic
baffling on tractors and trailers, auxiliary power units to reduce idling, and sensors that allow
trucks to pass weigh-in stations without stopping and idling, all offer emissions reductions from
existing operations. These changes take effect without disrupting current freight logistics or
requiring intensive capital investment.
Even with improvements, the challenge of significantly reducing GHG emissions within the
trucking industry is very difficult. Intermodal freight movement can be more efficient than
moving that same freight by a single mode of transport, but that benefit depends on the distance,
weight, and time sensitivity of the shipment. The tonnage of freight moved by intermodal
transportation in Kentucky is well below the national average. Kentucky has the opportunity to
develop a strong intermodal infrastructure by improving intermodal connectors to increase rail
and river capacity.
TLU-9.

Promote Consumption of Locally Produced Goods and Services

Today, it is convenient to buy distantly produced goods (including food) whose retail prices
appear to be cheaper. However, these “cheaper” goods are not always the most beneficial to
Kentucky’s economy, as there are hidden economic, environmental, and societal costs related to
transporting distant products. Most produce in the United States is picked four to seven days
before being placed on supermarket shelves, and is shipped for an average of 1,500 miles before
being sold. This policy supports “buy local” programs, such as the Kentucky Department of
Agriculture’s Kentucky Proud marketing campaign, which promotes local cycling of dollars and
resources, and reduces the need to haul freight.
This policy will facilitate the purchase of local goods (particularly agricultural products) and
services produced in Kentucky. It will build on current initiatives wherever possible, such as the
Kentucky Proud program, and may also entail the creation of new partnerships and initiatives.
Its impacts are expected to include not only GHG emission reductions from reduced total freight
travel, but also increased economic development as in-state producers are benefited.
TLU-10.

Promote the Use of Alternative Transportation Fuels

Increasing use of alternative transportation fuels has the potential to result in savings of imported
petroleum-based fuels and reduce the associated GHG emissions. State and local governments
have the potential to “lead by example” by increasing the use of alternative transportation fuels
in fleet vehicles.
Nationally, the U.S. transportation sector is not on track to achieve the targets for biofuels use set
out in the RFS2 provisions; state policy can help to improve that performance. State policy can
also encourage the adoption of domestically produced natural gas or electricity as well,
displacing petroleum even further and offering economic benefits that come with domestic
production and lower consumer costs.
In general, this promotion policy can take three forms. One option is to adopt a low-carbon fuel
standard, which would require a certain amount or percentage of fuel sold within Kentucky to be
a low-carbon fuel (e.g., ethanol or biodiesel). This percentage can gradually increase over time
6-9

and the state can help facilitate transition to low-carbon fuels by regulating quality standards for
fuel blends. A second option is to encourage alternative fuel production through state fuel
procurement. This might require minimum volumes of cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel to be
blended into gasoline and diesel fuel, commensurate with specified in-state production of these
biofuels. This option will ensure a market for biofuel producers within Kentucky. A third option
is to directly or indirectly provide incentives to private providers of alternative-fuel
infrastructure. The development of an alternative-fuel infrastructure can aid in the promotion of
alternative-fuel use and offset the expense of equipment and installation costs.
The policy selected in Kentucky would utilize biofuels produced within the state as part of the
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste sector recommendations of this final report. This policy
represented hundreds of millions of gallons of both ethanol and biodiesel, largely produced from
sources, such as cellulosic and woody biomass feedstocks, which offer better GHG-reduction
potentials than conventional corn-based biofuels. These fuels were utilized to the extent possible
as blends with gas and diesel that could be used in the existing fleet, in order to avoid forcing
technology upgrades, which could be expensive and economically burdensome to impose.
TLU-11.

Promote the Use of Clean Vehicles

Increasing use of cleaner vehicles has the potential to save imported petroleum-based fuels and
reduce the associated GHG emissions. This policy is designed to reduce Kentucky’s energy
demands, as well as GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Clean vehicles reduce GHG
emissions through fuel efficiency, advanced vehicle technologies, and/or use of low-carbon
fuels. The use of clean vehicles can be promoted through incentives and education.
Clean vehicles include plug-in hybrids, natural gas vehicles, high-efficiency vehicles, hybridelectric vehicles, electric vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, and clean diesel hybrid vehicles. Diesel
vehicles have excellent fuel economy. When paired with up-to-date pollution-reduction devices
either by retrofitting older vehicles or as required for new models (collectively referred to as
“clean diesel” technologies), they can be an effective means to reduce GHGs.
The policy is oriented toward creating a financial incentive offered directly to consumers, which
would provide a rebate on the purchase price of a new vehicle if that vehicle is significantly
above the average for fuel efficiency of new vehicles, while also applying an additional fee to the
purchase of vehicles significantly below the new-vehicle fuel efficiency average. The program’s
design is intended to be revenue-neutral, meaning that the revenue collected in fees on gas
guzzlers is intended to be only enough to fund the incentives paid out to buyers of clean vehicles,
thus costing the government nothing to implement. Research has indicated such incentives, when
set at levels between $500 and $1,000 for both the incentive and the fee, can have a significant
and rapid effect on the types of vehicles people buy. They are also intended to offset the
tendency consumers have to underestimate the difference in costs of fuel use over many years
between more efficient and less efficient vehicles.

Chapter 7
Cross-Cutting Issues
Overview of Cross-Cutting Issues
Some issues relating to climate policy cut across multiple, or even all, sectors. The Kentucky
Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) addressed such issues explicitly in a separate CrossCutting Issues (CCI) Technical Work Group (TWG). Cross-cutting recommendations typically
encourage, enable, or otherwise support emission mitigation activities and/or other climate
actions. The types of policies considered for this sector are not readily quantifiable in terms of
greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and costs or cost savings. Nonetheless, if successfully
implemented, they would most likely contribute to GHG emission reductions and implementation
of the KCAPC’s policy recommendations described in Chapters 3–6 of this report.
The CCI TWG developed eight policy recommendations for the Secretary’s consideration (see
Table 7-1) that were then reviewed, revised, and ultimately approved by the KCAPC members
present and voting. Seven of the recommendations focus on enabling GHG emission reductions
and mitigation activities, while one (CCI-3–Adaptation and Vulnerability) addresses adaptation to
the changes expected from the effects of GHGs that will remain in the atmosphere for decades.

prioritization among these important policy recommendations.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The KCAPC was charged with developing proposed GHG reduction goals for Kentucky, along
with a set of policy recommendations designed to achieve such goals. The KCAPC is
recommending a goal of reducing projected GHG emissions to 20% below 1990 levels by 2030.
In addition to the GHG reduction goal, the KCAPC recommends that goals and targets for
energy efficiency and energy intensity for each economic sector be developed in the near future
to complement the overall GHG reduction goal.
The KCAPC based its recommendations on its review of the potential overall emission reduction
estimates (as compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast for business as usual) for
35 of 48 policy recommendations for which emission reductions were quantified. It also
considered in its deliberations the goals and targets included in Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for
Energy Independence. 1 While some of the other KCAPC policy recommendations were not
readily quantifiable, some of them would most likely achieve or contribute to additional
reductions, including several of the CCI policy recommendations.
A key challenge for the Commonwealth will be developing sector-specific goals, targets, and
metrics for energy efficiency and energy intensity and integrating them with the GHG reduction
goals. This process will require sector-specific data and the need to engage relevant stakeholders
in the effort.
An additional challenge for the Commonwealth in seeking to achieve these GHG reduction,
energy efficiency, and energy intensity goals will be to identify available resources needed to
finance and implement many of the initiatives outlined in this report, particularly given the
struggling economic conditions in the state and across the country. The KCAPC will need to
work closely with other state, local, federal, and tribal governmental entities, the private sector,
higher education institutions, citizens, and others to examine these opportunities.
Another key challenge for the Commonwealth is the need to proactively engage with the federal
government in developing appropriate federal programs and policies that will not impair
Kentucky’s economy, and simultaneously work with other state and regional entities to design
and implement strategies most effectively employed at the state and regional levels.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
Cross-cutting issues include policies that apply across the board to all sectors and activities.
Cross-cutting recommendations typically encourage, enable, or otherwise support emission
mitigation activities and/or other climate actions. All are enabling policies that are not quantified
in terms of tons of GHG reduction or costs.

Energy Independence, November 2008.
7-2

Detailed descriptions of the individual CCI policy recommendations as presented to and
approved by the KCAPC can be found in Appendix I of this report. A few of the key highlights
of the Cross-Cutting Issues Policy Recommendations are:
•

Kentucky should establish a GHG reduction goal of achieving a 20% reduction of GHGs
below 1990 levels by 2030. It should also establish sector-specific energy efficiency and
energy intensity goals, targets, and metrics through a proactive stakeholder process.

•

Kentucky should update its GHG Emission Inventory and Forecast report biennially.

•

The Commonwealth should prepare a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of the impacts
of climate change and prepare appropriate adaptation strategies to address the key impacts.

•

Kentucky should build upon current energy efficiency initiatives to expand its state “lead by
example” efforts, and should develop a tool kit and help desk to assist local governments in
doing likewise. Significant investment in education and outreach should be an integral
element of this effort.

•

The Commonwealth should develop alternative financing mechanisms to fund the policy
recommendations contained in the KCAPC-recommended Climate Action Plan.

•

In collaboration with neighboring states or states with similar economic circumstances,
Kentucky should conduct an impact analysis of federal GHG constraints on Kentucky, and
should partner with these states in striving to influence federal policy to be sensitive to
Kentucky’s concerns.

Cross-Cutting Issues Policy Descriptions

CCI-1.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Inventories, Forecasts, Reporting, and Registry

A comprehensive Kentucky GHG Emissions Inventory and Forecast (I&F) was completed by the
KCAPC in 2010. The inventory includes six GHGs—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6)—and weights these gases according to global warming potentials reported by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The I&F provides a baseline of GHG emissions from
1990 through 2010 and projects GHG emissions through 2030. This comprehensive GHG
emissions inventory will serve as a foundation for developing future emission projections and all
future GHG emission regulatory and programmatic requirements. KCAPC recommends that the
GHG I&F be updated biennially by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC)
using 2010 as a baseline year and 2005 as a trend benchmark year. Future GHG inventory
updates should project emissions out to 2050 in 5-year increments. The ongoing GHG I&F
process should include local governments and stakeholders. Two essential mechanisms of an
inventory are reporting and registry functions.
GHG reporting reflects the measurement and reporting of GHG emissions to support goal
development, tracking of GHG emissions, and efficient management of resources. GHG
reporting can help sources identify GHG emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks, and
potentially develop revenue associated with future GHG mandates by developing the required
infrastructure in advance. GHG reporting is a precursor for sources to participate in GHG
reduction programs, opportunities for recognition, and a GHG emission reduction registry, as
well as to secure “baseline protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions).
A GHG registry enables recording of GHG emission reductions in a central repository with
“transaction ledger” capacity to support tracking, management, and “ownership” of emission
reductions; establish baseline protection; enable recognition of environmental leadership; and/or
provide a mechanism for regional, multistate, and cross-border cooperation. Kentucky is a
member of the Climate Registry.
CCI-2.

Public Education and Outreach

The KCAPC recognizes the importance of public involvement and education regarding the issues
of climate change to enhance communication and dialogue about climate issues. Establishing
public education and outreach efforts will be key to building a broad base of awareness and
support for the recommendations of this report. The KCAPC has identified numerous strategies
over several years to do so in conjunction with academic, business, local government, and other
partners in this process. These outreach efforts are spelled out in Appendix I and are targeted to
the following audiences: state government, policymakers, future generations, community leaders
and community-based organizations, citizens, industrial and economic sectors, and local
governments.

7-4

CCI-3.

Adaptation and Vulnerability

KEEC, in coordination with other state agencies and the universities, should undertake a
comprehensive planning effort to assess the physical impacts of climate change on the natural
environment and human health, and also to identify and evaluate adaptation opportunities. The
assessment of impacts of climate change on the Commonwealth should include, but not be
limited to, impacts on water quality and quantity, agriculture, recreation, fish and wildlife
habitat, industry, and human health, and should take into account ongoing analytic efforts. To the
extent possible, the analysis should include the economic impacts on these sectors within the
Commonwealth, and should suggest adaptation strategies to minimize the effects of climate
change on them.
CCI-4.

Statewide GHG Emission Reduction, Energy Intensity, and Energy Efficiency Goals,
Targets and Metrics

The KCAPC recommends the following goals, taking into account Governor Steven Beshear’s
Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy
Independence: 2
•

GHG Emission Reductions— Reduce GHG emissions in Kentucky to 20% below 1990 levels
by 2030.

•

Energy Intensity—Develop a metric and possibly standards or goals for evaluating the energy
intensity, or CO2 emissions, per unit of product or service provided (e.g., 1 metric ton of CO2
per megawatt-hour (MWh) of power delivered, or 3 MWh used per $1 million of product
value). This is also sometimes called carbon intensity. These values are determined by
comparison to regional or national averages within the same sector and industry.

•

Energy Efficiency—Development of a metric and possibly standards or goals for gross state
product (GSP) per unit of power consumed (industrial), or less overall energy use per hour of
operation (homes, buildings, etc.). This is a means of maintaining current energy use, while
reducing overall emissions through improvements that allow more energy use or more GSP
for the same amount of fuel consumed in the process.

Kentucky should evaluate its key economic sectors, and determine baseline productivity within
each of those sectors with respect to GSP or productivity per unit of relevant GHG emissions.
The Commonwealth should develop an economic model to determine which of the three goals
above within this strategy will have the most significant positive benefit in terms of sector GSP,
while meeting national and state GHG goals. Kentucky should assign a responsible entity for this
activity. Using a stakeholder process, the Commonwealth should develop a metric for measuring
energy intensity and energy efficiency and propose specific energy intensity and efficiency
targets (in terms of appropriate units) for each sector by 2014. The goals and targets should be
reviewed within each sector periodically, with standards or targets adjusted accordingly as
regional and national equivalencies change.

State and Local Government GHG Emission Reduction, Energy Intensity, and Energy
Efficiency Activities (Lead by Example)

State agencies have already begun to “lead by example” with numerous initiatives to enhance
energy efficiency in state buildings and public schools. (See Appendix I for details about many
of these initiatives that are already underway.) To further expand and advance these efforts, the
Governor should assign or create a multi-agency body to direct ongoing state climate efforts and
to coordinate with local government efforts. The agency should establish goals and targets by the
end of 2012 to accomplish the following:
•

Increase use of alternative fuels in the state fleet, and reduce roadblocks to the development
of alternative fuel stations and recharge points for general public use.

•

Identify ways to design, encourage, and provide incentives for regional interconnected
energy systems.

•

Improve energy efficiency in all new state-funded or bonded construction, renovation, or
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) projects.

•

Incorporate energy efficiency requirements into state purchasing practices.

•

Promote culture change within state agencies and universities that promotes energy
efficiency.

•

Promulgate an appropriate no-idling policy for state vehicles.

•

Initiate other activities to advance recommendations in the state climate action plan.

•

Establish criteria and evaluation mechanisms to gauge the effectiveness of these initiatives.

The Commonwealth should adopt policies, goals, benchmarks, and reduction targets for energy
efficiency and intensity strategies for state-owned or state-operated buildings, facilities, and
vehicle fleets. To encourage broad adoption of and compliance with these new policies, the state
should develop incentives for agencies, offices, and organizations that meet or exceed these
established state benchmarks. To implement these new policies, the Governor should assign or
create a multi-agency governmental body represented by staff from the Governor’s Office and all
three branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial), to direct ongoing state
climate efforts, including coordination with local government activities. Additionally, all
programs and capital development funded through state bonding mechanisms should be required
to meet these new policies.
CCI-6.

Local GHG Emission Reduction, Energy Intensity, and Energy Efficiency Actions

Many communities across Kentucky are actively engaged in developing GHG emission
reduction strategies, are seeking energy savings through energy intensity and energy efficiency
initiatives, and are striving to achieve effective air quality improvements. These communities’
existing efforts will be encouraged and supported by the Commonwealth. Additional
communities interested in evaluating the vulnerabilities and opportunities posed by pending state
and federal legislative changes and by predicted climate change will be provided encouragement
and tools for developing a local plan of action.
7-6

To leverage these efforts, the state will develop a tool kit for local governments, institutions, and
individuals to assist in planning and implementing effective strategies. The tool kit will utilize
nationally recognized best practices (ICLEI–Local Governments for Sustainability, ENERGY
STAR, LEED, etc.) to provide assistance with GHG emission reduction, energy intensity, and
energy efficiency actions, and will collect “best lessons learned” by entities throughout the
Commonwealth. It is not the intent of the state to utilize this policy to mandate how local
governments or organizations should address this planning process. Rather, the state will be a
partner to local communities by supporting, assisting, and coordinating these efforts where
appropriate or beneficial.
The Commonwealth also recognizes that its communities need assistance with implementing
their plans. The Commonwealth should establish a help desk within the multi-agency entity
established under CCI-4 to provide assistance to communities in preparing and implementing
plans through actions to reduce energy use; educate their communities; and lead in energy
efficiency, GHG reduction, and energy intensity. The statewide process to develop consensus on
targets and goals for GHG reduction, energy efficiency, and energy intensity will serve as a
means to communicate the tools under development by the state, and most important, as a means
to listen to the needs of the local communities across the state to guide further development, both
of helpful tools and of the goals and targets themselves.
CCI-7.

Financial Policies

Recognizing that some policy decisions to reduce GHG emissions will have costs, Kentucky
must develop long-term funding to implement KCAPC-adopted actions. To accomplish this
policy, Kentucky should formulate a financial and regulatory structure that promotes investments
in cost-effective initiatives to promote improvements in energy efficiency and intensity. In order
to secure financing required to implement KCAPC-adopted actions in the long term, to ensure
efficient allocation of limited resources, and to deploy energy efficiency, and emission- and
energy intensity-reduction strategies at scales across the Commonwealth, Kentucky will strive to
achieve the following goals:
•

Establish a revolving loan program, initially funded by the legislature and supported by
receipt of low-interest payments, to fund required changes that improve energy efficiency
and reduce energy intensity, potentially structured as a performance savings contract.

•

Identify and aggressively pursue available grants, loans, and other funding to provide capital
funding and operational assistance for changes within the public and private sectors in
adapting to climate change and related policy changes.

•

Provide for an economic analysis that identifies the least-cost and most effective alternative
to improve energy efficiency and energy intensity for each goal in the Climate Action Plan.

•

Develop a marketing plan to attract appropriate investment by existing companies and new
investors in Kentucky’s resources, taking into consideration the potential for increased
energy costs.

•

Identify streamlining actions that can be implemented for permitting new businesses or
adopting revised permits for existing businesses, in order to best address changes in policy,
law, and regulation.
7-7

•

Take advantage of existing programs as vehicles for funding (e.g., Kentucky Bluegrass Turns
Green, Green Bank of Kentucky).

The Commonwealth should immediately create a point of contact within each appropriate
cabinet to aggressively seek and pursue funding from sources outside the state. All state
employees charged with this goal should coordinate with each other to ensure efficient use of
resources. The Climate Action Plan should be reviewed by the Kentucky Cabinet for Economic
Development, with appropriate assistance from the Kentucky Department for Energy
Development and Independence, and a plan of action should be developed. KEEC should also
develop a plan to streamline permitting processes and reduce regulatory barriers to
implementation of energy efficiency and energy intensity improvements.
CCI-8.

Conduct an Impact Analysis of Federal GHG Constraints on Kentucky

Kentucky is the third-largest coal producer in the United States and has an electricity generation
fleet that is more than 90% coal-fired. Approximately 49% of that power is delivered to an
industrial sector that produces automobiles, appliances, aluminum, stainless steel, chemicals, and
other products. With its high reliance on coal to meet its electric energy needs, Kentucky may be
subject to disproportionally large economic and infrastructure impacts as a result of federal
action to limit GHG emissions, relative to states with more options available to them, or relative
to states with less industrial development. It is therefore imperative for Kentucky to make its
voice and the voice of similar states heard in the national dialogue, to have a thorough
understanding of its vulnerability, and to have in place an adaptation plan if and when such
legislation or regulation is adopted (see CCI-3).
Federal legislation and regulations tend to assume that one size fits all, which is not the case for
Kentucky and several of its neighbors. For this reason, collaborative regional and multi-state
emission reduction efforts offer promise for developing compliance strategies that provide for greater
opportunities for effective and sustainable successes. Utilizing alternative energy resources, clean
coal technology, energy efficiency, and renewable resources through blended energy portfolios
can result in a more diverse energy economy with acceptable economic costs.
Any regulatory framework on emissions must be constructed in a way that does not arbitrarily
punish a Kentucky manufacturer for GHG emissions if that manufacturer is producing a greater
amount of product for equal or lesser emission levels than equivalent activities elsewhere when
adjusted for the regional energy portfolio. To avoid this disparity, a normalization approach,
taking into account the amount of energy required and the value of the products produced, should
be implemented.
Kentucky should take on a leadership role in the identification of partner states with similar
interests regarding federal GHG mitigation policies, and should work to develop partnerships
that protect the Commonwealth’s interests.

Appendix A
Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council Process
The Commonwealth of Kentucky established the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council
(KCAPC) process to identify opportunities for Kentucky to respond to the challenge of global
climate change, while becoming more energy efficient and more energy independent, and
spurring economic growth.
Recognizing the interconnectedness of energy, environment, and economic development, in June
2009 Governor Steven L. Beshear created the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet
(KEEC). Three departments within the EEC—Department for Environmental
Protection, Department for Natural Resources, and Department for Energy Development and
Independence—all participated in the Kentucky Climate Action planning process.
In December 2009, KEEC Secretary Dr. Len Peters appointed a diverse group of stakeholders
representing academia, agriculture, business, forestry, industry, environmental groups and many
levels of government to serve on the KCAPC. The Council was charged with collectively
developing a climate action plan to mitigate sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to
establish benchmarks and timetables for implementing the KCAPC recommendations.
The KCAPC was organized into five Technical Work Groups (TWGs) to determine the most
cost-effective approaches for improving energy efficiency and reducing Kentucky’s GHG)
emissions from key sectors of the economy. Additional industry experts, citizen representatives,
and academics contributed to these sector-based groups. The members of TWGs are listed in
Appendix B. The Commonwealth requested the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS), a nonprofit
research organization that has provided technical assistance and facilitation of climate planning
processes in more than 20 states, to assist in the development of the Kentucky Climate Action
Plan. CCS provided technical analysis and facilitation of meetings and assisted with the
production of this report.
A process memo between CCS and KEEC lays out the steps covered in each meeting and the full
process followed by the KCAPC during its 19 months of deliberations and analysis. See:

Executive Summary
The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared this report for the Kentucky Energy and
Environment Cabinet (KEEC). The report presents an assessment of the State’s greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon storage) from 1990 to 2030. The preliminary
draft inventory and forecast served as a starting point to assist the State, as well as the Kentucky
Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) and Technical Work Groups (TWGs), with an initial
comprehensive understanding of Kentucky’s current and possible future GHG emissions, and
thereby informed the identification and analysis of policy options for mitigating GHG
emissions. 1 The KCAPC and TWGs have reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory
and methodologies as well as alternative data and approaches for improving the draft GHG
inventory and forecast. The inventory and forecast as well as this report have been revised to
address the comments provided and approved by the KCAPC.

Emissions and Reference Case Projections (Business-as-Usual)
Kentucky’s anthropogenic GHG emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon storage) were
estimated for the period from 1990 to 2030. Historical GHG emission estimates (1990 through
2007) 2 were developed using a set of generally accepted principles and guidelines for State GHG
emissions, relying to the extent possible on Kentucky-specific data and inputs when it was
possible to do so. The reference case projections (2008-2030) are based on a compilation of
various projections of electricity generation, fuel use, and other GHG-emitting activities for
Kentucky, along with a set of simple, transparent assumptions described in the appendices of this
report.
The inventory and projections cover the six types of gases included in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas
Inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential (GWP) weighted basis. 3
As shown in Table ES-1, activities in Kentucky accounted for approximately 183 million metric
tons (MMt) of gross 4 CO2e emissions (consumption basis) in 2005, an amount equal to about

for Climate Strategies for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, January 2010.

The last year of available historical data varies by sector; ranging from 2004 to 2008.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system (IPCC, 2001). Holding everything else
constant, increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net
increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth), See: Boucher, O., et al. “Radiative Forcing of Climate Change.”

2.6% of total U.S. gross GHG emissions (based on 2005 U.S. data). 5 Kentucky’s gross GHG
emissions are rising at a faster rate than those of the nation as a whole (gross emissions exclude
carbon sinks, such as forests). Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions increased by about 34% from
1990 to 2005, while national emissions rose by 16% from 1990 to 2005. The growth in
Kentucky’s emissions from 1990 to 2005 is primarily associated with the electricity consumption
and transportation sectors.
Estimates of carbon sinks within Kentucky’s forests and soils, including urban forests, land use
changes, and agricultural soil cultivation practices, have also been included in this report. The
current estimates indicate that about 7.6 Million Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent
(MMtCO2e) emissions were stored in Kentucky biomass in 2005. This leads to net emissions of
about 176 MMtCO2e in Kentucky in 2005, an amount equal to 2.8% of total U.S. net GHG
emissions.
Figure ES-1 illustrates the State’s emissions per capita and per unit of economic output. 6 On a
per capita basis, Kentucky residents emitted about 37 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 1990,
much higher than the 1990 national per capita emissions of 25 tCO2e. Unlike the national per
capita emissions which remained nearly constant from 1990 to 2005, the Kentucky per capita
emissions increased by 19% from 1990 to 2005. The electricity supply sector shows the greatest
difference between per capita emissions in Kentucky and the US, at 22 tCO2e per capita in
Kentucky for this sector compared with 8 tCO2e per capita nationally. This is because the
electricity consumed in Kentucky relies on a high amount of coal in the generation fuel mix
relative to the US as a whole; about 90% for Kentucky versus 50% for the US in 2005. The use
of coal has led to low electricity rates in Kentucky compared to the rest of the country, which has
allowed energy-intensive industries to flourish in the state, as acknowledged in Kentucky’s
Energy Plan. 7 Like the nation as a whole, Kentucky’s economic growth exceeded emissions
growth throughout the 1990-2005 period (leading to declining estimates of GHG emissions per
unit of state product). From 1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 11% in
Kentucky and by about 26% nationally. 8
The principal sources of Kentucky’s GHG emissions are electricity consumption; transportation;
and residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use accounting for 50%, 20%, and 17% of
Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions in 2005, respectively.

The national emissions used for these comparisons are based on 2005 emissions from Inventory of US Greenhouse
Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2006, April 15, 2008, US EPA #430-R-08-005,

As illustrated in Figure ES-2 and shown numerically in Table ES-1, under the reference case
projections, Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions continue to grow, and are projected to climb to
about 248 MMtCO2e by 2030, reaching 81% above 1990 levels. As shown in Figure ES-3, the
electricity consumption sector is projected to be the largest contributor to future emissions
growth in Kentucky, followed by emissions associated with transportation, and then by
emissions associated with the increasing use of HFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) 9 .
Some data gaps exist in this analysis, particularly for the reference case projections. Key tasks
include review and revision of key emissions drivers that will be major determinants of
Kentucky’s future GHG emissions (such as the growth rate assumptions for electricity generation
and consumption, transportation fuel use, and RCI fuel use). Appendices A through H provide
the detailed methods, data sources, and assumptions for each GHG sector. Also included are
descriptions of significant uncertainties in emission estimates or methods and suggested next
steps for refinement of the inventory and forecast. Appendix I provides background information
on GHGs and climate-forcing aerosols.
GHG Reductions from Recent Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 was signed into law in
December 2007. This federal law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions
as they are implemented over the next few years. During the development of the inventory and
forecast, sufficient information was identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG
emission reductions associated with implementing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy
(CAFE) requirements in Kentucky. Further reductions in transportation emissions will be
achieved through the Obama plan for adopting the California vehicle CO2 emission standards
nationwide. The GHG emission reductions projected to be achieved by these recent federal
actions are summarized in Table ES-2. This table shows a total reduction of about 6.2 MMtCO2e
in 2030 from the business-as-usual reference case emissions, or a 2.5% reduction from the
business-as-usual emissions in 2030 for all sectors combined. GHG emission reductions
projected to be achieved by additional recent federal and state actions will be analyzed and
quantified, where possible, through the KCAPC process.

9

CFCs are also potent GHGs; they are not, however, included in GHG estimates because of concerns related to
implementation of the Montreal Protocol (See Appendix I for additional information). HFCs are used as refrigerants
in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) direct fuel use and transport sectors as well as in the industrial
sector; they are included here, however, within the industrial processes emissions.

Summary of Findings
Introduction
The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared this report for the Kentucky Energy and
Environment Cabinet (KEEC). The report presents an assessment of the State’s greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon storage) from 1990 to 2030. The preliminary
draft inventory and forecast served as a starting point to assist the State, as well as the Kentucky
Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) and Technical Work Groups (TWGs), with an initial
comprehensive understanding of Kentucky’s current and possible future GHG emissions, and
thereby informed the identification and analysis of policy options for mitigating GHG
emissions. 10 The KCAPC and TWGs have reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft
inventory and methodologies as well as alternative data and approaches for improving the draft
GHG inventory and forecast. The inventory and forecast as well as this report have been revised
to address the comments provided and approved by the KCAPC.
Emissions and Reference Case Projections (Business-as-Usual)
Kentucky’s anthropogenic GHG emissions and anthropogenic sinks (carbon storage) were
estimated for the period from 1990 to 2030. Historical GHG emission estimates (1990 through
2007) 11 were developed using a set of generally accepted principles and guidelines for State
GHG emissions inventories, as described in the “Approach” section below, relying to the extent
possible on Kentucky-specific data and inputs. The initial reference case projections (2008-2030)
are based on a compilation of various projections of electricity generation, fuel use, and other
GHG-emitting activities for Kentucky, along with a set of simple, transparent assumptions
described in the appendices of this report.
The inventory and projections cover the six gases included in the U.S. Greenhouse Gas
Inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential- (GWP-) weighted basis. 12

for Climate Strategies for the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, January 2010.
11
The last year of available historical data varies by sector; ranging from 2004 to 2008.
12
Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system (IPCC, 2001). Holding everything else
constant, increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net
increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth), See: Boucher, O., et al. “Radiative Forcing of Climate Change.”

It is important to note that the emissions estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with the
electricity sources used to meet Kentucky’s demands, corresponding to a consumption-based
approach to emissions accounting (see “Approach” section below). Another way to look at
electricity emissions is to consider the GHG emissions produced by electricity generation
facilities in the State. This report covers both methods of accounting for emissions, but for
consistency, all total results are reported as consumption-based.

Kentucky Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Sources and Trends
Table 1 provides a summary of GHG emissions estimated for Kentucky by sector for the years
1990, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030. Details on the methods and data sources
used to construct these estimates are provided in the appendices to this report. In the sections
below, we discuss GHG emission sources (positive, or gross, emissions) and sinks (negative
emissions) separately in order to identify trends, projections, and uncertainties clearly for each.
This next section of the report provides a summary of the historical emissions (1990 through
2007) followed by a summary of the reference-case projection-year emissions (2008 through
2030) and key uncertainties. We also provide an overview of the general methodology,
principles, and guidelines followed for preparing the inventories. Appendices A through H
provide the detailed methods, data sources, and assumptions for each GHG sector. Appendix I
provides background information on GHGs and climate-forcing aerosols.

Historical Emissions
Overview
In 2005, activities in Kentucky accounted for approximately 183 million metric tons (MMt) of
gross 13 CO2e emissions (consumption basis) in 2005, an amount equal to about 2.6% of total
U.S. gross GHG emissions (based on 2005 U.S. data). 14 Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions are
rising at a faster rate than those of the nation as a whole (gross emissions exclude carbon sinks,
such as forests). Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions increased by about 34% from 1990 to 2005,
while national emissions rose by 16% from 1990 to 2005. The growth in Kentucky’s emissions
from 1990 to 2005 is primarily associated with the electricity consumption and transportation
sectors.
Figure 1 illustrates the State’s emissions per capita and per unit of economic output. 15 On a per
capita basis, Kentucky residents emitted about 37 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 1990, much
higher than the 1990 national per capita emissions of 25 tCO2e. Unlike the national per capita
emissions which remained nearly constant from 1990 to 2005, the Kentucky per capita emissions
increased by 19% from 1990 to 2005. The electricity supply sector shows the greatest difference
between per capita emissions in Kentucky and the US, at 22 tCO2e per capita in Kentucky for
this sector compared with 8 tCO2e per capita nationally. This is because the electricity consumed
in Kentucky relies on a high amount of coal in the generation fuel mix relative to the US as a
whole; about 90% for Kentucky versus 50% for the US in 2005. The use of coal has led to low
electricity rates in Kentucky compared to the rest of the country, which has allowed energyintensive industries to flourish in the state, as acknowledged in Kentucky’s Energy Plan. 16 Like
the nation as a whole, Kentucky’s economic growth exceeded emissions growth throughout the
1990-2005 period (leading to declining estimates of GHG emissions per unit of state product).
From 1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 11% in Kentucky and by
about 26% nationally. 17

Figure 2 compares the contribution of gross GHG emissions by sector estimated for Kentucky to
emissions for the U.S. for year 2005. Principal sources of Kentucky’s GHG emissions are
electricity consumption; transportation; and residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel
use accounting for 50%, 20%, and 17% of Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions in 2005,
respectively.
The next largest contributor of gross GHG emissions in 2005 is the agriculture and forest fires
sector, accounting for about 4.7% of the 2005 gross GHG emissions in Kentucky. The
agriculture sector includes emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management,
agricultural soils, and agricultural burning. Forest fires include forest wildfires and prescribed
burning.
The fossil fuel industries and industrial processes each account for about 3.6% of Kentucky’s
gross GHG emissions in 2005. The fossil fuel industry sector includes GHG emissions associated
with natural gas production, processing, T&D, and pipeline fuel use, as well as with oil
production and refining and coal mining. Industrial process emissions are dominated by the use
of HFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which are rising rapidly
through the historical and projection periods. 18 Other industrial process emissions result from
CO2 released during iron and steel, cement, and lime, and manufacturing; ammonia production;
and soda ash, limestone, dolomite, and urea use. In addition, SF6 is released during the use of
electric power transmission and distribution (T&D) equipment, while aluminum production is
responsible for the release of PFCs.

18

CFCs are also potent GHGs; they are not, however, included in GHG estimates because of concerns related to
implementation of the Montreal Protocol (See Appendix I for additional information). HFCs are used as refrigerants
in the RCI and transport sectors as well as in the industrial sector; they are included here, however, within the
industrial processes emissions.

The waste management sector accounts for about 1.2% of Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions in
2005. The waste management sector is dominated by CH4 emissions from landfills, but also
includes emissions from waste combustion and wastewater management.
Figure 2. Gross GHG Emissions by Sector, 2005, Kentucky and US

Notes: Res/Com = residential and commercial fuel use sectors; emissions for the residential, commercial, and industrial fuel use
sectors are associated with the direct use of fuels (natural gas, petroleum, coal, and wood) to provide space heating, water
heating, process heating, cooking, and other energy end-uses. The commercial sector accounts for emissions associated with the
direct use of fuels by, for example, hospitals, schools, government buildings (local, county, and state), and other commercial
establishments. The industrial processes sector accounts for emissions associated with manufacturing and excludes emissions
included in the industrial fuel use sector. The transportation sector accounts for emissions associated with fuel consumption by
all on-road and non-highway vehicles. Non-highway vehicles include jet aircraft, gasoline-fueled piston aircraft, railway
locomotives, boats, and ships. Emissions from non-highway agricultural and construction equipment are included in the
industrial sector. Electricity = electricity generation sector emissions on a consumption basis (including emissions associated
with electricity imported from outside of Kentucky and excluding emissions associated with electricity exported from Kentucky
to other states).

Estimates of carbon sinks in Kentucky include urban forests, land use changes, and agricultural
soil cultivation practices. Note that forest wildfires and prescribed burning are sources of GHG
emissions are were included with the agriculture sector in Figure 2. Forestry activities and
agricultural soil cultivation practices in Kentucky are estimated to be net sinks of GHG
emissions in all years. The current estimates indicate that about 7.6 MMtCO2e were stored in
Kentucky biomass in 2005. This leads to net emissions of 176 MMtCO2e in Kentucky in 2005,
an amount equal to 2.8% of total US net GHG emissions.
A Closer Look at the Three Major Sources: Electricity Consumption, Transportation, and
RCI Fuel Use
Electricity Consumption Sector
Electricity generation in Kentucky is dominated by steam units, which are primarily fueled by
coal. Throughout the historical and forecasted periods, Kentucky power plant generation exceeds
the electricity consumed in the state. The remaining electricity generated in Kentucky is assumed
to be exported to neighboring regions. As shown in Figure 2, electricity consumption accounted
for about 50% of Kentucky’s gross GHG emissions in 2005 (about 91 MMtCO2e), which was

Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council

Center for Climate Strategies
www.climatestrategies.us

higher than the national average share of emissions from electricity consumption (34%). 19 The
GHG emissions associated with Kentucky’s electricity consumption sector increased by about 32
MMtCO2e between 1990 and 2005, accounting for 69% of the state’s growth in gross GHG
emissions in this time period.
In 2005, emissions associated with Kentucky’s electricity consumption (91 MMtCO2e) were
about 7.5 MMtCO2e lower than those associated with electricity production (98 MMtCO2e). The
higher level for production-based emissions reflects GHG emissions associated with net exports
of electricity to other states to neighboring regions. 20 Projections of electricity sales for 2008
through 2030 indicate that Kentucky will remain a net exporter of electricity. Emissions from net
electricity exports are projected to increase over the 2008-2030 period, from 4.1 MMtCO2e in
2008 to 5.7 MMtCO2e in 2030. Overall, the reference case projection indicates that productionbased emissions (associated with electricity generated in-state) will increase by about 42
MMtCO2e from 2005 levels, and consumption-based emissions (associated with electricity
consumed in-state) will increase by about 43 MMtCO2e from 2005 to 2030.
The consumption-based approach can better reflect the emissions (and emissions reductions)
associated with activities occurring in Kentucky, particularly with respect to electricity
generation, use, and efficiency improvements, and is particularly useful for policy-making.
Transportation Sector
As shown in Figure 2, the transportation sector accounted for about 20% of Kentucky’s gross
GHG emissions in 2005 (about 37 MMtCO2e), which was lower than the national average share
of emissions from transportation fuel consumption (27%). The GHG emissions associated with
Kentucky’s transportation sector increased by 10 MMtCO2e between 1990 and 2005, accounting
for about 22% of the State’s net growth in gross GHG emissions in this time period.
From 1990 through 2005, Kentucky’s GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen
steadily at an average rate of about 2.1% annually. In 2005, onroad gasoline vehicles accounted
for about 52% of transportation GHG emissions. Onroad diesel vehicles accounted for another
26% of transportation emissions, and marine vessels for roughly 10%. Air travel, rail, and other
sources (natural gas- and liquefied petroleum gas- (LPG) fueled-vehicles used in transport
applications) accounted for the remaining 13% of transportation emissions. GHG emissions from
onroad gasoline use grew 17% between 1990 and 2005. Meanwhile, GHG emissions from
onroad diesel use rose 66% during that period, suggesting rapid growth in freight movement
within or across the State. Emissions associated with marine fuel use increased by about 211%
from 1990 to 2005, while emissions associated with aviation fuel consumption increased by 45%
in the same period.
During the period from 2005 to 2030, emissions from transportation fuels are projected to rise at
a rate of 1.7% per year. This leads to an increase of 20 MMtCO2e in transportation emissions
19

For the US as a whole, there is relatively little difference between the emissions from electricity use and emissions
from electricity production, as the US imports only about 1% of its electricity, and exports even less.
20
Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in-state and out-of-state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimate reflects some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A.
Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council
www.kyclimatechange.us

Center for Climate Strategies
www.climatestrategies.us

from 2005 to 2030. The largest percentage increase in emissions over this time period is seen in
onroad diesel fuel consumption, which is projected to increase by 129% from 2005 to 2030.
Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Fuel Use Sectors
Activities in the RCI 21 sectors produce GHG emissions when fuels are combusted to provide
space heating, process heating, and other applications. In 2005, combustion of oil, natural gas,
coal, and wood in the RCI sectors contributed about 17% (about 31 MMtCO2e) of Kentucky’s
gross GHG emissions, below the RCI sector contribution for the nation (22%).
In 2005, the residential sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 13%
(3.9 MMtCO2e), the commercial sector accounted for 10% (3.1 MMtCO2e), and the industrial
sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 78% (24 MMtCO2e). Overall,
emissions for the RCI sectors (excluding those associated with electricity consumption) are
expected to decrease by 11% between 2005 and 2030 to 28 MMtCO2e. Emissions from the
residential sector are projected to increase slightly by 0.8% from 2005 to 2030. In contrast,
emissions from the commercial and industrial sectors are expected to decrease by 12% and 13%,
respectively, from 2005 to 2030.

Reference Case Projections (Business as Usual)
Relying on a variety of sources for projections, as noted below and in the appendices, we
developed a simple reference case projection of GHG emissions through 2030. As illustrated in
Figure 3 and shown numerically in Table 1, under the reference case projections, Kentucky gross
GHG emissions continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 248 MMtCO2e by 2030, 81% above
1990 levels. This equates to an annual growth rate of 1.2% per year from 2005 to 2030. Relative
to 2005, the share of emissions associated with electricity consumption, transportation, and
industrial processes increase to 54%, 23%, and 5%, respectively, in 2030. The share of emissions
from the RCI fuel use, fossil fuel industries, waste management, and agriculture sectors all
decrease by 2030, relative to 2005, to 11%, 3%, 0.8%, and 3%, respectively.
The electricity consumption sector is projected to be the largest contributor to future emissions
growth, followed by emissions from transportation, ODS substitutes (HFCs), other industrial
products, and the fossil fuel industry, as shown in Figure 4. Table 2 summarizes the growth rates
that drive the growth in the Kentucky reference case projections as well as the sources of these
data.

21

The industrial sector includes emissions associated with agricultural energy use and fuel used by the fossil fuel
production industry.

KCAPC Revisions
The following identifies the revisions that the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council made to
the inventory and reference case projections, thus explaining the differences between this report
and the initial assessment completed in January 2010:
Electric Supply: There were several major changes from the initial version of the ES GHG I&F.
First, the electricity sales forecast was changed from reliance on the AEO2009 to that of the most
recent Kentucky utility forecasts provided to the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC).
On average, this resulted in an increase in the electricity sales growth rate from about 0.5%/year
to about 1.5%/year over the 2007 to 2030 period. Second, the amount of on-site electricity use
was changed from reliance on the low levels assumed in AEO2009 to higher levels more
consistent with Kentucky experience and industry standards. On average, this resulted in an
increase in parasitic load from about 0.5% of total electricity production to 7% for coal stations
and 2% for natural gas-fired and oil-fired power stations. Third, there were several typos in the
original report denoting “imports”; these have since been corrected to “exports”. Finally, the
uncertainty section was revised to address the issue of KY-specific versus regional assumptions.
RCI Fuel Use: The changes discussed above for the electricity supply sector affecting the
changes in the electricity sales forecast also have an impact on how the electricity emissions are
allocated among the RCI sectors. This is reflected in Appendix B. In addition, a figure was added
showing the breakout of RCI emissions by RCI sector and fuel type.
Transportation: KCAPC did not recommend any changes to the reference case transportation
projections at this time. However, the KCAPC did recommend reviewing alternative VMT
projections. In response to this request, Appendix C of this report presents the Kentucky
transportation emissions under an alternative VMT growth scenario in which VMT growth
follows projected population growth. Transportation emissions in this front section of the I&F
report are unchanged from those reported in the draft I&F report.
Waste Sector:
• The landfill emissions were revised based on waste emplacement, flaring, and landfillgas-to-energy data from Solid Waste Division.

•
•

There is no controlled waste combustion in state, so default emissions for that category
were removed.
No industrial wastewater data available for key industries such as bourbon production so
industrial wastewater emissions numbers remained unchanged.

Reference Case Projections with Recent Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 was signed into law in
December 2007. This federal law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions
as they are implemented over the next few years. During the development of the inventory and
forecast, sufficient information was identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG
emission reductions associated with implementing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy
(CAFE) requirements in Kentucky. Further reductions in transportation emissions will be
achieved through the Obama plan for adopting the California vehicle CO2 emission standards
nationwide.
The GHG emission reductions projected to be achieved by this recent federal action are
summarized in Table 3. This table shows a total reduction of about 6.2 MMtCO2e in 2030 from
the business-as-usual reference case emissions, or a 2.5% reduction from the business-as-usual
emissions in 2030 for all sectors combined.
It is anticipated that the KCAPC process will result in identifying additional federal and
Kentucky-specific recent actions that will be quantified throughout the KCAPC process.
The following provides a brief summary of the component of the EISA that was analyzed as a
recent federal action.
Federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy Requirements: Subtitle A of Title I of EISA
imposes new CAFE standards beginning with the 2011 model year vehicles. The average
combined fuel economy of automobiles will be at least 35 mpg by 2020, with separate standards
applying to passenger and non-passenger automobiles. The standard will be phased in, starting
with the 2011 model year, so that the CAFE increases each year until the average fuel economy
of 35 mpg is reached by 2020.

Key Uncertainties and Next Steps
Some data gaps exist in this inventory, and particularly in the reference case projections. Key
tasks for future refinement of this inventory and forecast include review and revision of key
drivers, such as the transportation, electricity demand, and RCI fuel use growth rates that will be
major determinants of Kentucky’s future GHG emissions (See Table 2 and Figure 4). These
growth rates are driven by uncertain economic, demographic and land use trends (including
growth patterns and transportation system impacts), all of which deserve closer review and
discussion.

Approach
The principal goal of compiling the inventories and reference case projections presented in this
document is to provide the State of Kentucky with a general understanding of Kentucky’s
historical, current, and projected (expected) GHG emissions. The following sections explain the
general methodology and the general principles and guidelines followed during development of
these GHG inventories for Kentucky.
General Methodology
We prepared this analysis in consultation with Kentucky agencies, in particular, with the staff at
KEEC. The overall goal of this effort is to provide simple and straightforward estimates, with an
emphasis on robustness, consistency, and transparency. As a result, we rely on reference
forecasts from best available State and regional sources where possible. Where reliable existing
forecasts are lacking, we use straightforward spreadsheet analysis and constant growth-rate
extrapolations of historical trends rather than complex modeling.
In most cases, we follow the same approach to emissions accounting for historical inventories
used by the US EPA in its national GHG emissions inventory 22 and its guidelines for States. 23

These inventory guidelines were developed based on the guidelines from the IPCC, the
international organization responsible for developing coordinated methods for national GHG
inventories. 24 The inventory methods provide flexibility to account for local conditions. The key
sources of activity and projection data used are shown in Table 4. Table 4 also provides the
descriptions of the data provided by each source and the uses of each data set in this analysis.
General Principles and Guidelines
A key part of this effort involves the establishment and use of a set of generally accepted
accounting principles for evaluation of historical and projected GHG emissions, as follows:

24

•

Transparency: We report data sources, methods, and key assumptions to allow open
review and opportunities for additional revisions later based on input from others. In
addition, we report key uncertainties where they exist.

•

Consistency: To the extent possible, the inventory and projections were designed to be
externally consistent with current or likely future systems for State and national GHG
emission reporting. We have used the EPA tools for State inventories and projections as a
starting point. These initial estimates were then augmented and/or revised as needed to
conform with State-based inventory and base-case projection needs. For consistency in
making reference case projections, we define reference case actions for the purposes of
projections as those currently in place or reasonably expected over the time period of
analysis.

•

Priority of Existing State and Local Data Sources: In gathering data and in cases
where data sources conflicted, we placed highest priority on local and State data and
analyses, followed by regional sources, with national data or simplified assumptions such
as constant linear extrapolation of trends used as defaults where necessary.

•

Priority of Significant Emissions Sources: In general, activities with relatively small
emissions levels may not be reported with the same level of detail as other activities.

•

Comprehensive Coverage of Gases, Sectors, State Activities, and Time Periods: This
analysis aims to comprehensively cover GHG emissions associated with activities in
Kentucky. It covers all six GHGs covered by US and other national inventories: CO2,
CH4, N2O, SF6, HFCs, and PFCs. The inventory estimates are for the year 1990, with
subsequent years included up to most recently available data (typically 2007), with
projections to 2010, 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030.

•

Use of Consumption-Based Emissions Estimates: To the extent possible, we estimated
emissions that are caused by activities that occur in Kentucky. For example, we reported
emissions associated with the electricity consumed in Kentucky. The rationale for this
method of reporting is that it can more accurately reflect the impact of State-based policy
strategies such as energy efficiency on overall GHG emissions, and it resolves doublecounting and exclusion problems with multi-emissions issues. This approach can differ

from how inventories are compiled, for example, on an in-state production basis, in
particular for electricity.
For electricity, we estimate, in addition to the emissions due to fuels combusted at electricity
plants in the State, the emissions related to electricity consumed in Kentucky. This entails
accounting for the electricity sources used by Kentucky utilities to meet consumer demands. As
this analysis is refined in the future, one could also attempt to estimate other sectoral emissions
on a consumption basis, such as accounting for emissions from transportation fuel used in
Kentucky, but purchased out-of-state. In some cases, this can require venturing into the relatively
complex terrain of life-cycle analysis. In general, we recommend considering a consumptionbased approach where it will significantly improve the estimation of the emissions impact of
potential mitigation strategies. For example re-use, recycling, and source reduction can lead to
emission reductions resulting from lower energy requirements for material production (such as
paper, cardboard, and aluminum), even though production of those materials, and emissions
associated with materials production, may not occur within the State.

We considered several sources of information in the development of the inventory and forecast
of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from Kentucky power plants. These are briefly
summarized below:
 2007 EIA-906/920 Monthly Time Series Data. This is a database file available from the

Energy Information Administration (EIA) of the United States (US) Department of Energy
(DOE). The information in the database is based on information collected from utilities in
Forms EIA-906/920 and EIA-860 for the forecast Base Year of 2007. Data were extracted for
Kentucky. Data from these forms provide, among other things, fuel consumption and net
generation in power stations located in Kentucky for 2007 by plant type. This information
can be accessed from http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/eia906_920.html.
 Annual Energy Outlook 2009. This is an output of an EIA analysis using the National Energy

Modeling System (NEMS), a model that forecasts electric expansion/electricity demand in
the US. In particular, regional outputs for the East Central Area Reliability Coordination
Agreement (ECAR) region and the Southeastern Reliability Council (SERC) region were
used (see map). For the purposes of the analysis, 75% of the state was assumed to be within
SERC and the balance within ECAR. The ECAR and SERC results include forecasts of
transmission and distribution losses through the year 2030. This information is available in

Greenhouse Gas Inventory Methodology
The GHG inventory period was considered to be 1990-2007. The methodology used to develop
the Kentucky inventory of GHG emissions associated with electricity production and
consumption is based on methods developed by the IPCC and used by the USEPA in the
development of the US GHG inventory. It involved applying GHG emission factors to annual
fuel consumed in KY for the production of electricity at utility/non-utility and combined heat and
power facilities.
The GHG inventory was estimated on both a production and consumption basis. The production
estimate involved tallying up the GHG emissions associated with the operation of power plants
physically located in Kentucky, regardless of ownership. The consumption estimate involved
tallying up the GHG emissions associated with consumption of electricity in Kentucky,
regardless of where the electricity was produced.
Also, the GHG inventory was estimated based on emissions at the point of electric generation
only. That is, GHG emissions associated with the upstream fuel cycle process such as primary
fuel extraction, transport to refinery/processing stations, refining, beneficiation, and transport to
the power station are not included as these are accounted for in other parts of the overall state
GHG inventory.

The assumptions and calculation process is briefly summarized below in the bullets below. Key
Outputs for the 2007 Base Year are summarized in Table A1 and Figure A1.


Determine gross annual primary energy consumption by Kentucky power and CHP stations
by plant and fuel type. For coal, this involved determining the coal quality shares (i.e., share
of bituminous or sub-bituminous); for oil, this involved determining the oil quality shares
(i.e., share of fuel oil #2, #4, #5, and #6 used).



Determine gross annual generation associated with net power exports. This is the amount of
electric generation associated with out-of-state demand.



Multiply gross annual primary energy consumption by Kentucky power and CHP stations by
the appropriate CO2e emission factors. This provides an estimate of Kentucky GHG
inventory on a production basis.



Multiply annual gross generation associated with net power exports by the weighted average
carbon emission intensity (in units of metric tons of CO2e per megawatt-hour [tCO2e/MWh])
of the KY power supply sector. This provides an estimate of GHG emissions produced instate but associated with out-of-state electricity demand.



Subtract the emissions associated with net power exports from the production-based
emissions. This provides an estimate of the GHG inventory on a consumption basis.

Greenhouse Gas Forecast Methodology – Reference Case
The GHG forecast period was considered to be 2007 – 2030, with 2007 as the historical Base
Year. Ideally, constructing a GHG forecast should be based on detailed system planning
information for KY over the entire planning period, including information such as projected
sales, gross in-state generation, supply-side efficiency improvements, planned capacity additions
and retirements by plant type/vintage, and changes over time regarding losses associated with
on-site use and transmission and distribution (T&D).
While some of this information was available in Kentucky, some key data were not available at
the time the forecast was prepared. Therefore, it was necessary to use the data that was available
and pose working assumptions for data that was unavailable. For the period 2008 through and
including 2030, these assumptions, together with the methodological steps used for forecasting
CO2e emissions, are described below. Key Outputs are summarized in Table A2.
Total electricity sales. Growth rates were based on the Total Energy Forecast for PSC Regulated
Electric G&T Utilities as obtained from the KY PSC and were assumed as outlined below:


2008 – 2012: 2.62%/year



2012 – 2016: 1.13%/year



2016 – 2020: 1.32%/year



2020 – 2024: 1.32%/year



2024 – 2028: 1.30%/year



2028 – 2030: 1.45%/year

Coal quality. It was assumed that the coal quality used in Kentucky power stations (i.e., share of
anthracite, bituminous, lignite, sub-bituminous, and coal wastes used) was the same as the Base
Year.
Gross generation. Gross generation was calculated using the following assumptions:


The growth rate for gross generation on a production basis (i.e., net generation plus on-site
electricity use for all in-state units) was assumed to grow at the same rate as in-state sales.



The resource mix remained the same in all forecast years as in the Base Year.



Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses (in %) were assumed to be equal to the
SERC/ECAR average as reported in AEO2009.



Gross generation on a consumption basis was calculated on a pro rata basis after accounting
for T&D losses and plant-specific on-site losses.



Gross generation associated with exports was calculated as the difference between the
production and consumption estimates.

Combustion efficiency. Improvements of fuel-specific heat rates were assumed to be consistent
with trends in the SERC/ECAR average as reported in AEO2009.
Primary energy use. Primary energy use was calculated using the following assumptions:


Primary energy use by fuel type was calculated as the product of fuel-specific gross
generation and fuel-specific heat rate.

Final Kentucky GHG Inventory and Reference Case Projection
©CCS, June 2010


The production-based estimate of primary energy use was calculated as the sum of the fuelspecific calculations above



The consumption-based estimate of primary energy use was calculated by multiplying the
system heat rate by estimate of consumption-based gross generation.



The primary energy use associated with exports was calculated as the difference between the
production and consumption based estimates.

Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions. Total emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O were calculated
using the following assumptions:


Global warming potentials of 1, 21, and 310 were applied to CO2, CH4, and N2O,
respectively, in order to calculate CO2e emissions.



Oxidation factors of 0.99, 0.995, and 0.99 were applied to coal, natural gas, and oil,
respectively, in order to calculate CO2e emissions.



Production-based CO2e emissions by fuel type were calculated as the product of fuel-specific
primary energy and fuel-specific GHG emission factors.



Consumption-based CO2e emissions were calculated as the product of system CO2e
intensity (i.e., tCO2e/MWh) and the consumption-based estimate of gross generation.



The CO2e emissions associated with exports was calculated as the difference between the
production and consumption based estimates.

Key Uncertainties
Key sources of uncertainty underlying the estimates above are as follows:


For the inventory period, 1990-2007, the data used in this initial preliminary analysis are
based on state-specific, well-vetted historical data. The uncertainty associated with these
reported values is considered to be low.



For the forecast period, 2007-2030:
 Sales: The forecast relies on the most recent KY sales forecast assembled by the KY PSC

on the basis of utility Integrated Resource Plans. The uncertainty associated with these
reported values is considered to be acceptable.
 Other: Annual values in the forecast rely on simplifying assumptions regarding fuel mix,

level of exports, on-site electricity use, transmission and distribution losses, and
improvements in combustion efficiency. The uncertainty associated with these assumed
values is considered to be high.

Appendix B. Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI) Fuel
Combustion
Overview
Activities in the RCI 25 sectors produce carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide
(N2O) emissions when fuels are combusted to provide space heating, water heating, process
heating, cooking, and other energy end-uses. Carbon dioxide accounts for over 99% of these
emissions on a million metric tons (MMt) of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) basis in Kentucky. In
addition, since these sectors consume electricity, one can also attribute emissions associated with
electricity generation to these sectors in proportion to their electricity use. 26 Direct use of oil,
natural gas, coal, and wood in the RCI sectors accounted for an estimated 31 MMtCO2e of gross
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2005. 27
Emissions and Reference Case Projections
Emissions from direct fuel use were estimated using the United States Environmental Protection
Agency’s (US EPA) State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT) software and the methods
provided in the Emission Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP) guidance document for RCI
fossil and wood fuel combustion. 28 The default data used in SIT for Kentucky are from the
United States Department of Energy (US DOE) Energy Information Administration’s (EIA)
State Energy Data (SED). SIT information goes through 2007, after which emissions need to be
forecasted.
Note that the EIIP methods for the industrial sector exclude from CO2 emission estimates the
amount of carbon that is stored in products produced from fossil fuels for non-energy uses. For
example, the methods account for carbon stored in petrochemical feedstocks, and in liquefied
petroleum gases (LPG) and natural gas used as feedstocks by chemical manufacturing plants
(i.e., not used as fuel), as well as carbon stored in asphalt and road oil produced from petroleum.
The carbon storage assumptions for these products are explained in detail in the EIIP guidance
25

The industrial sector includes emissions associated with agricultural energy use and fuel used by natural gas
transmission and distribution (T&D) and oil and gas production industries.
26
Emissions associated with the electricity supply sector (presented in Appendix A) have been allocated to each of
the RCI sectors for comparison of those emissions to the fuel-consumption-based emissions presented in Appendix
B. Note that this comparison is provided for information purposes and that emissions estimated for the electricity
supply sector are not double-counted in the total emissions for the state. One could similarly allocate GHG
emissions from natural gas T&D, other fuels production, and transport-related GHG sources to the RCI sectors
based on their direct use of gas and other fuels, but we have not done so here due to the difficulty of ascribing these
emissions to particular end-users. Estimates of emissions associated with the transportation sector are provided in
Appendix C, and estimates of emissions associated with natural gas T&D are provided in Appendix E.
27
Emissions estimates from wood combustion include only N2O and CH4. Carbon dioxide emissions from biomass
combustion are assumed to be “net zero”, consistent with US EPA and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) methodologies, and any net loss of carbon stocks due to biomass fuel use should be accounted for in the land
use and forestry analysis.
28
GHG emissions were calculated using SIT, with reference to EIIP, Volume VIII: Chapter 1 “Methods for
Estimating Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Combustion of Fossil Fuels”, August 2004, and Chapter 2 “Methods for
Estimating Methane and Nitrous Oxide Emissions from Stationary Combustion”, August 2004.

document. 29 The fossil fuel types for which the EIIP methods are applied in the SIT software to
account for carbon storage include the following categories: asphalt and road oil, coking coal,
distillate fuel, feedstocks (naphtha with a boiling range of less than 401 degrees Fahrenheit),
feedstocks (other oils with boiling ranges greater than 401 degrees Fahrenheit), LPG, lubricants,
miscellaneous petroleum products, natural gas, pentanes plus, 30 petroleum coke, residual fuel,
still gas, and waxes. Data on annual consumption of the fuels in these categories as chemical
industry feedstocks were obtained from the EIA SED.
Table B1 shows historic and projected growth rates for electricity sales by sector. For 2008 to
2030, the annual growth rate in the electricity sales for all of the RCI sectors combined is
estimated to be 1.5%. Data provided by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (PSC)
included electricity sale growth rates for overall electricity sales in the state associated with
major regulated utilities. These growth rates were assumed to be representative of overall sales
for all electricity production facilities. However, electricity sale growth rates associated with the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors were not available and have been estimated based
on the approach described below.

A comparison was first made of the sector electricity sale shares for the period 1990-2008 to
discern any obvious trends that could be useful is projecting sectoral sales. This comparison is
summarized in Figure B1 and shows that noticeable trends are evident. For example, over the
1990-2008 historical period, the share of residential sales has been growing at a rate of
0.2%/year while the share of industrial sales has been declining at a rate of 0.6%/year. To
account for the fact that the “Other sales” category has been assimilated into the other sectors
from 2003 onward, an adjustment was made in which its share was assimilated pro-rata into the
other sectors on a pro-rata basis for the period 1990-2003.

For the purposes of developing an initial projection of sectoral electricity sales in Kentucky, it
was assumed that the trends in sectoral electricity sales would continue over the 2009-2030
period in a manner similar to the 1990-2008 period. Table B2 summarizes the projected shares in
2008 and 2030 after normalizing to 100%. Intervening year shares were estimated by linear
interpolation.

Once sectoral shares were estimated for each demand sector for each year in the forecast period,
these shares were multiplied by the projected total sales that had been previously calculated by
use of the Kentucky PSC’s overall electricity sale growth rates. A summary of the projected
sectoral sales is summarized in Table B3 for 2008 and 2030, together with average annual
growth rates over the 2008-2030 period. It is important to note that these sectoral electricity sale
estimates have high uncertainty bounds and should be reviewed and vetted by the RCI TWG
before they are used in any analysis of GHG mitigation options for RCI sectors.

Table B4 shows historical and projected growth rates for energy use by sector and fuel type.
Reference case emissions from direct fuel combustion were estimated based on fuel consumption
forecasts from EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (AEO2009). 31 For the RCI sectors, annual
growth rates for natural gas, oil, wood, and coal were calculated from the AEO2009 regional
forecast that EIA prepared for the East South Central modeling region. For the residential sector,
the AEO2009 annual growth rate in fuel consumption from 2007 through 2030 was normalized
using the AEO2009 population forecast and then weighted using Kentucky’s population forecast
over this period. Kentucky’s rate of population growth is expected to average about 0.73%
annually between 2007 and 2030. 32 Growth rates for the commercial and industrial sectors were
based on the AEO2009 East South Central regional estimates of growth in fuel consumption
which reflect expected responses of the economy — as simulated by the EIA’s National Energy
Modeling System — to changing fuel and electricity prices and changing technologies, as well as
to structural changes within each sector (such as shifts in subsectoral shares and in energy use
patterns).

Compound annual growth rates calculated from EIA SED historical consumption by sector and fuel type for
Kentucky. Latest year for which EIA SED information was available for each sector and fuel type is 2007.
Petroleum includes distillate fuel, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gases for all sectors plus residual oil for the
commercial and industrial sectors.

Figures for growth periods starting after 2007 are calculated from AEO2009 projections for EIA’s East South
Central region. Regional growth rates for the residential sector are adjusted for Kentucky’s projected population.

Results
Figures B2, B3, and B4 show historical and projected emissions for the RCI sectors in Kentucky
from 1990 through 2030. These figures show the emissions associated with the direct
consumption of fossil fuels and, for comparison purposes, show the share of emissions
associated with the generation of electricity consumed by each sector, allocated to the RCI
subsectors using the methodology described above.
The residential sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use and electricity was 24%
in 1990, increased to 26% in 2005, and is projected to increase slightly to 27% in 2030. The
commercial sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use and electricity use was
16% in 1990, increased to 18% in 2005, and is projected to increase to 26% by 2030. The
industrial sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use and electricity use was 60%
in 1990, decreased to 56% in 2005, and is projected to decrease to 47% by 2030. Emissions
associated with the generation of electricity to meet RCI demand accounts for about 87% of the
emissions for the residential sector, 88% of the emissions for the commercial sector, and 67% of
the emissions for the industrial sector, on average, over the 1990 to 2030 time period. From 1990
to 2030, natural gas consumption is the next highest source of emissions for the residential and
commercial sectors, accounting, on average, for about 11% and 9% of total emissions,
respectively. For the industrial sector, emissions associated with the combustion of petroleum,
coal, and natural gas account for about 16%, 9%, and 8% respectively, on average, from 1990 to
2030.

Residential Sector
Figure B2 presents the emission inventory and reference case projections for the residential
sector. Figure B2 was developed from the emissions data in Table B5a. Table B5b shows the
relative contributions of emissions associated with each fuel type to total residential sector
emissions.
For the residential sector, emissions from electricity and direct fossil fuel use in 1990 were about
20 MMtCO2e, and are estimated to increase to about 44 MMtCO2e by 2030. Emissions
associated with the generation of electricity to meet residential energy consumption demand
accounted for about 80% of total residential emissions in 1990, and are estimated to increase to
91% of total residential emissions by 2030. In 1990, natural gas consumption accounted for
about 15% of total residential emissions, and is estimated to account for about 7% of total
residential emissions by 2030. Residential sector emissions associated with the use of coal,
petroleum, and wood in 1990 were about 1.0 MMtCO2e combined, and accounted for about 5%
of total residential emissions. By 2030, emissions associated with the consumption of these three
fuels are estimated to decrease slightly to 0.7 MMtCO2e, accounting for 2% of total residential
sector emissions by that year.
For the 25-year period 2005 to 2030, residential-sector GHG emissions associated with the use
of electricity, natural gas and wood are expected to increase at average annual rates of about
1.5%, 0.2% and 0.8% respectively. Emissions associated with the use of coal and petroleum are
expected to decrease annually by about -3.0% and -0.7% respectively. Total GHG emissions for
this sector increase by an average of about 1.3% annually over the 25-year period.

about 14 MMtCO2e, and are estimated to increase to about 42 MMtCO2e by 2030. Emissions
associated with the generation of electricity to meet commercial energy consumption demand
accounted for about 81% of total commercial emissions in 1990, and are estimated to increase to
93% of total commercial emissions by 2030. In 1990, natural gas consumption accounted for
about 13% of total commercial emissions and is estimated to account for about 5% of total
commercial emissions by 2030. Commercial sector emissions associated with the use of coal,
petroleum, and wood in 1990 were about 0.9 MMtCO2e combined, and accounted for about 6%
of total commercial emissions. By 2030, emissions associated with the consumption of these
three fuels are estimated to be 0.7 MMtCO2e and to account for 2% of total commercial sector
emissions.
For the 25-year period from 2005 to 2030, commercial sector GHG emissions associated with
the use of electricity and natural gas are expected to increase at average annual rates of about
2.8%, and 0.1% respectively. Emissions associated with the use of coal, petroleum and wood are

respectively. Total GHG emissions for this sector increase by an average of about 2.5% annually
over the 25-year period.

Industrial Sector
Figure B4 presents the emission inventory and reference case projections for the industrial
sector. Figure B4 was developed from the emissions data in Table B7a. Table B7b shows the
relative contributions of emissions associated with each fuel type to total industrial sector
emissions.
For the industrial sector, emissions from electricity and direct fuel use in 1990 were about 51
MMtCO2e and are estimated to increase to about 77 MMtCO2e by 2030. Emissions associated
with the generation of electricity to meet industrial energy consumption demand accounted for
about 61% of total industrial emissions in 1990, and are estimated to increase to about 73% of
total industrial emissions by 2030. In 1990, natural gas consumption accounted for about 8% of
total industrial emissions, and is estimated to decrease slightly to 7% of total industrial emissions
by 2030. Coal consumption accounted for about 16% of total industrial emissions in 1990, and is
estimated to decline to about 6% of total industrial emissions by 2030. In 1990, petroleum
consumption accounted for about 15% of total industrial emissions, and is estimated to decrease
to about 14% of total industrial emissions by 2030. Emissions associated with wood
consumption by the industrial sector are about 0.1% of total emissions or less from 1990 through
2030.
For the 25-year period from 2005 to 2030, industrial sector GHG emissions associated with the
use of electricity and wood are expected to increase at an average annual rate of about 0.9% and
0.4%, respectively. Emissions associated with the use of petroleum, coal, and natural gas are
expected to decrease annually by about -0.6%, -0.4%, and -0.5%, respectively. Total GHG
emissions for the industrial sector increase by about 0.5% annually over the 25-year period.

Key Uncertainties
Key sources of uncertainty underlying the estimates above are as follows:
•

Population and economic growth are the principal drivers for electricity and fuel use. The
reference case projections are based on regional fuel consumption projections for EIA’s
East South Central modeling region. Consequently, there are significant uncertainties
associated with the projections. Future work should attempt to base projections of GHG
emissions on fuel consumption estimates specific to Kentucky to the extent that such data
become available.

•

The AEO2009 projections assume no large long-term changes in relative fuel and
electricity prices, relative to current price levels and to US DOE projections for fuel
prices. Price changes would influence consumption levels and, to the extent that price
trends for competing fuels differ, may encourage switching among fuels, and thereby
affect emissions estimates.

Appendix C. Transportation Energy Use
Overview
The transportation sector is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
Kentucky. In 2005, carbon dioxide (CO2) accounted for about 97% of transportation GHG
emissions from fuel use. Most of the remaining GHG emissions from the transportation sector
are due to nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from gasoline engines.
Emissions and Reference Case Projections
Historical GHG emissions were estimated using the United States Environmental Protection
Agency’s (US EPA) State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT) software and the methods
provided in the Emission Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP) guidance document for the
sector. 33,34 For onroad vehicles, the CO2 emission factors are in units of pounds (lb) per million
British thermal unit (MMBtu) and the methane (CH4) and N2O emission factors are both in units
of grams per vehicle mile traveled (VMT). Key assumptions in this analysis are listed in Table
C1. The default fuel consumption data within SIT were used to estimate emissions, with the most
recently available fuel consumption data (2007 in most cases) from the United States Department
of Energy (US DOE) Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) State Energy Data (SED)
included in the SIT. 35 The default VMT data in SIT were replaced with annual VMT supplied by
the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC). 36 The State-level Kentucky VMT was allocated
to vehicle types using the default vehicle mix data in SIT from the Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) 37 .
Onroad Vehicles
Onroad vehicle gasoline and diesel emissions were projected based on VMT forecasts provided
by KYTC4 and growth rates developed from national vehicle type VMT forecasts reported in
EIA’s Annual Energy Outlook 2009 (AEO2009). The AEO2009 data were incorporated because
they indicate significantly different VMT growth rates for certain vehicle types (e.g., much
higher growth rates for heavy-duty diesel VMT compared to light-duty gasoline vehicle VMT
over this period). The procedure first applied the AEO2009 vehicle type-based national growth
rates to 2008 estimates of Kentucky VMT by vehicle type. These data were then used to
calculate the estimated proportion of total VMT by vehicle type in each year. Next, these
proportions were applied to the KYTC estimates for total projected VMT in the State for each
year, using a total annual growth rate of 2.2%, to yield the vehicle type VMT estimates. The
resulting annual VMT growth rates by vehicle type are displayed in Table C2.

fleetwide in-use fuel consumption, prior to the implementation of the new fuel efficiency
standards resulting from the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act. The resulting onroad
fuel consumption growth rates are shown in Table C3. Growth rates for projecting CO2
emissions from natural gas and LPG vehicles were calculated by allocating the AEO2009
consumption of these fuels in the East South Central region and allocating this to Kentucky
based on the ratio of the State’s projected population to the region’s projected population.
Similarly, growth rates for projecting CO2 emissions from lubricants consumption were
calculated based on the AEO2009 East South Central “other petroleum” category growth, also
normalized using state to regional population projections.

Aviation
For the aircraft sector, emission estimates for 1990 to 2007 are based on SIT methods and fuel
consumption from EIA. Emissions were projected from 2008 to 2030 using the Terminal Area
Forecast from the Federal Aviation Administration, adjusted by an estimate of improved aircraft
efficiency, from the AEO2009. To estimate changes in jet fuel consumption, aircraft operations
from air carrier, air taxi/commuter, and military aircraft were first summed for each year of
interest. The post-2007 estimates were adjusted to reflect the projected increase in national
aircraft fuel efficiency (indicated by increased number of seat miles per gallon), as reported in
AEO2009. Because AEO2009 does not estimate fuel efficiency changes for general aviation
aircraft, forecast changes in aviation gasoline consumption were based solely on the projected
number of itinerant general aviation aircraft operations in Kentucky, which was obtained from
the FAA source noted above. The resulting compound annual average growth rates are displayed
in Table C4.

Rail and Marine Vehicles
For the rail and recreational marine sectors, 1990-2007 estimates are based on SIT methods and
fuel consumption from EIA. Marine gasoline consumption was projected to 2030 based on a
linear regression of the 1990 through 2007 historical data. The historical data for rail shows no
significant positive or negative trend; therefore, no growth was assumed for this sector.

©CCS, June 2010

For the commercial marine sector (marine diesel and residual fuel), 1990-2007 emission
estimates are based on SIT emission rates applied to estimates of Kentucky marine vessel diesel
and residual fuel consumption. Because the SIT default relies on marine vessel fuel consumption
estimates that represent the State in which fuel is sold rather than consumed, an alternative
method was used to estimate Kentucky marine vessel fuel consumption. Kentucky fuel
consumption estimates were developed by allocating 1990-2007 national diesel and residual oil
vessel bunkering fuel consumption estimates obtained from EIA, excluding fuel used for
international bunkering. 38 Marine vessel fuel consumption data were allocated to Kentucky using
the marine vessel activity allocation methods/data compiled to support the development of
EPA’s National Emissions Inventory (NEI). 39 In keeping with the NEI, 75% of each year’s
distillate fuel and 25% of each year’s residual fuel were assumed to be consumed within the port
area (remaining consumption was assumed to occur while ships are underway). National port
area fuel consumption was allocated to Kentucky based on year-specific freight tonnage data by
state as reported in “Waterborne Commerce of the United States, Part 5 – Waterways and
Harbors National Summaries.” 40 Growth rates for the commercial marine sector were calculated
based on a forecasted trend of the resulting historical diesel and residual commercial marine fuel
consumption.
The resulting compound annual average growth rates for the rail and marine categories are
displayed in Table C5.

including nonroad vehicles such as snowmobiles and dirt bikes, are included in the inventory and
forecast for the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors (see Appendix B). Table C6
shows how EIA divides gasoline and diesel fuel consumption between the transportation,
commercial, and industrial sectors.

Results
As shown in Figure C1, onroad gasoline and diesel consumption accounts for the largest share of
transportation GHG emissions. Emissions from onroad gasoline vehicles increased by about 17%
from 1990 to 2005 to account for 61% of total transportation emissions in 2005. GHG emissions
from onroad diesel fuel consumption increased by 66% from 1990 to 2005, and by 2005
accounted for 23% of GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Emissions from boats and
ships along Kentucky waterways accounted for 4% of transportation emissions in 2005. Aircraft
emissions increased 45% between 1990 and 2005, and made up 8% of Kentucky transportation
emissions in 2005. Rail emissions increase by 1% between 1990 and 2005, and made up 4% of
Kentucky’s transportation emissions in 2005. Emissions from all other categories combined
(natural gas and LPG, and oxidation of lubricants) contributed less than 1% of total
transportation emissions in 2005.
GHG emissions from all onroad vehicles combined are projected to increase by 75% between
2005 and 2030. This growth comes primarily from the diesel sector, with onroad gasoline
emissions projected to increase 48% and emissions from onroad diesel consumption projected to
increase by 129% between 2005 and 2030. Kentucky emissions from boats and ships decrease
53% over the forecast period. Similarly, emissions from aviation fuels are projected to decrease
by 22% between 2005 and 2030. See Table C7 and Figure C1 for more information.

Sensitivity Test Results Based Upon Alternative VMT Forecast
The Transportation and Land Use Technical Working Group (TLU TWG) recommended to the
KCAPC that an alternative VMT forecast be developed to determine the sensitivity of
transportation emissions to the VMT growth assumptions in the BAU reference case projections.
This recommendation was based on a concern that the BAU VMT annual growth rate of 2.2%
does not reflect recent Kentucky or national historical patterns in VMT. The KCAPC approved
the development of an alternative growth scenario that shows about 20% increase in VMT
between 2005 and 2030 based upon an assumption that VMT growth mirrors projected
population growth. With the approval of this recommendation by the KCAPC, an alternative
VMT projection was developed with the results presented here.
The annual growth rates from the official state forecast for population growth 41 for each year
were applied to the latest historical year of VMT data, 2008, through 2030. These alternative
VMT estimates were then used as the only change from the BAU GHG reference case projection
in order to produce a ‘sensitivity analysis’ result for a forecast of transportation sector GHG
emissions.
Table C8 shows the VMT annual growth rates used in the alternative sensitivity test analysis.
Table C9 shows the annual fuel consumption growth rates that result from the alternative VMT

forecast. Table C10 shows the transportation GHG emissions forecast using the alternative VMT
projections. The sensitivity test shows that the alternative VMT growth rates produce a
significant difference in forecast GHG emissions for on-road vehicles. The baseline forecast for
onroad gasoline GHG emissions is 28.5 MMtCO2e in the year 2030, while the alternative
scenario produces an estimate of 20.4 MMtCO2e, which represents a difference of 8.1
MMtCO2e. The baseline forecast for onroad diesel GHG emissions is 22.0 MMtCO2e for the
year 2030, while the alternative scenario produces an estimate of 15.7 MMtCO2e, which
represents a difference of 6.3 MMtCO2e. The overall GHG forecast estimate for the
transportation and land use sector changes from 56.9 MMtCO2e in 2030 to 42.6 MMtCO2e,
which represents a difference of 14.3 MMtCO2e in 2030.

Figure C2. Transportation GHG Emissions by Source and Fuel using Alternate VMT
Projections, 1990-2030

Key Uncertainties
Uncertainties in Onroad Fuel Consumption
A major uncertainty in this analysis is the conversion of the projected VMT to fuel consumption.
These are based on first allocating Kentucky’s total VMT projections by vehicle type using
national vehicle type growth projections from AEO2009 modeling, which may not reflect
Kentucky conditions. The conversion of the VMT data to fuel consumption also includes
national assumptions regarding fuel economy by vehicle type.
Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007
The reference case projections documented here do not include the corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) or biofuels provisions (or any other provisions) of the Energy Independence
and Security Act of 2007. Increases in vehicle fuel economy resulting from this act would lead to
reduced CO2 emissions from onroad vehicles. Reductions attributable to the CAFE provisions of
this Act are quantified as a recent action.
Uncertainties in Aviation Fuel Consumption
The jet fuel and aviation gasoline fuel consumption from EIA is actually fuel purchased in the
state, and therefore includes fuel consumed during state-to-state flights and international flights.
The fuel consumption associated with international air flights should not be included in the state
inventory; however, data were not available to subtract this consumption from total jet fuel
estimates. Another uncertainty associated with aviation emissions is the use of general aviation

forecasts to project aviation gasoline consumption. General aviation aircraft consume both jet
fuel and aviation gasoline, but fuel specific data were not available.
Uncertainties in Marine Fuel Consumption
There are several assumptions that introduce uncertainty into the estimates of commercial marine
fuel consumption. These assumptions include:
•

75% of marine diesel and 25% of residual fuel is consumed in port

•

The proportion of freight tonnage at ports in Kentucky to the total national freight tonnage
reflects the proportion of national marine fuel that is consumed in Kentucky.

Appendix D. Industrial Processes
Overview
Emissions in the industrial processes category span a wide range of activities, and reflect noncombustion sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from several industries. The industrial
processes that exist in Kentucky, and for which emissions are estimated in this inventory, include
the following:
•

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from:
-

Production of cement, lime, iron and steel, and ammonia; 42

-

Consumption of limestone, dolomite, and soda ash;

•

Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) from transformers used in electric power transmission and
distribution (T&D) systems;

•

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs) from consumption of
substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (ODS) used in cooling and refrigeration
equipment; and

•

PFCs from aluminum production.

Other industrial processes that are sources of GHG emissions but are not found in Kentucky
include the following:
•

CO2 from taconite production;

•

Nitrous oxide (N2O) from nitric and adipic acid production;

•

HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 from semiconductor manufacturing;

•

SF6 from magnesium production and processing; and

•

HFCs from HCFC-22 production.

Emissions and Reference Case Projections
Greenhouse gas emissions for 1990 through 2006 were estimated using the United States
Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT)
software, and the methods provided in the Emission Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP)
guidance document for this sector.43 Table D1 identifies for each emissions source category the
information needed for input into SIT to calculate emissions, the data sources used for the
analysis described here, and the historical years for which emissions were calculated based on
the availability of data.

42

Note that CO2 emissions from urea application is estimated as part of the same category as ammonia production.
GHG emissions were calculated using SIT, with reference to EIIP, Volume VIII: Chapter. 6. “Methods for
Estimating Non-Energy Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Industrial Processes”, August 2004. Referred to as “EIIP”
below.

Table D2 lists the data and methods that were used to estimate future activity levels related to
industrial process emissions and the annual compound growth rates computed from the
data/methods for the reference case projections. Because available forecast information is
generally for economic sectors that are too broad to reflect trends in the specific emissions
producing processes, the majority of projections are based on historical activity trends. In
particular, state historical trends were analyzed for three periods: 1990-2006, 1995-2006, and
2000-2006 (or the closest available approximation of these periods). A no growth assumption
was assumed when the historical periods indicated divergent activity trends (i.e., growth in
certain periods and decline in other periods). In cases where the historical periods indicated
either continual growth or decline, the smallest annual rate of growth/decline was selected from
the values computed for each period. This conservative assumption was adopted because of the
uncertainty associated with utilizing historical trends to estimate future emission activity levels.

Results
Figures D1 and D2 show historical and projected emissions for the industrial processes sector
from 1990 to 2030. Table D3 shows the historical and projected emission values upon which
Figures D1 and D2 are based. Total gross Kentucky GHG emissions were about 4.8 MMtCO2e
in 1990, 6.5 MMtCO2e in 2005, and are projected to increase to about 12.5 MMtCO2e in 2030.
Emissions from the overall industrial processes category are expected to grow by about 2.7%
annually from 2005 through2030, as shown in Figures D1 and D2, with emissions growth
primarily associated with the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs in refrigeration and air
conditioning equipment.

produced in the State. Clinker is an intermediate product from which finished Portland and
masonry cement are made. Clinker production releases CO2 when calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is
heated in a cement kiln to form lime (calcium oxide) and CO2 (see Chapter 6 of EIIP guidance
document). Emissions are calculated by multiplying annual clinker production by emission
factors to estimate emissions associated with the clinker production process (0.507 metric ton

(Mt) of CO2 emitted per Mt of clinker produced) and cement kiln dust (0.020 MtCO2 emitted per
Mt of clinker CO2 emitted).
Masonry cement requires additional lime, over and above the lime used in the clinker. During the
production of masonry cement, non-plasticizer additives such as lime, slag, and shale are added
to the cement, increasing its weight by 5%. Lime accounts for approximately 60% of the added
substances. About 0.0224 MtCO2 is emitted for every Mt of masonry cement produced, relative
to the CO2 emitted during the production of a Mt of clinker (see Chapter 6 of EIIP guidance
document).
As shown in Figure D2 and Table D3, emissions from this source are estimated to be about 0.4
MMtCO2e in 1990 and are projected to increase to about 0.7 MMtCO2e by 2030. Historical
clinker and masonry cement production data for Kentucky obtained from the USGS (see Table
D1) and the default emission factors in SIT were used to calculate CO2 emissions for 1990-2006.
Emissions were projected through 2030 using rates specific to each projection period that were
computed from Portland Cement Association’s Cement Outlook 2008.
Lime Manufacture
Lime is a manufactured product that is used in many chemical, industrial, and environmental
applications including steel making, construction, pulp and paper manufacturing, and water and
sewage treatment. Lime is manufactured by heating limestone (mostly CaCO3) in a kiln, creating
calcium oxide and CO2. The CO2 is driven off as a gas and is normally emitted to the
atmosphere, leaving behind a product known as quicklime. Some of this quicklime undergoes
slaking (combining with water), which produces hydrated lime. The consumption of lime for
certain uses, specifically the production of precipitated CaCO3 and refined sugar, results in the
reabsorption of some airborne CO2 (see Chapter 6 of EIIP guidance document.).
Emissions associated with lime manufacture were estimated for 1990 through 2006 using the
amount of lime produced and an emission factor of 0.75 MtCO2 per ton high-calcium lime and
0.87 MtCO2 per ton dolomitic lime produced. The annual growth rate was developed from an
analysis of historical growth, selecting the smallest historical annual decline in state production
(1.32% from 1996 to 2006) from each of three periods analyzed. CO2 emissions from lime
production in Kentucky were estimated at about 0.46 MMtCO2e in 1990, 0.72 MMtCO2e in
2005, and 0.94 MMtCO2e in 2030.
Limestone and Dolomite Consumption
Limestone and dolomite are basic raw materials used by a wide variety of industries, including
the construction, agriculture, chemical, glass manufacturing, and environmental pollution control
industries, as well as in metallurgical industries such as magnesium production. Emissions
associated with the use of limestone and dolomite to manufacture steel and glass and for use in
flue-gas desulfurization scrubbers to control sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion of
coal in boilers are included in the industrial processes sector. 44
44

In accordance with EIIP Chapter 6 methods, emissions associated with the following uses of limestone and
dolomite are not included in this category: (1) crushed limestone consumed for road construction or similar uses
(because these uses do not result in CO2 emissions), (2) limestone used for agricultural purposes (which is counted

Historical limestone and dolomite consumption (sales) data for Kentucky obtained from the
USGS (see Table D1) and the default emission factors in SIT were used to calculate CO2
emissions for 1990-2006. Default data were not available in the SIT for the years from 1990 to
1993, so the 1994 emissions estimate was applied to these years. Emission projections from 2007
to 2030 are held constant at 2006 levels, reflecting the conflicting trends observed for the
historical periods analyzed. Relative to total industrial non-combustion process emissions, CO2
emissions from limestone and dolomite consumption are low (about 0.31 MMtCO2e in 1990,
0.32 MMtCO2e in 2005, and 1.08 MMtCO2e in 2030).
Soda Ash Consumption
Commercial soda ash (sodium carbonate) is used in many consumer products such as glass, soap
and detergents, paper, textiles, and food. Carbon dioxide is also released when soda ash is
consumed (see Chapter 6 of EIIP guidance document). SIT estimates historical emissions based
on the state’s population and national per capita soda ash consumption from the US EPA
national GHG inventory. Growth in this category was estimated as a 1.01% annual decline based
on 2006-2016 employment projections in the Basic Chemical Manufacturing sector for
Kentucky. CO2 emissions from soda ash consumption are low, estimated at about 0.04
MMtCO2e in 1990, 0.04 MMtCO2e in 2005, and at about0.03 MMtCO2e in 2030.
Iron and Steel Production
The SIT shows production of iron and steel in Kentucky from 1997 through 2006. The
production of iron and steel generate process-related CO2 emissions. Iron is produced by
reducing iron ore with metallurgical coke in a blast furnace to produce pig iron; this process
emits CO2 emissions. Pig iron is used as a raw material in the production of steel. The production
of metallurgical coke from coking coal produces CO2 emissions as well.
The EPA SIT methodology was used to estimate Kentucky’s CO2 emissions from iron and steel
production (see Table D1). The basic activity data needed are the quantities of crude steel
produced (defined as first cast product suitable for sale or further processing) by production
method. Default SIT emission factors of 0.08 MtCO2 per Mt, 1.46 MtCO2 per Mt, and 1.72
MtCO2 per Mt production were used for EAF steel production from scrap metal, BOF production
without coke ovens, and BOF production with coke ovens, respectively. Emissions estimated for
1997 were also applied to the years 1990-1996 since the production data were missing for those
years. As shown in Figure D2 and Table D3, emissions in 1990 were 2.4 MMtCO2e and are
projected to increase slightly to about 2.7 MMtCO2e in 2030. No growth was assumed for iron
and steel emissions from 2007 to 2030 due to anomalously large historical growth rates for a
limited historical period in combination with a conflicting projected decline in Kentucky Primary
Metals employment.

Ammonia Production/Urea Application
Ammonia (NH3) and urea ((NH2)2CO) are both synthetically created chemicals with a wide
variety of uses. Ammonia is primarily used as a fertilizer, though it also has applications as a
refrigerant, a disinfectant, and in the production of chemicals such as urea and nitric acid.
Ammonia production involves the conversion of a fossil fuel hydrocarbon into pure hydrogen,
which is then combined with nitrogen to create NH3. This process involves the release of carbon
dioxide as a byproduct. Urea, a different type of synthetic chemical, is also primarily used as a
fertilizer, though it is also used commercially in several industrial and chemical processes. Urea
is created by a chemical process with ammonia as a key component.
The default production and consumption data in SIT show no ammonia production in Kentucky
over the historical period. Emissions from urea application are estimated to be fairly low at 0.011
MMtCO2e in 1990, decreasing to 0.007 in 2005, and increasing slightly to 0.008 by 2030. and
decreased to 0.49 MMtCO2e in 2005 (see blue line in Figure D2). A decline in growth of 0.41%
annually from 2007 to 2030 was applied based on the smallest historical annual decline in state
consumption from each of three periods analyzed.
Substitutes for Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS)
HFCs and PFCs are used as substitutes for ODS, most notably CFCs (CFCs are also potent
warming gases, with global warming potentials on the order of thousands of times that of CO2
per unit of emissions) in compliance with the Montreal Protocol and the Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990. 45 Even low amounts of HFC and PFC emissions, for example, from leaks
and other releases associated with normal use of the products, can lead to high GHG emissions
on a CO2e basis. Emissions in Kentucky from this sector are estimated to have increased from
0.01 MMtCO2e in 1990 to about 1.5 MMtCO2e in 2005, and to further increase to 6.3 MMtCO2e
in 2030. The projected rates of increase for these emissions are based on projections for national
emissions from the US EPA report referenced in Table D2.
Electric Power Transmission and Distribution
Emissions of SF6 from electrical equipment have experienced declines since the mid nineties,
mostly due to voluntary action by industry. Sulfur hexafluoride is used as an electrical insulator
and interrupter in the electric power T&D system. The largest use for SF6 is as an electrical
insulator in electricity T&D equipment, such as gas-insulated high-voltage circuit breakers,
substations, transformers, and transmission lines, because of its high dielectric strength and arcquenching abilities. Not all of the electric utilities in the US use SF6; use of the gas is more
common in urban areas where the space occupied by electric power T&D facilities is more
valuable. 46
45

As noted in EIIP Chapter 6, ODS substitutes are primarily associated with refrigeration and air conditioning, but
also many other uses including as fire control agents, cleaning solvents, aerosols, foam blowing agents, and in
sterilization applications. The applications, stocks, and emissions of ODS substitutes depend on technology
characteristics in a range of equipment types. For the US national inventory, a detailed stock vintaging model was
used to track ODS substitutes uses and emissions, but this modeling approach has not been completed at the state
level.

As shown in Figure D2 and Table D3, SF6 emissions from electric power T&D are about 0.60
MMtCO2e in 1990 and decrease to about 0.34 MMtCO2e in 2005. Emissions further decrease t
about 0.26 MMtCO2e in 2030. Emissions in Kentucky from 1990 to 2006 were estimated based
on the estimates of emissions per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity consumed from the US EPA
GHG inventory, and the ratio of Kentucky’s to the US electricity consumption (sales) estimates
available from the Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) Electric Power Annual and
provided in SIT (see Table D1). The national trend in US emissions estimated for 2007-2030 for
the technology-adoption scenario shows expected decreases in these emissions at the national
level (see Table D2), and the same rate of decline is assumed for emissions in Kentucky. The
decline in SF6 emissions in the future reflects expectations of future actions by the electric power
industry to reduce these emissions.
Aluminum Production
Emissions of tetrafluoromethane and hexafluoroethane, both PFCs, occur during the reduction of
alumina in the primary smelting process. The aluminum production industry is thought to be the
largest source of these two PFCs. Emissions from aluminum production are calculated in the SIT
by multiplying the quantity of aluminum produced by an emission factor of 0.4255 Mt carbon
equivalent per Mt aluminum produced.
The SIT shows aluminum production activity in Kentucky throughout the historical period.
Emissions were then projected using national growth rates based on US national emissions for
2005-2020 for a technology adoption scenario for the aluminum production industry as indicated
in Table D2. GHG emissions in Kentucky from aluminum production are estimated at 0.53
MMtCO2e in 1990, 0.46 MMtCO2e in 2005, and declining to 0.39 MMtCO2e in 2030.
Key Uncertainties
Key sources of uncertainty underlying the estimates above are as follows:
•

Since emissions from industrial processes are determined by the level of production and
the production processes of a few key industries—and in some cases, a few key plants—
there is relatively high uncertainty regarding future emissions from the industrial
processes category as a whole. Future emissions depend on the competitiveness of
Kentucky manufacturers in these industries, and the specific nature of the production
processes used in Kentucky. Emissions in this draft inventory were based on default
activity data provided in the SIT. These data should be reviewed and modified as
necessary based on actual data reported by Kentucky facilities.

•

The projected largest source of future industrial emissions, HFCs and PFCs used in
cooling applications, is subject to several uncertainties as well. Emissions through 2030
and beyond will be driven by future choices regarding mobile and stationary air
conditioning technologies and the use of refrigerants in commercial applications, for
which several options currently exist.

•

Due to the lack of reasonably specific projection surrogates, historical trend data were
used to project emission activity level changes for multiple industrial processes. There is
significant uncertainty associated with any projection, including a projection that assumes

Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council

D-10

Center for Climate Strategies

©CCS, June 2010

that past historical trends will continue in future periods. Reflecting this uncertainty, the
lowest historical annual rate of increase/decrease was selected as a conservative
assumption for use in projecting future activity level changes. These assumptions on
growth should be reviewed by industry experts and revised to reflect their expertise on
future trends especially for the cement and lime manufacture, iron and steel production,
magnesium casting, and taconite production industries.
•

For the industries for which EPA default activity data and methods were used to estimate
historical emissions, future work should include efforts to obtain state-specific data to
replace the default assumptions.

•

For the electricity T&D and semiconductor industries, future efforts should include a
survey of companies within these industries to determine the extent to which they are
implementing techniques to minimize emissions to improve the emission projections for
these industries.

Appendix E. Fossil Fuel Industries
Overview
The inventory for this subsector of the Energy Supply sector includes methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with the production, processing,
transmission, and distribution of fossil fuels in Kentucky. 47 In 2007, emissions from the
subsector accounted for an estimated 7.64 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2 equivalent (CO2e)
of total gross greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Kentucky, and are estimated to decrease to
6.90 MMtCO2e by 2030.
Emissions and Reference Case Projections
Oil and Gas Production
In 2007, Kentucky’s crude oil production totaled 7,000 barrels (bbls) per day, accounting for
only 0.1% of US production. The peak year of oil production in Kentucky was 1983 (22,000 bbls
per day). Production steadily declined until 2000 and has remained relative stable since. 48 Proved
crude oil reserves are 24 million bbls, which is also 0.1% of the US total. 49 Though Kentucky
has only minor oil production, it is home to two operating petroleum refineries located in
Catlettsburg and Somerset. Both of these primarily process petroleum received from out of state:
Catlettsburg from the Gulf Coast and Somerset from neighboring states. The crude oil distillation
capacity between the two facilities is 231,500 bbls per day. 50
Kentucky is also responsible for about 1% of the Nation’s natural gas production, the majority of
which originates in the Big Sandy field located in eastern portion of the State. In 2007, Kentucky
consumed approximately 230 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas while it produced only 95
Bcf. The majority of the difference was supplied by pipeline from the Gulf Coast. Industry is
responsible for about 50% of the natural gas consumption in the State.50
The vast majority (99%) of Kentucky’s oil and gas emissions comes from the natural gas sector,
predominantly in the production and transportation of natural gas through the State’s
transmission pipelines. Historically, pipeline fuel consumption was the leading contributor;
however, there has been a steep decline in this subsector since the mid-1990s and it now
accounts for only 17% of natural gas emissions.
Oil and Gas Industry Emissions
Emissions can occur at several stages of production, processing, transmission, and distribution of
oil and gas. Based on the information provided in the Emission Inventory Improvement Program
47

Note that emissions from natural gas consumed as lease fuel (used in well, field, and lease operations) and plant
fuel (used in natural gas processing plants) are included in Appendix B in the industrial fuel combustion category.

(EIIP) guidance 51 for estimating emissions for this sector, transmission pipelines are large
diameter, high-pressure lines that transport gas from production fields, processing plants, storage
facilities, and other sources of supply over long distances to local distribution companies or to
large volume customers. Sources of CH4 emissions from transmission pipelines include leaks,
compressor fugitives, vents, and pneumatic devices. Distribution pipelines are extensive
networks of generally small diameter, low-pressure pipelines that distribute gas within cities or
towns. Sources of CH4 emissions from distribution pipelines are leaks, meters, regulators, and
mishaps. Carbon dioxide, CH4, and N2O emissions occur as the result of the combustion of
natural gas by internal combustion engines used to operate compressor stations.
With nearly 16,600 active gas-producing wells in the state, 4 operational gas processing plants,
and more than 24,000 miles of gas pipelines, there are significant uncertainties associated with
estimates of Kentucky’s GHG emissions from this sector. This is compounded by the fact that
there are no regulatory requirements to track GHG emissions. Therefore, estimates based on
emissions measurements in Kentucky are not possible at this time.
The EPA’s State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT) facilitates the development of a rough
estimate of state-level GHG emissions. GHG emission estimates are calculated by multiplying
emissions-related activity levels (e.g., miles of pipeline, number of compressor stations) by
aggregate industry-average emission factors. Key information sources for the activity data are
the US Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) 52 and the US
Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS). 53 Emissions were estimated
using the SIT, with reference to methods/data sources outlined in the EIIP guidance document
for natural gas and oil systems. 54 Emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O associated with pipeline
natural gas combustion were estimated using SIT emission factors 55 and Kentucky’s 1990-2007
natural gas data from EIA for the “consumed as pipeline fuel” category. 56
Unfortunately OPS has not collected data from pipeline operators using a consistent set of
reporting requirements over the 1990-2007 analysis period. In particular, OPS has only required
operators to report state-level data for their transmission/gathering pipelines since 2001 and
state-level data for their distribution pipelines since 2004. Before these dates, a number of
Kentucky pipeline records report data as multi-state totals. To estimate a complete time-series of
natural gas transmission/gathering pipeline data, CCS compiled surrogate data to back-cast the
2001 transmission/gathering pipeline mileage and the 2004 distribution pipeline mileage/service
counts for each year back to 1990.

Coal Mining Emissions
Methane occurs naturally in coal seams, and is typically vented during mining operations for
safety reasons. Coal mine methane emissions are usually considerably higher, per unit of coal
produced, from underground mining than from surface mining. Underground coal mines
continue to emit CH4 the mines have been abandoned or shut down. The rate of CH4 emitted
decreases over time, and is also affected by factors such as gas content and characteristics of
coal, flooding, CH4 flow capacity of the mine, the presence of vent holes, and mine seals.
Kentucky had 417 operational coal mines (more than any other state), which together produced
more than 115 million short tons of coal in 2007. 57 Of Kentucky’s 417 coal mines in 2007, 201
were underground and 216 were surface mines. This inventory includes CH4 emissions from
operational coal mines as reported by the US EPA, and includes emissions from underground
coal mines, surface mines, and post-mining activities. 58
Table E1 provides an overview of data sources and approaches used to develop fossil fuel sector
emission estimates for Kentucky, including a description of the surrogate data that were used to
back-cast natural gas transmission/gathering and distribution pipeline mileage data for the
historical analysis period.
Emission Forecasts
Table E1 provides an overview of data sources and approaches used to develop projected fossil
fuel sector emission estimates for Kentucky. The approach to forecasting sector
emissions/activity consisted of compiling and comparing two alternative sets of annualized
growth rates for each emissions activity – one using Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2009
forecast data for each 5-year time-frame over the 2007-2030 analysis period (except the final
time period which includes 2022 to 2030), and the other using the historical 1990-2007 activity
data for each of 3 periods (i.e., 1990 to 2007, 1995 to 2007, and 2000 to 2007). Because
available AEO forecast information is for a broad region that may not reflect Kentucky-specific
trends (e.g., AEO forecasts of natural gas production are for the East South Central Region,
which includes 3 states in addition to Kentucky), the AEO forecast growth rates were only used
when they were in-line with the Kentucky historical growth rates. Therefore, some oil and gas
production sector projections are based on state-level historical activity/emissions trends. In
cases where of each the three historical periods indicated continual growth or decline, the period
with the smallest annual rate of growth/decline was used in the projection. This conservative
assumption was adopted because of the uncertainty associated with utilizing historical trends to
estimate future emission activity levels.
It is important to note that potential improvements to production, processing, and pipeline
technologies that could result in GHG emissions reductions are generally not accounted for in the
projections analysis.

Results
Table E2 displays the estimated emissions from the fossil fuel industry in Kentucky for select
years over the period 1990 to 2030. Emissions from this sector declined by 10% from 1990 to
2007 and are projected to decline by an additional 10% between 2007 and 2030. Natural gas
production and transmission and coal mining are the major contributors to both recent historic
and future year emissions.

Key Uncertainties
Key sources of uncertainty underlying the estimates above are as follows:

69

•

Current levels of fugitive emissions. These are based on industry-wide averages, and until
estimates are available for local facilities, significant uncertainties remain.

•

Due to data limitations associated with OPS reporting, natural gas distribution, gathering,
and transmission pipeline emissions in earlier years were estimated by assuming that
changes in each emissions producing activity were related to changes in activity levels
for surrogates for the emissions activity. 69

•

Because pipeline emissions are a function of both pipeline mileage/service counts and the
type of pipeline material (e.g., plastic vs. cast iron), this approach does not account for
emissions changes that would have occurred from any changes in pipeline material
between 1990 and 2004.

•

Projections of future production of fossil fuels. The assumptions used for the projections
do not reflect all potential future changes that could affect GHG emissions, including
potential changes in regulations and emissions-reducing improvements in oil and gas
production, processing, and pipeline technologies.

For example, gathering pipeline emissions were back-cast to pre-2001 years by applying the ratio of Kentucky
natural gas production in each pre-2001 year to Kentucky natural gas production in 2001.

Appendix F. Agriculture
Overview
The emissions discussed in this appendix refer to non-energy methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
(N2O) emissions from both livestock and crop production. These include emissions and sinks of
carbon dioxide (CO2) in agricultural soils. Energy emissions related to agricultural practices
(combustion of fossil fuels to power agricultural equipment) are included in the residential,
commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel consumption sector estimates (see Appendix B). The
primary GHG sources and sinks - livestock production and crop production are further
subdivided as follows:
•

•

•
•

Livestock production – enteric fermentation: CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation are
the result of normal digestive processes in ruminant and non-ruminant livestock. Microbes in
the animal digestive system break down food and emit CH4 as a by-product. More CH4 is
produced in ruminant livestock because of digestive activity in the large fore-stomach.
Livestock production – manure management: CH4 and N2O emissions from the storage and
treatment of livestock manure (e.g., in compost piles or anaerobic treatment lagoons) occur
as a result of manure decomposition. The environmental conditions of decomposition drive
the relative magnitude of emissions. In general, the more anaerobic the conditions are, the
more CH4 is produced because decomposition is aided by CH4-producing bacteria that thrive
in oxygen-limited conditions. In contrast, N2O emissions are increased under aerobic
conditions.
Emission estimates from manure management are based on manure that is stored and treated
on livestock operations (e.g. dairies, feedlots, swine operations). Emissions from manure
deposited directly on land by grazing animals and emissions from manure that is applied to
agricultural soils as an amendment are accounted for in the next sector.
Livestock production, agricultural soils – livestock: this source sector covers N2O emissions
resulting from animal excretions directly on agricultural soils (e.g. pasture, paddock or range)
or manure spreading on agricultural soils.
Crop production, agricultural soils – fertilizers: The management of agricultural soils can
result in N2O emissions and net fluxes of CO2 (causing emissions or sinks). In general, soil
amendments that add nitrogen to soils can also result in N2O emissions. Nitrogen additions
drive the underlying soil nitrification and de-nitrification cycle, which produces N2O as a byproduct.
The emissions estimation methodologies used in this inventory account for several sources of
N2O emissions from agricultural soils, including decomposition of crop residues, synthetic
and organic fertilizer application, manure application, sewage sludge application, nitrogen
fixation, and histosols (high organic soils, such as wetlands or peatlands) cultivation (see
additional agricultural soils subsectors below).
Both direct and indirect emissions of N2O occur from the application of manure, fertilizer,
and sewage sludge to agricultural soils. Direct emissions occur at the site of application and
indirect emissions occur when nitrogen leaches to groundwater or in surface runoff and
enters the nitrification/denitrification cycle.

•

Crop production, agricultural soils – crops: this source sector covers N2O emissions from
decomposition of crop residues, production of nitrogen fixing crops, and the cultivation of
histosols.
Crop production, agricultural soils – liming: the practice of adding limestone and dolomite
to agricultural soils (for neutralizing acidic soil conditions) results in CO2 emissions.
Crop production, agricultural soils – rice cultivation: CH4 emissions occur during rice
cultivation; however, rice is not grown in Kentucky.
Crop production, agricultural soils – soil carbon: the net flux of CO2 in agricultural soils
depends on the balance of carbon losses from management practices and gains from organic
matter inputs to the soil. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants through photosynthesis and
ultimately becomes the carbon source for organic matter inputs to agricultural soils. When
inputs are greater than losses, the soil accumulates carbon and there is a net sink of CO2 into
agricultural soils. In addition, soil disturbance from the cultivation of histosols releases large
stores of carbon from the soil to the atmosphere in the form of CO2 (Note: N2O emissions
from cultivation of histosols are covered under the Agricultural soils - crops sector above).
Crop production, residue burning: CH4 and N2O emissions are produced when crop residues
are burned (CO2 is emitted as well, however, since the source of carbon is biogenic, these
emissions are not included in the inventory).

Emissions and Reference Case Projections
Inventory Data
GHG emissions for 1990 through 2006 were estimated using the United States Environmental
Protection Agency’s (US EPA) State Inventory Tool (SIT) software and the methods provided in
the Emission Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP) guidance document for the sector.70 In
general, the SIT methodology applies emission factors developed for the US to activity data for
the agriculture sector. Activity data include livestock population statistics, amounts of fertilizer
applied to crops, and trends in manure management practices. This methodology is based on
international guidelines developed by sector experts for preparing GHG emissions inventories. 71
Data on crop production in Kentucky from 1990 to 2006 and on the number of animals in the
state from 1990 to 2006 were obtained from the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA), National Agriculture Statistical Service (NASS) and incorporated as defaults in SIT. 72
The default SIT manure management system assumptions for each livestock category were used
for this inventory. SIT data on fertilizer usage came from Commercial Fertilizers, a report from

70

GHG emissions were calculated using SIT, with reference to Emission Inventory Improvement Program, Volume
VIII: Chapter 8. “Methods for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Livestock Manure Management”,
August 2004; Chapter 10. “Methods for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Agricultural Soil
Management”, August 2004; and Chapter 11. “Methods for Estimating Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Field
Burning of Agricultural Residues”, August 2004.

the Fertilizer Institute. Details for each of the livestock and crop production subsectors are
provided below.
Livestock production – enteric fermentation. SIT default data on livestock populations are
taken from the USDA NASS and are available from 1990-2006. Methane emission factors
specific to each type of animal by region (e.g. dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, goats, swine, and
horses) are provided in SIT.
Livestock production – manure management. The same population data used above for
enteric fermentation are also used as input to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from manure
management. Population estimates are multiplied by an estimate for typical animal mass and a
volatile solids (VS) production rate to estimate the total VS produced. The VS estimate for each
animal type is then multiplied by a maximum potential CH4 emissions factor and a weighted CH4
conversion factor to derive total CH4 emissions. The methane conversion factor adjusts the
maximum potential methane emissions based on the types of manure management systems
employed in Kentucky.
Nitrous oxide emissions are derived using the same animal population estimates above
multiplied by the typical animal mass and a total Kjeldahl nitrogen (K-nitrogen) production
factor. The total K-nitrogen is multiplied by a non-volatilization factor to determine the fraction
that is managed in manure management systems. The unvolatilized portion is then divided into
fractions that get processed in either liquid (e.g. lagoons) or solid waste management systems
(e.g. storage piles, composting). Each of these fractions is then multiplied by an N2O emission
factor, and the results summed, to estimate total N2O emissions.
Livestock and Crop Production, agricultural soils - fertilizers, crops, and livestock. The
fertilizers subsector covers direct and indirect N2O emissions from the application of synthetic
and organic fertilizers. The crops subsector covers N2O emissions from nitrogen fixing crops,
decomposition of crop residues, and cultivation of high organic content soils (histosols). The
livestock subcategory covers N2O emissions from animal excretions directly onto the land area
or from manure applied to soils as an amendment.
Emissions of N2O occur naturally as part of the nitrogen cycle. However, various soil
management practices have significantly increased the amount of N2O going into the
atmosphere. There are three source categories of nitrous oxide emissions from soil management.
The first is direct emissions from agricultural cropping practices, which occur at the site
primarily through applications of fertilizer or decomposition of crop residues, cultivation of
histosols, and through the production of nitrogen fixing crops. Data inputs used to calculate the
direct emissions from agricultural cropping practices include:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

The amount of nitrogen applied to the soil through fertilizers (synthetic and organic);
Animal population, mass and N emitted per unit of animal mass;
Amount of manure intentionally applied to soils;
Amount of residue left on cropland and the N content of such residues; and
Acreage of histosols cultivated (these data were not available for Kentucky).

A variety of factors can influence the amount of N2O produced through these agricultural
cropping practices, such as temperature, water content, soil pH, etc.
Another direct emissions source of N2O from agricultural soils comes from animal excretions
directly onto the land area (e.g. pasture, paddock, or range). This requires data on animal

population, mass and N emitted per unit of animal mass, as well as the amount of manure left on
the soil.
Emissions of N2O can also occur on an indirect basis from nitrogen applied to soils. These
emissions occur through the volatilization of ammonia and oxides of nitrogen, which can then be
re-deposited, enter the nitrification/denitrification cycle, and be emitted as N2O in another
location; or through leaching/runoff of N, which can enter the nitrification/denitrification cycle
on or off-site, and then be emitted as N2O. To calculate these emissions, the data used above on
nitrogen inputs from fertilizers and animals to crop soils are used again along with factors on the
fraction of nitrogen volatilized (10% for synthetic fertilizers and 20% for organic fertilizer
nitrogen), and an IPCC-based emission factor for N2O emissions from the re-deposited nitrogen
(0.01 kg N2O-N/kg N re-deposited).
Data on crop production in Kentucky from 1990 to 2006 from the USDA NASS were used to
calculate N2O emissions from crop residues and crops that fix nitrogen, as well as CH4 emissions
from agricultural residue burning. Emissions for the other agricultural crop production practices
categories (i.e., synthetic and organic fertilizers) were also calculated through 2006.
Data were not available to estimate nitrogen released by the cultivation of histosols (i.e., the
number of acres of high organic content soils). However, as discussed in the following section
for soil carbon, the Natural Resources Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University
estimated zero CO2 emissions for organic soils in Kentucky for 1997, suggesting that the area of
cultivated high organic content soils was either very small or zero in Kentucky. Therefore, N2O
emissions from cultivated histosol soils were also assumed to be zero.
Crop production – liming. Additions of lime for pH adjustment and urea fertilizer to soils
release carbon dioxide as these compounds are decomposed. Data on limestone and dolomite
application from 1990-2004 were available from the Land-Use Change and Forestry Module of
SIT. The SIT emission factor of 0.06 Mt C/Mt limestone/dolomite was used to estimate CO2
emissions. Limestone/dolomite application data are not specific to land use; however, CCS
assumed that the applications were all applied to agricultural soils. Data specific to urea
application were not readily available; hence, the emissions are not captured in this inventory.
The data in SIT are provided in terms of total commercial fertilizer N applied.
Crop production – rice cultivation. Methane emissions occur during rice cultivation as a result
of the anaerobic decomposition of organic materials in flooded fields. No rice cultivation occurs
in Kentucky.
Crop production – soil carbon. Net carbon fluxes from agricultural soils have been estimated
by researchers at the Natural Resources Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University, and
are reported in the U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks 73 and the U.S.
Agriculture and Forestry Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The estimates are based on the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology for soil carbon adapted to
conditions in the US. Preliminary state-level estimates of CO2 fluxes from mineral soils and
emissions from the cultivation of organic soils were reported in the U.S. Agriculture and

Forestry Greenhouse Gas Inventory. Currently, these are the best available data at the state-level
for this category. The inventory also reports national estimates of CO2 emissions from limestone
and dolomite application from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). 74 However, these
are now included above under the Agricultural soils – liming subsector.
Carbon dioxide fluxes resulting from specific management practices were reported. These
practices include: conversions of cropland resulting in either higher or lower soil carbon levels;
additions of manure; participation in the Federal Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); and
cultivation of organic soils (with high organic carbon levels). For Kentucky, Table F2 shows a
summary of the latest estimates available from the USDA, which are for 1997.75 These data
show that changes in agricultural practices are estimated to result in a net sink of 1.14
MMtCO2e/yr in Kentucky. Since data are not yet available from USDA to make a determination
of whether the emissions are increasing or decreasing, the net sink of 1.14 MMtCO2e/yr is
assumed to remain constant.
Note that emissions from agricultural soils estimated using the SIT were multiplied by a national
adjustment factor to reconcile differences between methodologies used in EPA’s National
Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the SIT. The national adjustment factor varies
substantially from year to year resulting in the introduction of noise into the agricultural soils
categories. The Agriculture, Forestry and Waste Technical Working Group should discuss
whether the National Adjustment Factor should be applied in the Kentucky Inventory and
Forecast.
Crop production – residue burning. Agricultural residue burning is conducted in Kentucky.
The default SIT method was used to calculate emissions along with NASS crop production data
through 2006. The SIT methodology calculates emissions by multiplying the amount (e.g.,
bushels or tons) of each crop produced by a series of factors to calculate the amount of crop
residue produced, the resultant dry matter, the carbon/nitrogen content of the dry matter, the
fraction of dry matter burned, the combustion efficiency, and emission factors for N2O and CH4.
Future work on this category should include an assessment to refine the SIT default assumptions.
Reference Case Projections
Future reference case emissions from both livestock and crop production were estimated based
on the annual growth rate in emissions [million metric ton (MMt) carbon dioxide equivalent
(CO2e) basis] for each source sector from 1990 to 2006. For livestock production, the default
data in SIT accounting for the percentage of each livestock category using each type of manure
management system was used for this inventory.

* Compound annual growth rates shown in this table were calculated using the growth rate in
historical emissions (MMtCO2e basis) from 1990 through the most recent year of data. These growth
rates were applied to forecast emissions from the latest year of inventory data to 2025.

The growth rates for enteric fermentation and manure management are driven by livestock
populations and manure management methods. From 1990 through 2006, dairy cattle
populations declined by about 45%. The growth rate for beef cattle during the 16-year period
from 1990 through 2006 was 5%. The swine population in Kentucky declined about 65% from
1990 through 2006. The growth rates shown in Table F1 are calculated using the trend in
emissions from 1990 through 2006 associated with the historical livestock populations and
default SIT assumptions on manure management systems used in Kentucky. Future work should
include an evaluation to improve the growth rates used for the reference case projections (e.g.
based on available studies of future agricultural activity in Kentucky). Such an evaluation should
also include an assessment to improve the growth rates for forecasting emissions associated with
the use of fertilizers containing nitrogen. Use of fertilizers that contain nitrogen in Kentucky
indicated a total growth rate of 12% between 1990 and 2006; however, fertilizer use peaked in
2004.
Results
As shown in Figure F1, gross GHG emissions from agricultural sources range between about
7.89 and 6.59 MMtCO2e from 1990 through 2030, respectively. See Table F2 for more
information on Kentucky gross GHG emissions. Enteric fermentation is the only major
emissions category growing in the forecast period in Kentucky, and accounted for about 48%
(3.25 MMtCO2e) of total agricultural emissions in 1990 and is estimated to account for about
58% (3.16 MMtCO2e) of total agricultural emissions in 2030. The manure management
category, accounted for 7.1% (0.48 MMtCO2e) of total agricultural emissions in 1990 and is
estimated to account for about 7.5% (0.41 MMtCO2e) of total agricultural emissions in 2030.

The agricultural soils category shows 1990 emissions accounting for 61% (4.15 MMtCO2e) of
total agricultural emissions and 2030 emissions estimated to be about 55% (3.00 MMtCO2e) of
total agricultural emissions. Because soil carbon is estimated to be a net sink of CO2 in
Kentucky, it is not included in the gross GHG emissions. See Table F3 for more information on
soil carbon estimates. Including the CO2 sequestration from soil carbon changes, the historic and
projected emissions for the agriculture sector on a net basis would range between about 6.75 and
5.45 MMtCO2e/yr from 1990 through 2030, respectively.

Notes: Ag Soils – Crops category includes: incorporation of crop residues and nitrogen fixing crops (no
cultivation of histosols estimated in Kentucky); emissions for agricultural residue burning are too small to be
seen in this chart. Soil carbon sequestration is not shown (see Table F2).

Agricultural burning emissions were estimated to be very small based on the SIT activity data
(<0.02 MMtCO2e/yr from 1990 to 2006). This agrees with the USDA Inventory, which also
reports a low level of residue burning emissions (0.02 MMtCO2e). 76
The only standard IPCC source categories missing from this report are N2O emissions from
cultivation of histosols.
Key Uncertainties
Emissions from enteric fermentation and manure management are dependent on the estimates of
animal populations and the various factors used to estimate emissions for each animal type and
manure management system (i.e., emission factors that are dependent on several variables,
including manure production levels, volatile solids contents of manures, and CH4 formation
potential). Each of these factors has some level of uncertainty. Also, animal populations fluctuate
throughout the year, and thus using point estimates introduces uncertainty into the average
annual estimates of these populations. In addition, there is uncertainty associated with the
original population survey methods employed by USDA. CCS believes that the largest
contributors to uncertainty in emissions from manure management are the emission factors,
which are derived from limited data sets.

As mentioned above, for emissions associated with changes in agricultural soil carbon levels, the
only data currently available are for 1997. When newer data are released by the USDA, these
should be reviewed to represent current conditions as well as to assess trends. In particular, given
the potential for some Conservation Reserve Program acreage to retire and possibly return to
active cultivation prior to 2030, the current size of the CO2 sink could be appreciably affected
(possibly even turning this net sink into a net source of CO2 in the future).
Another contributor to uncertainty in the emission estimates is the projection assumptions. This
inventory assumes that the average annual rate of change in future year emissions will follow the
historical average annual rate of change from 1990 through 2006. For example, the historical
data for 1990 through 2006 show an increase in the use of fertilizers. However, since 2004
fertilizer use has declined, which may be the start of a trend towards reduced fertilizer use. In
such a case, the predicted growth of 1990-2006 may be an overestimate.
Note that emissions from agricultural soils estimated using the SIT were multiplied by a national
adjustment factor to reconcile differences between methodologies used in EPA’s National
Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and the SIT. The Agriculture, Forestry and Waste
Technical Working Group should discuss whether the National Adjustment Factor is appropriate
for Kentucky’s Inventory and Forecast, or if agricultural soils emissions estimates should be
unadjusted.
Trees on agricultural lands are included in the forestry I&F through statistical plot sampling and
are grouped together with all other forest acres. Trees on agricultural lands are also included in
the National Woodland Owners survey of forests on private lands. However, since trees on
agricultural lands are grouped together with all other forest acres and not separated into their
own category, they have not been included in the agriculture I&F. It would be helpful in the
future to delineate the inventory of trees on agricultural lands since these would most likely be
managed differently than traditional forest lands.

Appendix G. Waste Management
Overview
GHG emissions from waste management include:
•

Solid waste management – methane (CH4) emissions from municipal and industrial solid
waste landfills (LFs), accounting for CH4 that is flared or captured for energy production
(this includes both open and closed landfills);

•

Solid waste combustion – CH4, carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions
from the combustion of solid waste in incinerators or waste to energy plants; and

•

Wastewater management – CH4 and N2O from municipal wastewater and CH4 from
industrial wastewater (WW) treatment facilities.

Inventory and Reference Case Projections
Municipal Solid Waste Historical and Projected Management Profile
The basis for the municipal solid waste (MSW) management profile was the 2009 Division of
Waste Management Annual Report.77 These data present the amount of MSW landfilled in
Kentucky, the amount of waste imported, the amount of waste exported, and the amount of waste
recycled for the years 1994 through 2008. The state data summaries provided the quantity of
waste composted and the amount of waste combusted at waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities. 78
Note that food waste composting data were not available. The composting totals represent yard
waste only.
MSW generation is defined as the sum of MSW landfill disposal, MSW combustion, and MSW
recovery. MSW combustion includes combustion at WTE facilities, combustion of commercial
and institutional waste without energy recovery, and open burning of residential waste. Recovery
includes recycling and composting.
The MSW generation totals presented in the KY DEP Waste Management Annual Report do not
include combustion. Therefore, the recycling percentages calculated in this appendix will not
match those from the KY DEP report. KY DEP states that the 2005 MSW recycling rate in
Kentucky was 23.4%, compared to the national 2005 MSW recycling rate of 30.0%. However,
the 2005 MSW recycling rate for Kentucky when combustion is included is 21.3%. 79
The amount of waste generated was back-cast for each year between 1990 and 1994 by applying
the calculated 1994 per-capita MSW generation rate (based on US Census Bureau population
data) to the population in Kentucky for 1990 through 1993. The MSW generation was forecast
through 2030 by applying a growth factor of 2.6% to the per-capita generation for each year
during the period 2009-2030. This growth factor is the average annual change in per-capita

generation over the period 1995-2008 (1994 was omitted from this calculation, as the per-capita
generation rate was very low and would have produced very large generation estimates for future
years). The amount of waste recycled, composted, landfilled, and combusted were estimated in
the back-cast and projected years by maintaining the ratios of waste managed through these
methods for the periods 1990-1993, and 2009-2030, respectively. A subset of the data and
projections are presented in Table G1.
Industrial waste is not explicitly included in the profile presented in Table G1. However, it is
likely that industrial waste is co-mingled with MSW at some of the waste disposal facilities in
Kentucky.

©CCS, June 2010

The process of estimating direct GHG emissions from the waste sector is detailed in the
following section of this appendix. These GHG emissions estimates utilize the landfill disposal
information in the above table in order to estimate methane emissions from landfills in
Kentucky. The direct GHG emissions estimates do not capture the embedded energy in landfilled
waste that could have been recycled. These materials represent a large potential for life-cycle
GHG reductions as a result of the emissions from raw materials extraction and new product
manufacturing that are avoided when waste is recycled, rather than landfilled. It is the experience
of CCS that approximately 10% of estimated GHG reductions from additional recycling efforts
are attributed to direct reductions in methane at landfills, while the remainder of the GHG
reductions are based on a reduction in life-cycle emissions. Composting also reduces life-cycle
GHG emissions from waste management, as the finished compost product may be applied to
crop fields, gardens, and landscape construction sites to increase soil carbon and moisture
retention, and reduce the need for fossil fuel-derived nitrogen fertilizers.
Solid Waste Management
MSW Landfills. For solid waste management, CCS used the US EPA State Inventory Tool
(SIT), 80 the historical and projected waste management profile detailed above, and the US EPA
Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) landfills database 81 as starting points to estimate
emissions. The LMOP data serve to identify which landfills currently utilize landfill gas to
energy (LFGTE) technology, and to estimate annual waste emplacement for each landfill.
A list of landfills in the state available at the KY DEP website was used to supplement the
LMOP database. 82 These additional data included information on one site that was not present in
the LMOP database (the Hopkins County Regional Landfill). The KY DEP website also contains
a county-by-county data report for 2007, which helped CCS estimate the amount of waste
disposed at each landfill in 2007. 83 Six of these sites collect landfill gas (LFG) for use in a
LFGTE combustion facility, with one more expecting to capture and utilize LFG by 2009. The
Outler Loop Bioreactor had a pipeline to GE Appliance Park installed in 1996; after that year its
emissions were assumed to be zero. 84 Eight other landfills have flaring equipment. 85 The rest of
the sites were assumed to be uncontrolled. KY DEP provided a list of 50 landfills that were
closed between 1992 and 1995. Waste emplacement data are not available for these landfills so
they were not included in the inventory. Consequently, the total historical emissions for this
sector reported in this inventory are an underestimate.
Annual waste emplacement was only available for 2004 through 2007. However, the data is very
disaggregated, and CCS did not have the resources to compile the data for 2004, 2005, and 2006.

CCS adjusted the landfill disposal totals from the 2007 County-by-County Data Report, so that
the total amount of waste landfilled was equal to the landfill disposal total from the 2007
Statewide Solid Waste Management Report. This adjustment was necessary because the countyby-county data does not include any imported waste. CCS used the adjusted 2007 disposal totals
and total waste-in-place data from the LMOP database to estimate annual emplacement at each
landfill. The 2007 waste emplaced was subtracted from the total waste emplaced, and the
remaining amount was divided by the number of years the landfill was open to estimate
historical annual emplacement.
Historical annual waste emplacement was entered into SIT for each landfill to estimate CH4
emissions. For the LFGTE and flared landfills, CCS assumed that the overall methane collection
and control efficiency is 75%. 86 Of the methane not captured by a landfill gas collection system,
it is further assumed that 10% is oxidized before being emitted to the atmosphere. Recent
literature corroborates the use of an oxidation rate, supporting a default oxidation rate of 10%. 87
For forecast years it was assumed that flaring equipment would be installed once a landfill
reached 1 million tons of waste emplaced. It was assumed that landfills that have crossed this
threshold but which do not yet have a flare would have one operational by 2011. It was assumed
that no new LFGTE would be installed during the policy period. 88 Future emissions were
estimated by assuming linear growth in the amount of waste landfilled (1.13%).
Composting. Not included in GHG I&F. Composting is a GHG mitigation strategy because it is
thought to produce fewer GHG emissions than landfill disposal, and provides a finished product
that can serve as a soil amendment that reduces the need for fossil fuel-based fertilizers and .
However, any composting operations in Kentucky are likely emitters of CH4 and N2O. The
Climate Action Reserve (CAR) is currently drafting a Composting Protocol that will provide
methods for quantifying GHG emissions from composting operations. However, at this time,
CCS has not quantified GHG emissions from composting operations.
Industrial Solid Waste Landfills. CCS used the EPA State Inventory Tool (SIT) default for
industrial solid waste landfills. This default is based on national data indicating that industrial
landfilled waste is emplaced at approximately 7 percent of the rate of MSW emplacement. We
assumed that this additional industrial waste emplacement occurs beyond that already addressed
in the emplacement rates for MSW sites described above. Due to a lack of data, no controls were
assumed for industrial waste landfilling.

Solid Waste Combustion
WTE Combustion. Waste-to-energy combustion emissions are not accounted for in this I&F
sector, as those emissions would be counted in the Electricity Supply I&F.
Incineration. There is no controlled combustion within the state.
Residential Open Burning. Open burning of MSW at residential sites (e.g. backyard burn
barrels) is illegal in Kentucky, however some open burning likely contributes to GHG emissions.
The US EPA’s 2002 National Emissions Inventory estimates the quantity of waste burned at
residential sites in Kentucky. 89 Emissions from open burning were calculated using SIT
emissions factors and waste characteristics for municipal waste combustion. Future emissions
were estimated using a 1% annual growth rate. Most illegal open burning investigated by the Air
Quality division is industrial, such as demolition debris and tires. 90 However, there is no data on
how much of this occurs so it was not included in the total.
Wastewater Management
Municipal WW Management. GHG emissions from municipal wastewater treatment were also
estimated. For municipal wastewater treatment, emissions are calculated in EPA’s SIT based on
state population, assumed biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and protein consumption per
capita, and emission factors for N2O and CH4. 91 The key SIT default values are shown in Table
G2 below. A revised value for the percentage of state residents not on septic (46%) was provided
by KY DEP. Municipal wastewater emissions were based on the growth rate for 1990-2007,
which was 0.97% per year.

Vegetables, Poultry, Pulp & Paper, and Bourbon were not available. 92
Results
Figure G1 and Table G3 show the emission estimates for the waste management sector. Overall,
the sector accounts for 2.09 MMtCO2e in 2005. By 2030, emissions are expected to grow slightly
to 2.10 MMtCO2e/yr. The largest contributor to waste management emissions is the solid waste
sector, in particular, solid waste landfills. In 2005, uncontrolled, flared, and LFGTE municipal
landfills accounted for 60% of total waste management emissions. By 2030, the contribution
from these sites is expected to be about 22%. Industrial landfills accounted for 8% and 14% of
the sector's emissions in 2005 and 2030, respectively. Waste combustion accounted for about 9%
of the waste sector emissions in 2005 and 10% in 2030.
In 2005, about 19% of the waste management sector emissions were contributed by municipal
wastewater treatment systems and 1% of emissions were contributed by industrial wastewater.
Note that these estimates are based on the default parameters listed in Table G1 above, and might
not adequately account for existing controls or management practices (e.g. anaerobic digesters
served by a flare or other combustion device). By 2030, the contribution to the total waste sector
emissions from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment sectors are expected to represent
24% and 1% of emissions, respectively.

Key Uncertainties
Data for closed landfills that are not covered by the LMOP database are not available. Therefore,
such landfills are not included in this analysis. The modeling only accounts for currently
uncontrolled sites that will need to apply controls during the period of analysis due to triggering
the requirements of the federal New Source Performance Standards/Emission Guidelines but
does not account for new landfills that will be uncontrolled. As noted above, the available data
do not cover all of the open and closed landfills in Kentucky, particularly the 50 closed in the
early 1990's. For this reason, emissions are underestimated for landfills.
Landfills are considered a sink for carbon, as some landfilled waste contains biogenic carbon that
is either perpetually trapped in the landfill, or is released at a much slower rate that it would be if
it were not landfilled. Currently, the estimated value for this sink is considered in the Forestry
I&F Appendix. The landfill carbon sink estimates in that appendix are based on population data
and default parameters, rather than the waste management profile described in this appendix.
For industrial landfills, emissions were estimated using national defaults (with industrial landfills
emitting 7% of MSW landfill emissions). It could be that the available MSW emplacement data
within the KY DEP data used to model the MSW emissions already captures some industrial LF
emplacement. As with overall MSW landfill emissions, industrial landfill emissions are
projected to increase between 2005 and 2030. Hence, the industrial landfill inventory and
forecast has a significant level of uncertainty and should be investigated further. For example,
the existence of active industrial landfills that are not already represented in the LMOP database
should be determined. If there are no separate sites just for industrial waste and the existing
municipal waste emplacement data are thought to include all industrial wastes, then the separate
estimate for industrial landfill emissions can be excluded from the inventory.
The State of Kentucky has no waste combustion facilities that are active, and open burning of
waste is illegal. Some open burning is known to occur, but there is significant uncertainty about
the quantity. Residential open burning was estimated based on national emissions inventory
methods and rural population estimates. Illegal burning of industrial waste such as demolition
debris and tires may occur in the state but there is no data currently available to estimate this so it
was not included in the inventory. Likewise the burning of storm debris was not included. Statelevel data of open burning surveys would improve this element of the I&F.

According to the SIT default assumption, zero wastewater biosolids are applied to soils. In this
inventory, N2O emissions associated with these biosolids would be included in the wastewater
sector. It is likely that some biosolids are applied to soils in Kentucky. Therefore, emissions from
this source are likely underestimated. The SIT Agriculture Module contains estimates of total
Activated Sewage Sludge soil application and the associated GHG emissions. Other key
uncertainties with the wastewater sector are associated with the application of SIT default values
for the parameters listed in Table G2 above (e.g. the fraction of BOD that is anaerobically
decomposed). The SIT defaults for emission factors used to estimate wastewater emissions were
derived from national data. Waste combustion emissions were also based on a factor derived
from national data.
Data on industrial wastewater were not available for most industries including: fruits and
vegetables, pulp and paper, poultry, and bourbon. Therefore these are not represented in this
inventory. Hence the estimate of emissions from industrial wastewater is likely an underestimate.
The addition of activity data from these industries would improve the I&F.

Appendix H. Forestry & Land Use
Overview
Forestland emissions refer to the net carbon dioxide (CO2) flux 93 from forested lands in
Kentucky, which account for about 50% of the state’s land area. 94 The dominant forest type in
Kentucky is oak-hickory which made up about 77% of forested lands in 1997. Other common
forest types are oak-pine at 7% of forested land, and maple-beech-birch at 6% of forested land.
Through photosynthesis, CO2 is taken up by trees and plants and converted to carbon in biomass
within the forests. Carbon dioxide emissions occur from respiration in live trees, decay of dead
biomass, and combustion (both wildfires and biomass removed from forests for energy use). In
addition, carbon is stored for long time periods when forest biomass is harvested for use in
durable wood products. Carbon dioxide flux is the net balance of CO2 removals from and
emissions to the atmosphere from the processes described above.
The forestry sector GHG emissions (including net CO2 flux) are categorized into two primary
subsectors:
•

Forested Landscape: this consists of carbon flux occurring on lands that are not part of the
urban landscape. Fluxes covered include net carbon sequestration, carbon stored in harvested
wood products (HWP) or landfills, and emissions from forest fires.

•

Urban Forestry and Land Use: this covers carbon sequestration in urban trees, flux
associated with carbon storage from landscape waste and food scraps in landfills, and nitrous
oxide (N2O) emissions from settlement soils (those occurring as a result of application of
synthetic fertilizers).

Inventory and Reference Case Projections
Forested Landscape
For over a decade, the United States Forest Service (USFS) has been developing and refining a
forest carbon modeling system for the purposes of estimating forest carbon inventories. The
methodology is used to develop national forest CO2 fluxes for the official US Inventory of
Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. The national estimates are compiled from state-level data.
The Kentucky forest CO2 flux data in this report come from the national analysis and are
provided by the USFS. See the footnotes below for the most current documentation for the forest
carbon modeling. 95 Additional forest carbon information is in the form of specific carbon
conversion factors. 96
93

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.
Total forested acreage is 12.7 million acres in 1997. Acreage by forest type available from the USFS at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/pubs/books/epa/states/KY.htm. The total land area in Kentucky is 25 million acres
(http://www.50states.com/kentucky.htm).

The forest CO2 flux methodology relies on input data in the form of plot-level forest volume
statistics from the Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA). FIA data on forest volumes are converted to
values for ecosystem carbon stocks (i.e., the amount of carbon stored in forest carbon pools)
using the FORCARB2 modeling system. Coefficients from FORCARB2 are applied to the plot
level survey data to give estimates of C density [megagrams (Mg) per hectare] for a number of
separate C pools. Additional background on the FORCARB system is provided in a number of
publications. 97
Carbon dioxide flux is estimated as the change in carbon mass for each carbon pool over a
specified time-frame. Forest biomass data from at least two points in time are required. The
change in carbon stocks between time intervals is estimated for specific carbon pools (Live Tree,
Standing Dead Wood, Understory, Down & Dead Wood, Forest Floor, and Soil Organic Carbon)
and divided by the number of years between inventory samples. Annual increases in carbon
density reflect carbon sequestration in a specific pool; decreases in carbon density reveal CO2
emissions or carbon transfers out of that pool (e.g., death of a standing tree transfers carbon from
the live tree to standing dead wood pool). The amount of carbon in each pool is also influenced
by changes in forest area (e.g., an increase in area could lead to an increase in the associated
forest carbon pools and the estimated flux). The sum of carbon stock changes for all forest
carbon pools yields a total net CO2 flux for forest ecosystems.
In preparing these estimates, USFS estimates the amount of forest carbon in different forest types
as well as separate carbon pools. The different forest types also include separate ownership
classes: those in the national forest (NF) system; and those that are not federally-owned (private
and other public forests). Additional details on the forest carbon inventory methods can be found
in Annex 3 to the US EPA’s 2007 GHG inventory for the US. 98
Annualized FIA data, as shown in Table H1, display a net decrease in forested area (6% between
1990 and 2005). Information on the number of forest surveys and the year these were conducted
was not accessible from the FIA database during the development of this appendix due to a
problem with the web site hosting the FIADB 2.1 component of the Carbon Calculation Tool. 99

Underlying data, including the years for which forest surveys were conducted, will be added in
subsequent revisions to this Appendix. Based on annualized data, forest land decreased linearly
from 1990 to 2005, which appears to have caused a reduction in carbon stocks in most carbon
pools. However, modeled gains in the live tree pools led to overall carbon stocks remaining
fairly level between 1990 and 2005 as shown in Table H1.

In addition to the forest carbon pools, additional carbon is stored in biomass removed from the
forest for the production of HWP. Carbon remains stored in the durable wood products pool or is
transferred to landfills where much of the carbon remains stored over a long period of time. The
USFS uses a model referred to as WOODCARB2 for the purposes of modeling national HWP
carbon storage. 100 Limited and somewhat dated state-level information for Kentucky was
provided to CCS by USFS. 101
As shown in Table H2, about 1.4 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2 per year (yr) is estimated by
the USFS to be sequestered annually (1990-2005) in wood products. Also shown in this table is
the total flux estimate including all forest pools of -2.3 MMtCO2e/yr. 102
Based on discussions with the USFS, CCS recommends excluding the soil carbon pool from the
overall forest flux estimates due to a high level of uncertainty associated with these estimates.

For historical emission estimates, CCS used the annualized carbon flux and carbon stock data for
the period 1990-2005 using the Carbon Calculation Tool. For the reference case projections
(2005-2030), the forest area and carbon densities of forestlands were assumed to remain at the
same levels as in 2005. Information is not available on the near term effects of climate change
and their impacts on forest productivity. Nor were data readily-available on projected losses in
forested area.
Urban Forestry & Land Use
GHG emissions from urban forestry and land use for 1990 through 2005 were estimated using
the US EPA State Inventory Tool (SIT) software and the methods provided in the Emission
Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP) guidance document for this sector. 103 In general, the SIT
methodology applies emission factors developed for the US to activity data for the urban forestry
sector. Activity data include urban area, urban area with tree cover, amount of landfilled yard
trimmings and food scraps, and the total amount of synthetic fertilizer applied to settlement soils
(e.g., parks, yards, etc.). This methodology is based on international guidelines developed by
sector experts for preparing GHG emissions inventories. 104 Table H3 displays the emissions and
reference case projections for Kentucky.
Changes in carbon stocks in urban trees are equivalent to tree growth minus biomass losses
resulting from pruning and mortality. Net carbon sequestration was calculated using data on
crown cover area. The default urban area data in SIT (which grew from 2,604 square kilometers

of urban area with tree cover (30% for Kentucky) to estimate the total area of urban tree cover.
These default SIT urban area tree cover data represent area estimates taken from the US Census
and coverage for years 1990 and 2000. 105 Estimates of urban area in the intervening years
(1990-1999) and subsequent years (2001-2005) are interpolated and extrapolated, respectively.

Estimates of net carbon flux of landfilled yard trimmings and food scraps were calculated by
estimating the change in landfill carbon stocks between inventory years. The SIT estimates for
the amount of landfilled yard trimmings decreased significantly during the 1990’s. CCS believes
that this is consistent with changes in the waste management industry during this period.
Therefore, the forecast was based on an extrapolation of the flux from 2000-2005, which show
relatively constant rates of landfilling these materials.
Settlement soils include all developed land, transportation infrastructure, and human settlements
of any size. Projections for urban trees and settlement soils were kept constant at 2005 levels.

Wildfire and Prescribed Burning Emissions
Biomass burned in forest fires emits CO2, methane (CH4), and N2O, in addition to many other
gases and pollutants. Since CO2 emissions are captured under total carbon flux calculations in
the USFS modeling described above, CCS used SIT to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions. CCS
used available state data from the State of Kentucky, Division of Forestry to estimate
emissions. 106 Acres burned were used for the years 1990-2008 and the forest type of “other
temperate forests” was assumed in SIT to calculate historical emissions. Note that these data

appear to be restricted to wildfires and not to include any prescribed burns.
Due to the yearly fluctuation of forest fire data, projected emissions for 2009-2030 were assumed
to be the average of 1990-2008 fire emissions. These emission estimates are presented in Table
H4, along with the total emissions from the forestry and land use sector.
Key Uncertainties
It is important to note that there were methodological differences in the FIA surveys in the preversus post-1999 time-frame. The FIA data form the basis of the USFS forest carbon pool
modeling and the different survey methods could produce varying estimates of forested area and
carbon density. For example, the FIA program modified the definition of forest cover for the
woodlands class of forestland (considered to be non-productive forests). Earlier FIA surveys
defined woodlands as having a tree cover of at least 10%, while the newer sampling methods
used a woodlands definition of tree cover of at least 5% (leading to more area being defined as
woodland). In woodland areas, the earlier FIA surveys might not have inventoried trees of
certain species or with certain tree form characteristics (leading to differences in both carbon
density and forested acreage). Given that the forested land in Kentucky is dominated by
timberlands (productive forests), CCS does not believe that the definitional differences noted
above have had a significant impact on the forest flux estimates provided in this report.
Also, FIA surveys since 1999 include all dead trees on the plots, but data prior to that are
variable in terms of these data. The modifications to FIA surveys are a result of an expanded
focus in the FIA program, which historically was only concerned with timber resources, while
more recent surveys have aimed at a more comprehensive gathering of forest biomass data. In
addition, the FIA program has moved from periodic to annual inventory methods – FIA now has
Kentucky on a continuous 5-year cycle. The effect of these changes in survey methods has not
been estimated by the USFS.
Regarding the forecast for the forested landscape, potentially the largest source of uncertainty
relates to the influence that future changes in climate will have on Kentucky’s forests to
sequester carbon. Regarding future land use change, FIA data indicate that forested acreage is
decreasing at the state-level. It is unclear whether these trends will continue.
Emissions from wildfires and prescribed burns were estimated. It appears that the available data
from the KY Division of Forestry covered wildfires, but not prescribed burns. To the extent that
prescribed burning is employed in the state, the emissions could represent an important data gap.
Much of the urban forestry and land use emission estimates rely on national default data and
could be improved with state-specific data (e.g. urban area under canopy cover).

Appendix I. Greenhouse Gases and Global Warming Potential Values:
Excerpts from the Inventory of US Greenhouse Emissions and Sinks:
1990-2000
Original Reference: Material for this Appendix is taken from the Inventory of US Greenhouse
Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990 - 2000, US Environmental Protection Agency, Office of
Atmospheric Programs, EPA 430-R-02-003, April 2002 www.epa.gov/globalwarming/
publications/emissions. Michael Gillenwater directed the preparation of this appendix.
Introduction
The Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks presents estimates by the United
States government of US anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals for the years
1990 through 2000. The estimates are presented on both a full molecular mass basis and on a
Global Warming Potential (GWP) weighted basis in order to show the relative contribution of
each gas to global average radiative forcing.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has recently updated the specific global
warming potentials for most greenhouse gases in their Third Assessment Report (TAR, IPCC
2001). Although the GWPs have been updated, estimates of emissions presented in the US
Inventory continue to use the GWPs from the Second Assessment Report (SAR). The guidelines
under which the Inventory is developed, the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National
Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC/UNEP/OECD/IEA 1997) and the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting guidelines for national
inventories 107 were developed prior to the publication of the TAR. Therefore, to comply with
international reporting standards under the UNFCCC, official emission estimates are reported by
the United States using SAR GWP values. This excerpt of the US Inventory addresses in detail
the differences between emission estimates using these two sets of GWPs. Overall, these
revisions to GWP values do not have a significant effect on US emission trends.
Additional discussion on emission trends for the United States can be found in the complete
Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2000.
What is Climate Change?
Climate change refers to long-term fluctuations in temperature, precipitation, wind, and other
elements of the Earth’s climate system. Natural processes such as solar-irradiance variations,
variations in the Earth’s orbital parameters, and volcanic activity can produce variations in
climate. The climate system can also be influenced by changes in the concentration of various
gases in the atmosphere, which affect the Earth’s absorption of radiation.
The Earth naturally absorbs and reflects incoming solar radiation and emits longer wavelength
terrestrial (thermal) radiation back into space. On average, the absorbed solar radiation is
balanced by the outgoing terrestrial radiation emitted to space. A portion of this terrestrial
radiation, though, is itself absorbed by gases in the atmosphere. The energy from this absorbed
terrestrial radiation warms the Earth's surface and atmosphere, creating what is known as the
107

“natural greenhouse effect.” Without the natural heat-trapping properties of these atmospheric
gases, the average surface temperature of the Earth would be about 33oC lower (IPCC 2001).
Under the UNFCCC, the definition of climate change is “a change of climate which is attributed
directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and
which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods.”
Given that definition, in its Second Assessment Report of the science of climate change, the
IPCC concluded that:
Human activities are changing the atmospheric concentrations and distributions of greenhouse gases
and aerosols. These changes can produce a radiative forcing by changing either the reflection or
absorption of solar radiation, or the emission and absorption of terrestrial radiation (IPCC 1996).

Building on that conclusion, the more recent IPCC Third Assessment Report asserts that
“[c]oncentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and their radiative forcing have continued to
increase as a result of human activities” (IPCC 2001).
The IPCC went on to report that the global average surface temperature of the Earth has
increased by between 0.6 ± 0.2°C over the 20th century (IPCC 2001). This value is about 0.15°C
larger than that estimated by the Second Assessment Report, which reported for the period up to
1994, “owing to the relatively high temperatures of the additional years (1995 to 2000) and
improved methods of processing the data” (IPCC 2001).
While the Second Assessment Report concluded, “the balance of evidence suggests that there is
a discernible human influence on global climate,” the Third Assessment Report states the
influence of human activities on climate in even starker terms. It concludes that, “[I]n light of
new evidence and taking into account the remaining uncertainties, most of the observed warming
over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations”
(IPCC 2001).
Greenhouse Gases
Although the Earth’s atmosphere consists mainly of oxygen and nitrogen, neither plays a
significant role in enhancing the greenhouse effect because both are essentially transparent to
terrestrial radiation. The greenhouse effect is primarily a function of the concentration of water
vapor, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases in the atmosphere that absorb the terrestrial radiation
leaving the surface of the Earth (IPCC 1996). Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of these
greenhouse gases can alter the balance of energy transfers between the atmosphere, space, land,
and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple measure
of changes in the energy available to the Earth-atmosphere system (IPCC 1996). Holding
everything else constant, increases in greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere will
produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth).
Climate change can be driven by changes in the atmospheric concentrations of a number of
radiatively active gases and aerosols. We have clear evidence that human activities have affected
concentrations, distributions and life cycles of these gases (IPCC 1996).
Naturally occurring greenhouse gases include water vapor, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane
(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ozone (O3). Several classes of halogenated substances that
contain fluorine, chlorine, or bromine are also greenhouse gases, but they are, for the most part,
solely a product of industrial activities. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are halocarbons that contain chlorine, while halocarbons that

contain bromine are referred to as bromofluorocarbons (i.e., halons). Because CFCs, HCFCs, and
halons are stratospheric ozone depleting substances, they are covered under the Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The UNFCCC defers to this earlier
international treaty; consequently these gases are not included in national greenhouse gas
inventories. Some other fluorine containing halogenated substances—hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—do not deplete stratospheric
ozone but are potent greenhouse gases. These latter substances are addressed by the UNFCCC
and accounted for in national greenhouse gas inventories.
There are also several gases that, although they do not have a commonly agreed upon direct
radiative forcing effect, do influence the global radiation budget. These tropospheric gases—
referred to as ambient air pollutants—include carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
sulfur dioxide (SO2), and tropospheric (ground level) ozone (O3). Tropospheric ozone is formed
by two precursor pollutants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in
the presence of ultraviolet light (sunlight). Aerosols—extremely small particles or liquid
droplets—often composed of sulfur compounds, carbonaceous combustion products, crustal
materials and other human induced pollutants—can affect the absorptive characteristics of the
atmosphere. However, the level of scientific understanding of aerosols is still very low (IPCC
2001).
Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide are continuously emitted to and removed from the
atmosphere by natural processes on Earth. Anthropogenic activities, however, can cause
additional quantities of these and other greenhouse gases to be emitted or sequestered, thereby
changing their global average atmospheric concentrations. Natural activities such as respiration
by plants or animals and seasonal cycles of plant growth and decay are examples of processes
that only cycle carbon or nitrogen between the atmosphere and organic biomass. Such
processes—except when directly or indirectly perturbed out of equilibrium by anthropogenic
activities—generally do not alter average atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations over
decadal timeframes. Climatic changes resulting from anthropogenic activities, however, could
have positive or negative feedback effects on these natural systems. Atmospheric concentrations
of these gases, along with their rates of growth and atmospheric lifetimes, are presented in Table
I1.

A brief description of each greenhouse gas, its sources, and its role in the atmosphere is given
below. The following section then explains the concept of Global Warming Potentials (GWPs),
which are assigned to individual gases as a measure of their relative average global radiative
forcing effect.
Water Vapor (H2O). Overall, the most abundant and dominant greenhouse gas in the
atmosphere is water vapor. Water vapor is neither long-lived nor well mixed in the atmosphere,
varying spatially from 0 to 2 percent (IPCC 1996). In addition, atmospheric water can exist in
several physical states including gaseous, liquid, and solid. Human activities are not believed to
directly affect the average global concentration of water vapor; however, the radiative forcing
produced by the increased concentrations of other greenhouse gases may indirectly affect the
hydrologic cycle. A warmer atmosphere has an increased water holding capacity; yet, increased
concentrations of water vapor affects the formation of clouds, which can both absorb and reflect
solar and terrestrial radiation. Aircraft contrails, which consist of water vapor and other aircraft
emittants, are similar to clouds in their radiative forcing effects (IPCC 1999).
Carbon Dioxide (CO2). In nature, carbon is cycled between various atmospheric, oceanic, land
biotic, marine biotic, and mineral reservoirs. The largest fluxes occur between the atmosphere
and terrestrial biota, and between the atmosphere and surface water of the oceans. In the
atmosphere, carbon predominantly exists in its oxidized form as CO2. Atmospheric carbon
dioxide is part of this global carbon cycle, and therefore its fate is a complex function of
geochemical and biological processes. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere
increased from approximately 280 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in pre-industrial times to
367 ppmv in 1999, a 31 percent increase (IPCC 2001). The IPCC notes that “[t]his concentration
has not been exceeded during the past 420,000 years, and likely not during the past 20 million
years. The rate of increase over the past century is unprecedented, at least during the past 20,000
years.” The IPCC definitively states that “the present atmospheric CO2 increase is caused by

anthropogenic emissions of CO2” (IPCC 2001). Forest clearing, other biomass burning, and
some non-energy production processes (e.g., cement production) also emit notable quantities of
carbon dioxide.
In its second assessment, the IPCC also stated that “[t]he increased amount of carbon dioxide [in
the atmosphere] is leading to climate change and will produce, on average, a global warming of
the Earth’s surface because of its enhanced greenhouse effect—although the magnitude and
significance of the effects are not fully resolved” (IPCC 1996).
Methane (CH4). Methane is primarily produced through anaerobic decomposition of organic
matter in biological systems. Agricultural processes such as wetland rice cultivation, enteric
fermentation in animals, and the decomposition of animal wastes emit CH4, as does the
decomposition of municipal solid wastes. Methane is also emitted during the production and
distribution of natural gas and petroleum, and is released as a by-product of coal mining and
incomplete fossil fuel combustion. Atmospheric concentrations of methane have increased by
about 150 percent since pre-industrial times, although the rate of increase has been declining.
The IPCC has estimated that slightly more than half of the current CH4 flux to the atmosphere is
anthropogenic, from human activities such as agriculture, fossil fuel use and waste disposal
(IPCC 2001).
Methane is removed from the atmosphere by reacting with the hydroxyl radical (OH) and is
ultimately converted to CO2. Minor removal processes also include reaction with Cl in the
marine boundary layer, a soil sink, and stratospheric reactions. Increasing emissions of methane
reduce the concentration of OH, a feedback which may increase methane’s atmospheric lifetime
(IPCC 2001).
Nitrous Oxide (N2O). Anthropogenic sources of N2O emissions include agricultural soils,
especially the use of synthetic and manure fertilizers; fossil fuel combustion, especially from
mobile combustion; adipic (nylon) and nitric acid production; wastewater treatment and waste
combustion; and biomass burning. The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has
increased by 16 percent since 1750, from a pre industrial value of about 270 ppb to 314 ppb in
1998, a concentration that has not been exceeded during the last thousand years. Nitrous oxide is
primarily removed from the atmosphere by the photolytic action of sunlight in the stratosphere.
Ozone (O3). Ozone is present in both the upper stratosphere, where it shields the Earth from
harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation, and at lower concentrations in the troposphere, where it is
the main component of anthropogenic photochemical “smog.” During the last two decades,
emissions of anthropogenic chlorine and bromine-containing halocarbons, such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), have depleted stratospheric ozone concentrations. This loss of
ozone in the stratosphere has resulted in negative radiative forcing, representing an indirect effect
of anthropogenic emissions of chlorine and bromine compounds (IPCC 1996). The depletion of
stratospheric ozone and its radiative forcing was expected to reach a maximum in about 2000
before starting to recover, with detection of such recovery not expected to occur much before
2010 (IPCC 2001).
The past increase in tropospheric ozone, which is also a greenhouse gas, is estimated to provide
the third largest increase in direct radiative forcing since the pre-industrial era, behind CO2 and
CH4. Tropospheric ozone is produced from complex chemical reactions of volatile organic
compounds mixing with nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. Ozone, carbon

monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter are included
in the category referred to as “criteria pollutants” in the United States under the Clean Air Act
and its subsequent amendments. The tropospheric concentrations of ozone and these other
pollutants are short-lived and, therefore, spatially variable.
Halocarbons, Perfluorocarbons, and Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6). Halocarbons are, for the
most part, man-made chemicals that have both direct and indirect radiative forcing effects.
Halocarbons that contain chlorine—chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons
(HCFCs), methyl chloroform, and carbon tetrachloride—and bromine—halons, methyl bromide,
and hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs)—result in stratospheric ozone depletion and are
therefore controlled under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.
Although CFCs and HCFCs include potent global warming gases, their net radiative forcing
effect on the atmosphere is reduced because they cause stratospheric ozone depletion, which is
itself an important greenhouse gas in addition to shielding the Earth from harmful levels of
ultraviolet radiation. Under the Montreal Protocol, the United States phased out the production
and importation of halons by 1994 and of CFCs by 1996. Under the Copenhagen Amendments to
the Protocol, a cap was placed on the production and importation of HCFCs by non-Article 5
countries beginning in 1996, and then followed by a complete phase-out by the year 2030. The
ozone depleting gases covered under the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments are not covered
by the UNFCCC.
Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are not
ozone depleting substances, and therefore are not covered under the Montreal Protocol. They are,
however, powerful greenhouse gases. HFCs—primarily used as replacements for ozone
depleting substances but also emitted as a by-product of the HCFC-22 manufacturing process—
currently have a small aggregate radiative forcing impact; however, it is anticipated that their
contribution to overall radiative forcing will increase (IPCC 2001). PFCs and SF6 are
predominantly emitted from various industrial processes including aluminum smelting,
semiconductor manufacturing, electric power transmission and distribution, and magnesium
casting. Currently, the radiative forcing impact of PFCs and SF6 is also small; however, they
have a significant growth rate, extremely long atmospheric lifetimes, and are strong absorbers of
infrared radiation, and therefore have the potential to influence climate far into the future (IPCC
2001).
Carbon Monoxide (CO). Carbon monoxide has an indirect radiative forcing effect by elevating
concentrations of CH4 and tropospheric ozone through chemical reactions with other
atmospheric constituents (e.g., the hydroxyl radical, OH) that would otherwise assist in
destroying CH4 and tropospheric ozone. Carbon monoxide is created when carbon-containing
fuels are burned incompletely. Through natural processes in the atmosphere, it is eventually
oxidized to CO2. Carbon monoxide concentrations are both short-lived in the atmosphere and
spatially variable.
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx). The primary climate change effects of nitrogen oxides (i.e., NO and
NO2) are indirect and result from their role in promoting the formation of ozone in the
troposphere and, to a lesser degree, lower stratosphere, where it has positive radiative forcing
effects. Additionally, NOx emissions from aircraft are also likely to decrease methane
concentrations, thus having a negative radiative forcing effect (IPCC 1999). Nitrogen oxides are
created from lightning, soil microbial activity, biomass burning – both natural and anthropogenic

fires – fuel combustion, and, in the stratosphere, from the photo-degradation of nitrous oxide
(N2O). Concentrations of NOx are both relatively short-lived in the atmosphere and spatially
variable.
Nonmethane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOCs). Nonmethane volatile organic
compounds include compounds such as propane, butane, and ethane. These compounds
participate, along with NOx, in the formation of tropospheric ozone and other photochemical
oxidants. NMVOCs are emitted primarily from transportation and industrial processes, as well as
biomass burning and non-industrial consumption of organic solvents. Concentrations of
NMVOCs tend to be both short-lived in the atmosphere and spatially variable.
Aerosols. Aerosols are extremely small particles or liquid droplets found in the atmosphere.
They can be produced by natural events such as dust storms and volcanic activity, or by
anthropogenic processes such as fuel combustion and biomass burning. They affect radiative
forcing in both direct and indirect ways: directly by scattering and absorbing solar and thermal
infrared radiation; and indirectly by increasing droplet counts that modify the formation,
precipitation efficiency, and radiative properties of clouds. Aerosols are removed from the
atmosphere relatively rapidly by precipitation. Because aerosols generally have short
atmospheric lifetimes, and have concentrations and compositions that vary regionally, spatially,
and temporally, their contributions to radiative forcing are difficult to quantify (IPCC 2001).
The indirect radiative forcing from aerosols is typically divided into two effects. The first effect
involves decreased droplet size and increased droplet concentration resulting from an increase in
airborne aerosols. The second effect involves an increase in the water content and lifetime of
clouds due to the effect of reduced droplet size on precipitation efficiency (IPCC 2001). Recent
research has placed a greater focus on the second indirect radiative forcing effect of aerosols.
Various categories of aerosols exist, including naturally produced aerosols such as soil dust, sea
salt, biogenic aerosols, sulphates, and volcanic aerosols, and anthropogenically manufactured
aerosols such as industrial dust and carbonaceous aerosols (e.g., black carbon, organic carbon)
from transportation, coal combustion, cement manufacturing, waste incineration, and biomass
burning.
The net effect of aerosols is believed to produce a negative radiative forcing effect (i.e., net
cooling effect on the climate), although because they are short-lived in the atmosphere—lasting
days to weeks—their concentrations respond rapidly to changes in emissions. Locally, the
negative radiative forcing effects of aerosols can offset the positive forcing of greenhouse gases
(IPCC 1996). “However, the aerosol effects do not cancel the global-scale effects of the much
longer-lived greenhouse gases, and significant climate changes can still result” (IPCC 1996).
The IPCC’s Third Assessment Report notes that “the indirect radiative effect of aerosols is now
understood to also encompass effects on ice and mixed-phase clouds, but the magnitude of any
such indirect effect is not known, although it is likely to be positive” (IPCC 2001). Additionally,
current research suggests that another constituent of aerosols, elemental carbon, may have a
positive radiative forcing (Jacobson 2001). The primary anthropogenic emission sources of
elemental carbon include diesel exhaust, coal combustion, and biomass burning.

Global Warming Potentials
Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) are intended as a quantified measure of the globally
averaged relative radiative forcing impacts of a particular greenhouse gas. It is defined as the
cumulative radiative forcingboth direct and indirect effectsintegrated over a period of time
from the emission of a unit mass of gas relative to some reference gas (IPCC 1996). Carbon
dioxide (CO2) was chosen as this reference gas. Direct effects occur when the gas itself is a
greenhouse gas. Indirect radiative forcing occurs when chemical transformations involving the
original gas produce a gas or gases that are greenhouse gases, or when a gas influences other
radiatively important processes such as the atmospheric lifetimes of other gases. The relationship
between gigagrams (Gg) of a gas and Tg CO2 Eq. can be expressed as follows:
 Tg 
 where,
Tg CO 2 Eq = (Gg of gas ) × (GWP ) × 
 1,000 Gg 
Tg CO2 Eq. = Teragrams of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents
Gg = Gigagrams (equivalent to a thousand metric tons)

GWP = Global Warming Potential
Tg = Teragrams

GWP values allow policy makers to compare the impacts of emissions and reductions of
different gases. According to the IPCC, GWPs typically have an uncertainty of roughly ±35
percent, though some GWPs have larger uncertainty than others, especially those in which
lifetimes have not yet been ascertained. In the following decision, the parties to the UNFCCC
have agreed to use consistent GWPs from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR), based
upon a 100 year time horizon, although other time horizon values are available (see Table I2).
In addition to communicating emissions in units of mass, Parties may choose also to use
global warming potentials (GWPs) to reflect their inventories and projections in carbon
dioxide-equivalent terms, using information provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) in its Second Assessment Report. Any use of GWPs should be based
on the effects of the greenhouse gases over a 100-year time horizon. In addition, Parties may
also use other time horizons. (FCCC/CP/1996/15/Add.1)
Greenhouse gases with relatively long atmospheric lifetimes (e.g., CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs,
and SF6) tend to be evenly distributed throughout the atmosphere, and consequently global
average concentrations can be determined. The short-lived gases such as water vapor, carbon
monoxide, tropospheric ozone, other ambient air pollutants (e.g., NOx, and NMVOCs), and
tropospheric aerosols (e.g., SO2 products and black carbon), however, vary spatially, and
consequently it is difficult to quantify their global radiative forcing impacts. GWP values are
generally not attributed to these gases that are short-lived and spatially inhomogeneous in the
atmosphere.

* Because these compounds have been shown to deplete stratospheric ozone, they are typically referred to as ozone
depleting substances (ODSs). However, they are also potent greenhouse gases. Recognizing the harmful effects of
these compounds on the ozone layer, in 1987 many governments signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances that
Deplete the Ozone Layer to limit the production and importation of a number of CFCs and other halogenated
compounds. The United States furthered its commitment to phase-out ODSs by signing and ratifying the Copenhagen
Amendments to the Montreal Protocol in 1992. Under these amendments, the United States committed to ending the
production and importation of halons by 1994, and CFCs by 1996. The IPCC Guidelines and the UNFCCC do not
include reporting instructions for estimating emissions of ODSs because their use is being phased-out under the
Montreal Protocol. The effects of these compounds on radiative forcing are not addressed here.

The IPCC recently published its Third Assessment Report (TAR), providing the most current and
comprehensive scientific assessment of climate change (IPCC 2001). Within that report, the
GWPs of several gases were revised relative to the IPCC’s Second Assessment Report (SAR)
(IPCC 1996), and new GWPs have been calculated for an expanded set of gases. Since the SAR,
the IPCC has applied an improved calculation of CO2 radiative forcing and an improved CO2
response function (presented in WMO 1999). The GWPs are drawn from WMO (1999) and the
SAR, with updates for those cases where new laboratory or radiative transfer results have been
published. Additionally, the atmospheric lifetimes of some gases have been recalculated.
Because the revised radiative forcing of CO2 is about 12 percent lower than that in the SAR, the
GWPs of the other gases relative to CO2 tend to be larger, taking into account revisions in
lifetimes. However, there were some instances in which other variables, such as the radiative
efficiency or the chemical lifetime, were altered that resulted in further increases or decreases in
particular GWP values. In addition, the values for radiative forcing and lifetimes have been
calculated for a variety of halocarbons, which were not presented in the SAR. The changes are
described in the TAR as follows:
New categories of gases include fluorinated organic molecules, many of which are ethers that
are proposed as halocarbon substitutes. Some of the GWPs have larger uncertainties than that of
others, particularly for those gases where detailed laboratory data on lifetimes are not yet
available. The direct GWPs have been calculated relative to CO2 using an improved calculation
of the CO2 radiative forcing, the SAR response function for a CO2 pulse, and new values for the
radiative

Appendix D
Methods for Quantification
Attached to this appendix is the Memo from the Center for Climate Strategies that sets forth the
methods used in quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions and direct costs/cost
savings associated with the policy recommendations. The memo also provides examples of the
distinction between “direct” and “indirect” costs. In addition, the combined impacts of all of the
policy recommendations within and between each sector were estimated as if all of the
recommendations were implemented together. This involves eliminating any overlaps in
coverage of affected entities that would occur to avoid double counting of impacts. This
memorandum was submitted to the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council on August 4, 2010
and subsequently adopted via an e-mail approval process. In addition to this general
Quantification Assumptions Memo (QAM) each of the four TWGs had sector-specific QAMs
prepared and approved by the KCACP and these can be found on the KCACP web site in the
Post-Meeting #7 materials.

Memo
To:

Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council

From:

The Center for Climate Strategies

Subject:

Quantification of Climate Mitigation Policy Options

Date:

August 4, 2010

This memo summarizes key elements of the recommended methodology for estimating GHG
impacts and cost effectiveness for draft policy options for analysis considered amenable to
quantification. The quantification process is intended to support custom design and analysis of
draft policy options, and provide both consistency and flexibility. Feedback is encouraged.
Key guidelines include:
•

Focus of analysis: Net GHG reduction potential in physical units of million metric tons
(MMt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and net cost per metric ton reduced in units of
dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent ($/tCO2e). Where possible, full life cycle
analysis is used to evaluate the net energy (and emissions) performance of actions (taking
into account all energy inputs and outputs to production). Net analysis of the effects of
carbon sequestration is conducted where applicable.

•

Cost-effectiveness: Because monetized dollar value of GHG reduction benefits are not
available, physical benefits are used instead, measured as dollars per metric ton of carbon
dioxide equivalent ($/tCO2e) (cost or savings per ton) or “cost effectiveness” evaluation.
Both positive costs and cost savings (negative costs) are estimated as a part of compliance
cost.

•

Geographic inclusion: Measure GHG impacts of activities that occur within the state,
regardless of the actual location of emissions reductions. For instance, a major benefit of
recycling is the reduction in material extraction and processing (e.g. aluminum production).
While a policy option may increase recycling in Kentucky, the reduction in emissions may
occur where this material is produced. Where significant emissions impacts are likely to
occur outside the state, this will be clearly indicated. These emissions reductions are counted
towards the achievement of the state’s emission goal, since they result from actions taken by
the state.

•

Direct vs. indirect effects: “Direct effects” are those borne by the entities implementing the
policy recommendation. For example, direct costs are net of any financial benefits or savings
to the entity. “Indirect effects” are defined as those borne by the entities other than those
implementing the policy recommendation. Indirect effects will be quantified on a case-bycase basis depending on magnitude, importance, time available, need and availability of data.
(See additional discussion and list of examples below.)

•

Non-GHG (external) impacts and costs: Include in qualitative terms where deemed
important. Quantify on a case-by-case basis as needed depending on need and where data are
readily available.

•

Discounting and annualizing: Discount a multi-year stream of net costs (or savings) to arrive
at the “net present value cost” of the cost of implementing a policy option. Discount costs in
constant 2005 dollars using a 5% annual real discount rate for the project period of 2010
through 2030 (unless otherwise specified for the particular policy option). Capital
investments are represented in terms of annualized or amortized costs through 2030. Create
an annualized cost per ton by dividing the present value cost or cost savings by the
cumulative reduction in tons of GHG emissions.

•

Time period of analysis: Count the impacts of actions that occur during the project time
period and, using annualized emissions reduction and cost analysis, report emissions
reductions and costs for specific target years of 2020 and 2030. Where additional GHG
reductions or costs occur beyond the project period as a direct result of actions taken during
the project period, show these for comparison and potential inclusion.

•

Aggregation of cumulative impacts of policy options: In addition to “stand alone” results for
individual options, estimate cumulative impacts of all options combined. In this process we
avoid simple double counting of GHG reduction potential and cost when adding emission
reductions and costs associated with all of the policy recommendations. To do so we note and
or estimate interactive effects between policy recommendations using analytical methods
where significant overlap or equilibrium effects are likely.

•

Policy design specifications and other key assumptions: Include explicit notation of timing,
goal levels, implementing parties, the type of implementation mechanism, and other key
assumptions as determined by the Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC).

•

Transparency: Include policy design choices (above) as well as data sources, methods, key
assumptions, and key uncertainties. Use data and comments provided by KCAPC to ensure
best available data sources, methods, and key assumptions using their expertise and
knowledge to address specific issues in Kentucky. Modifications will be made through
facilitated decisions.

Board of the US EPA available at:

The benefits of increased forest carbon sequestration will last far beyond the policy period. When GHG reductions
and cost-effectiveness are calculated considering the lifetime of the forest (~50 years), the results are 3.3 MMtCO2e
and 5.3 $/tCO2e, respectively.
2
This policy overlaps with policies in the ES sector; the overlapping benefits and costs were removed in the overall
KCAPC process results shown for total benefits and costs in the final report.

E-1

$/tCO2e = dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent; ES = Energy Supply; GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e
= million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; MSW = municipal solid waste; NT/CT = no till/conservation tillage;
RCI = Residential, Commercial, and Industrial; TLU = Transportation and Land Use.
Negative values in the Net Present Value and the Cost-Effectiveness columns represent net cost savings. Negative
NPV represents positive net cash flows from the policy recommendation (i.e., the costs of the policy recommendation,
when levelized over their expected lifetimes, are less than expected expenditures).Policy recommendations with
estimated costs savings still are likely to require significant up-front capital investments.
The numbering used to denote the above policy recommendations is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect
prioritization among these important policy recommendations.
Totals do not equal sum of individual policy recommendations due to subtraction of overlaps.

Table AFW-1 shows the potential biomass resources available in Kentucky. These volumes are
expected to be available by 2025; however, the total amounts would require changes in land use,
not all of which have been included in the policy recommendations described in this document.
Total biomass availability by year is shown in Table AFW-2. Note that the TWG did not consider
other potential feedstock sources such as, municipal solid waste (except urban wood waste),
including paper, cardboard, food/yard waste, or other organic materials.

Table AFW-2 shows biomass supply and demand for Kentucky. The total available biomass
matches that shown in Table AFW-1, although this achievable biomass figure is not reached until
2025. As can be seen in Table AFW-2, there is sufficient biomass for all years to meet the needs
of the three energy supply recommendations, as well as the advanced biofuel recommendation.
The biomass demand split shown in Table AFW-2 is driven primarily by the amount of biomass
needed for cellulosic ethanol production to ensure that the demand requirements of Transportation
and Land Use (TLU) policy recommendation TLU-10 are met with in-state production. Future
market conditions, including the cost of biomass and fossil fuels, will drive the relative
penetration of biofuel use within each sector. Continued study and refinement of this initial

This may include unharvested trees that are increasing in size on property for which there is no plan to harvest, or

Table AFW-2 shows there is sufficient biomass in KY to meet the demands of ES-1, ES-5, ES-7 and AFW-4 for all
years except for 2021 and 2022. Any shortage would affect ES-5 first, and given the very small shortages indicated,
only ES-5. Given that biomass availability has been conservatively estimated and ES-5 biomass demand may not be
as high as shown in this table, this analysis assumes sufficient biomass is available to meet all biomass needs even in
the two constrained years.

AFW-1. Forestry Management for Carbon Sequestration

Policy Description
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured and stored in trees, soil, and other forest biomass. Forest
management activities that promote forest production have the potential to increase net CO2
sequestration rates and enhance greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits. Retaining forest management
where it is currently practiced and expanding the area covered by management plans would
stimulate the rate of production, in terms of both forest growth and the amount of biomass
harvested. A managed forest is a healthier and more productive one. The healthier a forest, the
better the trees grow, and the better the trees grow, the more carbon they sequester.
From the history of Kentucky’s forests, we can see that there is no single statement regarding the
value of Kentucky’s forests. Value, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Attitudes toward
Kentucky’s forests have changed, diversified, and shifted throughout Kentucky’s history, and
will continue to do so as the concerns of our culture, the status of the resource, and the desired
end uses fluctuate in the future.
Economic incentives are often the easiest way to promote new ideas. Due to the financial
significance of forest-related products, Kentucky stands to benefit greatly from sustainable
management. Traditionally, wood products have stimulated forest management, and practices
such as agro-forestry provide alternative ways to produce revenue on forestland. Currently, many
policies are being discussed and developed nationally with regard to carbon sequestration and
biofuels for energy.
Policy Design
Goals: Increase net carbon sequestration in Kentucky’s forests by completing forest management
plans on one million acres of currently forested lands by 2025.
Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Kentucky Division of Forestry, Kentucky Woodland Owners Association, U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA) United States Forest Service (USFS), USDA Farm Services
Agency, Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, University of Kentucky,
nongovernment organizations, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Promote carbon-marketing opportunities to increase interest in forest management.
o Carbon sequestration represents a potential avenue to assist with afforestation and
reforestation programs. Currently, the Climate Action Reserve is the most advanced
program for forestry projects in the United States.

E-5

o Promote opportunities for landowners and businesses to participate in the various
certification systems.
•

Expand state financial support for cost-share programs.

•

Develop information related to improving carbon sequestration in a manner that improves
forest health and productivity, while sustaining biodiversity and other natural resource
benefits.

•

Look for opportunities and provide necessary resources to improve forest health and
productivity on state-owned forests.

•

Offer new initiatives that provide landowners incentives to improve forest resources,
encourage proper management, promote sustainability of forestlands, and benefit the forest
products industry. Practices may include:
o increased stocking of poorly stocked lands,
o thinning and density management,
o fertilization and waste recycling,
o expanded short-rotation woody crops (for fiber and energy),
o expanded use of genetically preferred species,
o modified biomass removal practices,
o fire management and risk reduction,
o pest and disease management, and
o promoting biodiversity of forests to improve ecosystem services and sustainability.

•

Prepare educational materials to inform forest landowners about certification systems and
carbon market opportunities.

•

Increase the percentage of forest management plans that are actively renewed.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

The Kentucky Division of Forestry's Forest Stewardship Program and Landowner Services
provides forest landowners support on improving forest management.

•

The Kentucky Division of Forestry's forest health program focuses on identifying and
monitoring for potential insect, disease, and invasive, and exotic plant problems that threaten
our forestlands.

•

The Kentucky Forest Conservation Act regulates all commercial loggers and requires the
use of best management practices to help protect water quality.

•

The Kentucky Master Logger Program is an education program that teaches logging methods
that benefit both industry and the forest.

•

The Mountain Association for Community Economic Development (MACED) promotes
sustainable forest management and seeks to compensate forest owners for increased carbon
sequestration through carbon offsets.

Quantification Methods
GHG Reductions
This policy seeks to improve carbon sequestration in Kentucky forests by implementing forest
management plans on 1,000,000 acres by 2025. Forest management plans increase the health and
often the productivity of the forest. Depending on landowners’ goals, forest management plans
may be focused on increased harvesting productivity, wildlife management, hunting (such as deer
leases), aesthetic value, or other objectives.
Table AFW-1-2 summarizes the number of acres enrolled annually in a forest management
program, the cumulative acres treated throughout the policy period, the increased carbon
sequestration, and the costs of completing forest management plans.
Kentucky forests currently sequester 3.3 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(tCO2e/acre/year), which is roughly the equivalent of one 18-inch oak tree per acre per year. 15
This amounts to approximately 2.8% growth per year.

BAU = business as usual; CO2e = carbon dioxide equivalent; GHG = greenhouse gas.

It was assumed that a change in forest management would increase forest carbon sequestration by
2% above the baseline sequestration rate. 16 This is consistent with carbon sequestration rates
published for average- and high-productivity Loblolly and shortleaf pine stands in the southeastern
United States, which show a 5% gain in carbon sequestration in the high-productivity stands. GHG
savings were estimated by multiplying total acreage under forest management plans by 0.066 metric
tons CO2e/acre/year (3.3 metric tons CO2e/acre/year times 2.8%).
Some percentage of forests under management will continue to be harvested. Harvested wood
products may be used for durable wood products and will continue to sequester carbon even after
16

There is significant uncertainty regarding this number. It is assumed that the carbon sequestration improvement
would be above zero, but it is unknown what exactly it would be. Most academic and research reports focus on the
upper limit of carbon sequestration under ideal forest management scenarios, rather than techniques that could be
implemented on a statewide basis. There is a paucity of literature on carbon sequestration effects of forest
management plans for the average landowner.

being removed from the forest. This analysis, however, does not attempt to estimate disposition of
harvested wood products from managed forests.
Cost Analysis
The cost of preparing a forest management plan is estimated to be $24 per acre. 17 It is assumed
that this cost is incurred in the first year. For most forest owners in Kentucky, there will be other
costs incurred to implement the forest management plan, such as timber stand improvement,
clearing, and treatment. These are not estimated at this time due to a lack of specific data.
Additional revenue may be realized by forest landowners who register for carbon offsets. This
would decrease the overall cost of the policy. However, this revenue stream has not been included
in this analysis due to a lack of data. Landowners who enroll in a carbon credit program would
need to perform both a baseline inventory and a 10-year inventory to estimate sequestration.
These costs are also not included in this analysis at this time due to lack of data.
Long-Term Effects
Benefits from improved forest carbon sequestration will be realized long after the end of the policy
period considered in this analysis (2030). Improved forest management techniques are expected to
provide long-term benefits to acres under management. To illustrate the potential long-term impact
of forest improvement, it is assumed that increased carbon sequestration in managed forests
persists for the life cycle of a forest stand—at least 50 years. Consequently, acres that are enrolled
in a forest management program in 2011 will continue to have benefits through 2061. Additional
benefits would be realized, even if no additional costs are expended. Long-term GHG savings and
cost=effectiveness are summarized in Table AFW-1-3. If long-term benefits are included, GHG
reductions would be 3.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) rather than
the 0.86 MMtCO2e realized during the policy period of 2011–2030.

Key Assumptions
•

Acres are enrolled linearly over the policy period. Kentucky forests sequester 3.3

•

Forest management would increase forest carbon sequestration by 2%.

•

The cost of preparing a forest management plan is estimated to be $24 per acre.

Scott Shouse, MACED, personal communication to R. Anderson, CCS, via email, December 2010. It would take a
forester approximately a day and a half to walk the property, interview the landowner, and write the plan for a 30-100
acre property. At $480 a day, that comes out to $720. Average land ownership in Kentucky is 30 acres. The per-acre
cost for a 30-acre plot is $24.

E-9

Key Uncertainties
•

There is significant uncertainty regarding the improved forest carbon sequestration of 2%.

•

The analysis does not include quantification or disposition of harvested wood products.

•

The costs currently only include creation of forest management plans, not other tasks or
techniques that would be required to implement the plans. At the time of printing of this
report, there is insufficient data to determine the various remedies that would be required in
the state’s privately owned forests; therefore, the costs of the remedies are not included in the
quantification. Inclusion of these costs would increase the total cost of this policy.

•

The costs do not include enrollment in carbon offset programs or carbon credit revenue
streams. At the time of printing of this report, there is insufficient data available to include
this revenue stream in the evaluation. Inclusion of carbon credit revenue would reduce the
cost of this policy recommendation.

•

Additionally, weather and natural disasters, such as wildfire, ice storms, tornados, etc., can
have deleterious effects on forest health and could affect the implementation of forest
management plans.

Additional Benefits and Costs
•

Forests with management plans often include side benefits of improved wildlife habitats,
water quality, soil quality, and aesthetic value.

•

Enrollment in carbon credit programs would provide additional revenue streams for
landowners and may result in increased active renewal of plans.

Feasibility Issues
It is unclear if there are an adequate number of forestry professionals available to prepare forest
management plans and assist landowners in the implementation of those plans.

AFW-2. Expanded Use of Biomass Feedstocks for
Electricity, Heat, and Steam Production

Policy Description
This policy dedicates a sustainable quantity of biomass for efficient conversion to energy and
economical production of heat, steam, and electricity. Biomass sources may include agricultural
residues (crop residues, wasteland grass and weeds, animal bedding, etc.); wood industry residues
(slabs, sawdust, trimmings, etc.); urban waste; and managed agriculture crops (wood from
woodlands, switchgrass, etc.) grown for profit from the biomass industry. Other sources may be
residues from land restoration activity and land clearing for roads and strip mines.
Biomass should be used in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner. Proper facility
siting and feedstock use should be considered (e.g., proximity of users to biomass, impacts on
water supply and quality, control of air emissions, solid waste management, cropping
management, nutrient management, soil and nonsoil carbon management, and impacts on
biodiversity and wildlife habitat). The objective is to reduce GHG emissions through
displacement of fossil fuels, considering life-cycle GHG emissions associated with viable
production, collection, hauling, and energy conversion and distribution systems.
Policy Design
Goals: Supply biomass sufficient to displace meet ES TWG goals for biomass power production
by 2030.
This policy will focus on the production and delivery of biomass for electricity, heat, and steam.
GHG reductions and costs from utilizing the biomass as fuel will be considered under the Energy
Supply (ES) policy recommendations ES-1, ES-5, and ES-7.
Timing: Linear implementation through 2030.
Parties Involved
•

Parties involved in the production and transportation of biomass feedstocks, including
farmers, landowners, local businesses, land planners, rural agencies, local units of
government, state and local environmental agencies, renewable energy developers and
providers, community action agencies, forest product industries with waste products,
conservation groups, the Kentucky Division of Forestry, Kentucky’s Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS), and state universities.

•

Parties involved with utilization of the biomass as fuel will be included under ES-1, ES-5, and
ES-7.

Other
•

Excess biomass may be exported from the state, or used for liquid biofuel production, if ES
policies are not able to use the biomass supply outlined herein.

E-11

•

Biomass products would be processed into a product that can be used for co-firing in electrical
and heating boilers throughout the state.

Implementation Mechanisms
•

Utilize energy crops, agriculture residues, forestry and wood industry residues to achieve the
goal.

•

Promote biomass harvested from marginal production acres without necessarily reducing food
production.

•

Ensure best management practices for extraction are followed.

•

Use funds from the Kentucky Agricultural Development Fund, NRCS Environmental Quality
Incentives Program (EQIP), and state cost sharing through NRCS.

•

Establish biomass production with the support and development guidelines of NRCS.
Encourage organic fertilizer (manure) for biomass production.

•

Provide venues/opportunities to coordinate biomass suppliers with biomass end users.

•

Note: Do not plant crops (invasives) that will have a negative impact on Kentucky species.
Encourage use of plants that are native or noninvasive, or have passed testing protocols for
invasiveness and overall environmental impact. Avoid species that excessively deplete soil or
water resources—i.e., plants that are more of a drain on the environment than the energy they
produce.

•

Harvest all biomass products sustainably without depriving soils of important organic
components for reducing erosion. Maintain soil nutrients and structure, and do not deplete
wildlife habitat or jeopardize future feedstocks in quantity or quality.

•

Evaluate the life-cycle energy costs and carbon emissions for each feedstock.

•

Locate the preparation facilities in feasible areas to decrease transportation costs, and decrease
GHG emissions from the transportation source, for both the raw products and the location at
which the product would be used.

•

Install manure digesters and energy recovery projects in hog, dairy, and poultry operations.

•

Use community and multi-facility digesters, as they are far more cost-efficient than units on
individual operations.

Quantification Methods
•

The benefits of this recommendation are dependent on developing in-state production capacity
that achieves GHG benefits beyond petroleum fuels.

•

The use of biomass for electricity generation is being considered within the ES
recommendations.. To avoid double counting, this AFW analysis will only consider the
production costs and potential quantities of biomass for Kentucky. The distribution costs and
GHG savings will be accounted for in the ES Technical Work Group (TWG) analysis.

Biomass Availability and Costs
Table AFW-1 of this appendix summarizes biomass availability in Kentucky. It is assumed that
various types of biomass supply will be utilized in proportion to their current availability,
although this may not be the case, since feedstocks are geographically sensitive, and future
feedstock supplies may differ in proportionate makeup from current supplies.
The costs and availability of these biomass feedstocks come from the biomass supply estimate.
Costs were divided into five categories: agricultural residues, agricultural energy crops, woody
energy crops, woody residues, and waste feedstocks. The costs used in this analysis are shown in
Table AFW-2-1, and are discussed in greater detail earlier in Table AFW-1.

The total discounted cost of supplying the biomass needed to meet the AFW-2 goal is $6.3
billion. Note that this cost does not account for the benefit of replacing the fossil fuel feedstock.
Those costs will be accounted for in ES-1. Additionally, this cost does not account for the costs of
any land-use changes necessary to meet the biomass supply goal.

E-14

The GHG savings of using biomass in place of fossil fuel for electricity generation will also be
accounted for in ES-1, ES-5, and ES-7.
Key Assumptions: The proportion of each biomass feedstock used to meet the goal is based on
the proportion of current supply for each feedstock.
Key Uncertainties
•

The potential availability of the unharvested above-ground biomass growth on timberland
acres will be influenced by landowner willingness to harvest; available markets for the broad
range of biomass species, size, or condition; and costs of harvesting, processing, and
transportation.

•

Multiple initiatives propose utilization of biomass (e.g., ES, TLU and Residential,
Commercial, and Industrial [RCI]). The overlapping impacts of these initiatives on feedstock
supply need to be considered to ensure the sustainability of feedstock supply and other natural
resources.

•

On January 12, 2011, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a three-year
deferment on the inclusion of GHG emissions from biogenic sources from regulation under
the EPA GHG Tailoring Rule that went into effect on January 2, 2011. While this is positive
to the operational costs of projects currently utilizing biomass feedstocks, the continued
uncertainty may impact the increased utilization of biomass feedstocks.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Biomass production can create permanent jobs and may help offset job losses in other industries,
including the coal industry.

AFW-3. On-Farm Energy Production and Efficiency Improvements

Policy Description
Renewable energy may be produced and used on site at individual agricultural operations or
regionally through various businesses to achieve better economies of scale. For example, on-farm
production of grains and oilseeds for ethanol and biodiesel, biomass for new-generation biofuels
and electric generation, and the use of solar heating and power will reduce CO2 emissions by
displacing the use of fossil-based fuels. Energy conservation for agricultural operations will result
in increased efficiency. For example, improved grain-drying systems; livestock facility upgrades
to ventilation, lighting, heating, and cooling components; and expanded use of precision
agriculture systems will also reduce fossil fuel use.
Policy Design
Goals: Achieve a 25% improvement in the energy efficiency of agricultural operations, while
increasing the productivity and conversion of crops, residues, and other farm resources to meet
the ES, TLU, and RCI needs by 2030.
Timing: Progress is already underway, as evidenced by growth in ethanol and biodiesel
production and increased utilization of federal and state programs to improve on-farm energy
efficiency.
•

Current biomass production capabilities are estimated at 12–15 metric tons per year (t/yr) with
minimal land-use changes. Approximately 30% of this volume is expected from forestry and
woody biomass production, 30% from energy crop production, 20% from waste forest
products, and 20% from agricultural waste.

•

Potential biomass production capabilities by 2030 are estimated at 25 t/yr, but could involve
land-use changes of approximately 2 million acres, or 15% of Kentucky’s farmland.
Approximately 20% of this volume is expected from forestry and woody biomass production,
60% from energy crop production, 10% from waste forest products, and 10% from
agricultural waste.

•

Increase biomass feedstock utilization from 3–5 t/yr to an estimated 25 t/yr by 2030.

Parties Involved: Leadership is being shown on multiple fronts from governmental, educational,
agricultural, and other business entities. The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC)
is working closely with the Governor’s Office of Agricultural Policy to develop strategies for
improved on-farm energy efficiency and increasing biomass and biofuel production and
utilization. Continued funding for the Kentucky Agricultural Development Fund will provide
financial resources for research, demonstration, and capitalization in this area. The Kentucky
Agricultural Council has over 60 member agricultural, educational, and governmental
organizations that have identified agri-energy investments, education, and awareness as a priority
area. The Kentucky Renewable Energy Consortium has provided leadership in developing and

E-16

advancing a “25x’25” initiative.19 These networks are promoting dialogue, research, funding, and
policy development to advance these activities.
Other: None identified.

Identify current biofuel promotion programs and coordinate with those organizations to
develop new programs as part of a comprehensive promotion campaign.

•

Identify and develop incentives to upgrade the material handling capabilities at a coal-fired
power plant to allow co-firing of biomass at a rate of up to 10%.

•

Produce herbaceous energy crops on underutilized pasture land, abandoned or reclaimed mine
land, and abandoned agricultural land. Note: do not plant crops (invasives) that will have a
negative impact on Kentucky species. Encourage use of plants that are native or noninvasive,
or have passed testing protocols for invasiveness and overall environmental impact. Avoid

the environment than the energy they produce.
•

Produce woody energy crops (cottonwood, hybrid poplar, and black locust) on underutilized
pasture land, abandoned or reclaimed mine land, and abandoned agricultural land, and
investigate the removal of woody residues from forestry operations.

•

Implement a system to co-fire a range of feedstocks available in Kentucky at a coal power
plant:
o Develop incentives to allow farms and forests to produce feedstocks for energy production
on non-cropland.
o Demonstrate techniques for establishing energy crops on abandoned or reclaimed mine
land and other land that requires additional considerations (e.g., deep ripping, rocky, steep
slopes, or transplanting).
o Establish and demonstrate effective harvest, storage, and transportation practices for
herbaceous and woody biomass.
o Document the range in fossil energy, labor, productivity, and cost required to grow,
transport, and produce electricity from biomass.

•

Co-fire material for five days to evaluate electric power production, emissions, and other
operational changes due to co-firing biomass.

•

Evaluate alternative practices to improve the sustainability of energy crop production:
o Track changes in soil properties, adaptability to wildlife improvements, and environmental
impacts.
o Evaluate the potential of Terra Preta (biochar) for improving and sequestering carbon in
energy crop plantations.

•

Determine the overall change in GHG emissions and the cost of electric power from biomass.

•

Develop a pilot-scale project to focus on producing biomass on underutilized marginal land in
eastern and central Kentucky.

•

Convert 2 million acres, or 15% of Kentucky’s farmland, from low-valued forage and hay
production to higher-valued energy crops.

•

Establish significant levels of public–private partnerships to design, build, and operate new
farm-to-market processes.

•

Increase statewide education, workforce development, and economic development activities
to support a fast-growing biomass and biofuels industry and infrastructure.

•

Do not account for recyclable material (particularly paper and plastics) in the calculations for
available biomass for fuel purposes. The loss of this material to energy production would be
detrimental to manufacturers who use it for stock in producing products with recycled content.
The main effort toward this material should be recovery for reuse as raw materials for
manufacturing recycled-content products.

E-18

On-Farm Energy Efficiency
•

Develop outreach programs to improve on-farm energy efficiency that include identification
of areas where the greatest savings can be achieved. Examples include the use of more fuelefficient equipment, more energy-efficient lighting systems, and less energy-intensive
irrigation practices.

•

Encourage the development and adoption of life-cycle cost-benefit and carbon impact
analyses that promote options for more sustainable food production and processing.

•

Increase energy efficiency and sustainability awareness and implementation on Kentucky
farms by promoting more on-farm and local energy sources, technology upgrades to
equipment and facilities, displacement of fossil fuels, and more efficient whole-farm and
watershed planning.

•

Facilitate technology transfer from universities to the farm to augment carbon footprint
reductions. Develop the network locally to put the transfer in place.

The possible improvements will vary, depending on the size, technologies used, and type of farm.
Chicken farms, row crops, and dairy farms are likely to have very different efficiency
opportunities. Energy audits serve to inform farmers of the most cost-effective changes that can
be made to improve their overall energy efficiency. Table AFW-3-2 shows a list of the
technologies that are most often considered in each of the different farm types. This is by no
means a complete list; it is merely meant to illustrate the types of technologies that can result in
significant energy savings.

The GHG benefits were calculated based on the avoided emissions from these new technologies. The
GHG benefit for fuel savings was calculated based on the fuel-cycle emissions factor for diesel fuel
(11.25 kilograms [kg] CO2e/gallon), 22 although only the direct emissions factor (10.15 kg
CO2e/gallon) is counted as part of the in-state reductions. The CO2e associated with the electricity
saved in each year is estimated by multiplying megawatt-hours (MWh) saved by the Kentuckyspecific emission factor for electricity production, 1.017 tCO2e/MWh. This figure for
emissions/MWh comes from the Kentucky I&F, and is outlined in the Common Assumptions Memo.
Total on-farm energy use was estimated based on National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)
data. 23 It was assumed that the primary energy expenditures were on diesel fuel, propane, and
electricity. Electricity was estimated to make up 33% of total farm energy consumption, based on the
USDA national average. 24 Propane makes up 7%, and the remainder was assumed to be diesel fuel,
although it is likely that some of this will actually be gasoline. Given the similarities between
gasoline and diesel emission factors, the impact of this assumption is likely to be negligible. The
estimate of energy expenditures was converted to energy consumption, based on the average
electricity, propane, and diesel fuel price in Kentucky in 2007. This resulted in an estimated 58
million gallons of diesel fuel used on Kentucky farms, 8 million gallons of propane, and 1,132 GWh
of electricity. These figures are used as the baseline on-farm energy consumption estimate in this
analysis.
Energy audits are an essential part of improving on-farm energy efficiency in order to meet the AFW3 goal. It is assumed that these audit programs will find energy efficiency gains at a similar
cost/benefit to that of the efficiency technologies considered in this analysis, and allow the goal of a
25% reduction in on-farm energy use to be met. It was further assumed that each farm can achieve a
33% reduction in energy consumption through energy efficiency.
The energy efficiency savings possible will obviously vary from farm to farm. A 2009 University
of Kentucky report examined the costs and energy efficiency savings of various technologies on

Kentucky chicken farms. 25 This study indicated that most energy efficiency measures had a
payback period of between 1 and 7 years, with an average of 4 years. It was assumed that the
chicken farm information in the University of Kentucky study is representative of the capital
investment and energy efficiency savings that can be achieved on all Kentucky farms. If the
energy savings and costs are significantly different on varying farm types, then these results will
be subject to change.
Energy audits will target larger farms first because those are the most likely to achieve costeffective reductions. The costs of energy audits are estimated based on the estimates provided by
two New York energy auditors. The average cost of an energy audit for a Kentucky farm is
assumed to be $1,750. 26
The GHG savings from energy efficiency come from reduced electricity consumption, as well as
reduced propane and diesel fuel use. The GHG savings that can be achieved through energy
efficiency projects are shown in Table AFW-3-3, and the costs of energy efficiency are shown in
Table AFW-3-4.

EE = energy efficiency.

Key Assumptions: See text.
Key Uncertainties
Feedstock Availability
•

There are significant uncertainties regarding the quantification of economic trade-offs and
subsidies for biomass production.

•

Without more information on the types of energy being displaced, it is impossible to estimate
the overall costs or GHG savings of using biomass feedstocks versus other fuel sources.

•

The AFW-4 analysis examines the overall costs of cellulosic ethanol production, and the
AFW-2 analysis looks at electricity co-firing. The emission factors for biomass used are
national figures, and do not take into account Kentucky-specific issues. In addition, there is no
estimate of emissions/Btu for biomass in the transportation sector, since this biomass would
need to be converted into cellulosic ethanol first.

E-24

•

It would be very difficult to more than double biomass availability in Kentucky by 2030
without devoting significant new acreage to energy crops. It is uncertain if these acres are
available.

•

There would likely be significant infrastructure costs to deliver these quantities of biomass to
the needed locations in Kentucky.

•

On January 12, 2011, EPA issued a three-year deferment on the inclusion of GHG emissions
from biogenic sources from regulation under the EPA GHG Tailoring Rule that went into
effect on January 2, 2011. While this is positive to the operational costs of projects currently
utilizing biomass feedstocks, the continued uncertainty may impact the increased utilization of
biomass feedstocks.

Energy Efficiency
•

It is uncertain if the energy efficiency gains being found in the energy audit program are
realistic. It is possible that some of the energy efficiency investments needed to reach the goal
of increasing on-farm efficiency by 25% will be quite expensive. If that is the case, then the
cost estimates will not be accurate.

•

It is difficult to estimate energy consumption on Kentucky farms, because that data are not
collected in a single place. A more detailed estimate of Kentucky on-farm energy use would
improve the accuracy of this analysis.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Energy Efficiency
Reduced non-GHG pollutions caused by the combustion of diesel fuel. Many of the strategies
discussed in this section are shown to save water, labor hours, and equipment wear. There will
also likely be reductions in local air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and
nitrogen oxides (NOx) from reduced fuel consumption.
Feasibility Issues
The ability to meet the goal of this policy is dependent on setting aggressive targets for biomass
production and providing sufficient incentives.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Unanimous.
Barriers to Consensus
None.

AFW-4. In-State Liquid/Gaseous Biofuels Production

Policy Description
This policy increases the sustainable in-state production and use of liquid and gaseous biofuels
from agriculture, forestry, and municipal waste sources to displace the use of fossil fuel.
Displacement of traditional fossil fuels with biofuel usually results in a net reduction in GHGs.
This policy promotes the use of sustainable practices in production of biomass from crop residues
and dedicated biomass crops that take advantage of underutilized land resources without
detrimental effects on human food resources. Additionally, this policy would encourage the use of
agriculture and forestry crops that sequester carbon or are at least carbon neutral, as necessary for
an overall reduction in GHGs.
Biofuel technologies and production systems can take advantage of solar energy stored in biomass
from agricultural and forestry resources for liquid and gaseous biofuel production. Biofuel
systems can also capture discarded energy available in the waste stream. Emerging biofuel
technologies, such as pyrolysis, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, utilization of microorganisms, and
other novel technologies, can improve utilization of feedstocks.
Policy Design
Goals: Generate sufficient biofuels to meet Kentucky’s share of the federal Renewable Fuels
Standard. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Kentucky accounted
for 1.60% of national fuel consumption, and therefore is responsible for 335 million gallons of
renewable fuels in 2022. It is uncertain what the federal standard will be for the years 2023–2030,
but it was assumed that the quantities of biofuel required would increase from 335 million gallons
in 2022 to 479 million gallons in 2030. 27
Timing: See goal above.
Parties Involved: Private waste industry, biofuel producers, farmers and feedstock producers,
forest and agricultural landowners, municipal solid waste (MSW) managers, researchers, venture
capitalists.
Other: Ensure quantification costs reflect current federal policy.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Identify a single agency to coordinate biomass development efforts.

•

Define and develop a sustainable biomass industry.

27

This policy is tied to TLU-10 (Promote the Use of Alternative Transportation Fuels). This recommendation focuses
on in-state production of transportation biofuels, while TLU-10 focuses on the demand side. Based on current
projections of available biomass to meet the needs of this recommendation and supplies for AFW-2 (which are used
to satisfy ES sector demands from recommendations ES-2, ES-5, and ES-7), the in-state production of transportation
biofuels (cellulosic ethanol) is more than adequate to meet the needs of the TLU-10 ethanol requirements.

E-26

•

Develop capitalization mechanisms.

•

Expand applied R&D of biomass production in Kentucky.

•

Educate farmers about production opportunities as well as the species of crops, specific
varieties, and production techniques that maximize net farm income, while protecting natural
resources.

•

Encourage farmer investment in renewable energy production facilities.

•

Initiate applied R&D and implementation of more efficient byproduct utilization in Kentucky.

•

Increase educational opportunities and material for agricultural producers in the area of onfarm energy efficiency.

•

Explore and develop agreements with bordering states to cooperate in the production of
biofuels and byproduct utilization.

•

Advance state support to develop an adequate infrastructure for the delivery of biofuels within
the Commonwealth by examining the needs for infrastructure development that matches the
future supply of biofuels with the potential demand.

•

Work with the Kentucky Petroleum Marketers Association, the Kentucky Clean Fuels
Coalition, and others to locate biofuel suppliers and promote their availability to all farmers in
those markets.

•

Identify current biofuel promotion programs and coordinate with those organizations to
develop new programs as part of a comprehensive promotion campaign.

•

Produce herbaceous energy crops (switchgrass, Indian grass, big bluestem, and Miscanthus
giganteus) on underutilized pasture land, abandoned or reclaimed mine land, and abandoned
agricultural land. Note: do not plant crops (invasives) that will have a negative impact on
Kentucky species. Encourage use of plants that are native or noninvasive, or have passed
testing protocols for invasiveness and overall environmental impact. Avoid species that
excessively deplete soil or water resources—i.e., plants that are more of a drain on the
environment than the energy they produce.

•

Produce woody energy crops (cottonwood, hybrid poplar, and black locust) on underutilized
pasture land, abandoned or reclaimed mine land, and abandoned agricultural land, and
investigate the removal of woody residues from forestry operations.

•

Evaluate alternative practices to improve the sustainability of energy crop production:
o Track changes in soil properties, adaptability to wildlife improvements, and environmental
impacts.
o Evaluate the potential of Terra Preta (biochar) for improving and sequestering carbon in
energy crop plantations.

•

Determine the overall change in GHG emissions and the cost of electric power from biomass.

•

Develop a pilot-scale project to focus on producing biomass on underutilized marginal land in
eastern and central Kentucky.

E-27

•

Convert 2 million acres, or 15% of Kentucky’s farmland, from low-valued forage and hay
production to higher-valued energy crops.

•

Establish significant levels of public–private partnerships to design, build, and operate new
farm-to-market processes.

•

Increase statewide education, workforce development, and economic development activities
to support a fast-growing biomass and biofuels industry and infrastructure.

•

Do not account for recyclable material (particularly paper and plastics) in the calculations for
available biomass for fuel purposes. The loss of this material to energy production would be
detrimental to manufacturers who use it for stock in producing products with recycled content.
The main effort toward this material should be recovery for reuse as raw materials for
manufacturing recycled-content products.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

The Governor's Executive Task Force on Biomass and Biofuels Development in Kentucky
validated Kentucky’s biomass production capabilities within a sustainable environment, based
upon information gathered during the task force meetings.

Kentucky has two biorefinery locations that produce biomass-based ethanol—one from corn
and one from beverage waste. Total production capacity is 38 million gallons per year. 28

The benefits of this recommendation are dependent on developing in-state production capacity
that achieves GHG benefits beyond petroleum fuels. The advanced biofuels being considered in
this analysis are cellulosic ethanol, soy biodiesel and other non–corn-starch-based biofuels. Corn
or other starch-based ethanol currently accounts for 34 million gallons per year of potential
production in Kentucky. However, this figure has not increased in several years, and starch-based
ethanol production is not increasing in the revised renewable fuel standard (RFS), so it is not
included in this analysis.
TLU-10 is quantifying the GHG benefits of biofuels in Kentucky. To avoid double counting, this
AFW analysis will only consider the production costs and potential quantities of advanced biofuel
for Kentucky. The distribution costs and GHG savings will all be counted in the TLU analysis.
Table AFW-4-1 lists the quantity of biofuels required in each year to meet Kentucky’s share
(1.60%) of the new federal renewable fuel standard (RFS2). The RFS2 only outlines biofuel
quantities through 2022. It was assumed that there would continue to be a small increase in the
production of cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel between 2022 and 2030. The quantity of biofuels
produced in this analysis will be made to match Kentucky’s share of the RFS. Biofuel producers
will have to ensure that their feedstocks are of the type necessary to meet the RFS2 requirements,
which could exclude some types of agricultural and forest feedstocks.

Biomass Availability and Costs
Biomass availability in Kentucky was discussed earlier in this analysis, as shown in the Biomass
Supply Assessment at the beginning of this appendix. The quantity of biomass required to meet
Kentucky’s cellulosic ethanol share of the RFS2 is shown in Table AFW-4-2. While the value of
available biomass remaining in 2030 appears large, these remaining supplies are currently
presumed to be used to supply ES-2, ES-5 and ES-7. As mentioned in the biomass supply
assessment, it is possible that other feedstocks might also be available within the policy period,
such as other organic components of the municipal solid waste stream.

The costs and availability of these biomass feedstocks come from the biomass supply estimate.
Costs were divided into five categories: agricultural residues, agricultural energy crops, woody
energy crops, woody residues, and waste feedstocks. The costs used in this analysis are shown in
Table AFW-4-3, and are discussed in greater detail in the biomass supply estimate in Table AFW1, earlier in the analysis.

Cellulosic Ethanol Costs
The cellulosic ethanol costs of this recommendation are estimated based on the capital and
operating costs of cellulosic ethanol production plants. A study by NREL was used to estimate the

E-30

operation and maintenance costs of a 70-million-gallon/year cellulosic ethanol plant. 29 Annual
cellulosic ethanol production is derived from an estimated ethanol yield per ton of biomass. The
assumed yield is 70 gal/ton biomass in 2011, increasing to 90 gal/ton biomass by 2012 and to 100
gal/ton biomass by 2020. 30 The capital costs of a cellulosic plant came from an average of the
capital cost estimates for seven biofuel plants across the country. Using this method, the average
capital cost of a new cellulosic ethanol plant is $564 million. A new plant will need to be built for
every 70 million gallons of annual ethanol production needed. It was assumed that the capital costs
will be paid according to a cost recovery factor over the 20-year lifetime of the plant. The cost of
biomass feedstocks made up a significant portion (~60%) of variable costs. Therefore, we replaced
the NREL estimate of feedstock costs ($30/ton) with more current estimates of the cost of
delivered biomass, mentioned in the previous section. The plant proposed by the NREL study
produces some excess electricity, although the costs and benefits of generating this electricity are
not considered in this analysis. The wholesale costs/gallon are estimated based on overall costs
divided by gallons produced. The costs of cellulosic ethanol production are shown in Table AFW4-4.

Soy Biodiesel Costs
Kentucky’s current biodiesel capacity is 54 million gallons per year. To meet the AFW-4 goals,
this capacity will increase to 96 million gal/yr by 2030. Capital costs are estimated to be $25
million for a 25-million gal/yr plant, based on industry estimates. 31
Feedstock costs are estimated to be by far the largest portion of biodiesel costs. Soy oil is
converted into biodiesel at an efficiency of 7.5 lbs soy oil needed per gallon biodiesel. 32 This is a
relatively mature technology, so while efficiency improvements are possible, it is unlikely that
feedstock requirements will decline significantly. Soy oil costs are estimated to be $0.525/lb as of
11/12/10, based on information in The Jacobsen. 33 Soy costs have increased since 2000, but have
actually decreased since 2008. No reliable forecast for soy costs could be located; therefore, soy
costs are held constant in this analysis. Soy costs fluctuate constantly, and this has a significant
impact on overall biodiesel cost-effectiveness. For example, for every $0.10 increase in the price
of soy oil, biodiesel costs in this analysis increase by $0.75/gal. Other biodiesel production costs
are estimated to be $0.49/gal. 34 The production costs of biodiesel and the estimated cost per
gallon are provided in Table 4-5.

Retail Costs and Quantity of Biofuel Provided
The TLU-10 analysis requires costs for each biofuel. These costs are based on the production
costs, although there are other costs that must be accounted for to estimate the cost at the pump. It
can be difficult to estimate the difference in fuel costs between wholesale (cost to the producer)
and retail (cost to the consumer) fuel costs. The 2010 AEO does not estimate the wholesale costs
of cellulosic ethanol, but does estimate the wholesale costs of corn ethanol. When these costs are
compared with the retail cost estimates, the markup is typically $.045–$0.65/gal. 35 This figure is
used as a stand-in for the cost difference between wholesale and retail cellulosic ethanol. This
factor is not applied to biodiesel because it is assumed to be included in overall biodiesel
production costs. The delivered costs of biofuels are displayed in Table AFW-4-6. These fuel
costs and quantities, and the resulting GHG savings of biofuel usage are calculated in the TLU-10
analysis.

Key Uncertainties
•

This recommendation’s costs are highly dependent on the price of feedstock, which is still
relatively uncertain for many types of feedstock. If feedstock prices prove higher on a per-ton
basis than currently estimated, then this recommendation may have a net cost rather than a net
revenue.

•

Emission factors for these fuels come from national estimates. Depending on the blending,
components, and production practices, emission factors can be significantly affected.

•

There is considerable uncertainty in modeling the indirect effects (land-use changes) of
biofuel production.

•

Lack of a robust feedstock portfolio, including an inventory of potential lands for energy
plantations, makes it very difficult to clearly identify barriers to increased availability and
supply, and to understand the cumulative impact on the sustainability of feedstock, food/fiber,
and other commodity supplies and natural resources. Additional study is needed on this topic
to ensure that crop lands devoted to energy feedstocks do not adversely affect Kentucky’s
ability meet its needs for food and fiber. For example, to supply the 96 million gallons of

E-34

biodiesel by 2030, an additional 1.6 million acres of soybeans would be needed, which is
more than double the state’s current crop land devoted to soybean cultivation (assuming 1.5
gallons of soy oil/bushel and 40 bushels/acre).
•

Within the policy period, there is an expectation that new feedstock sources and energyconversion technologies will become commercially feasible. These include biodiesel from
crops suitable for marginal agricultural lands, bio-oils produced by biomass pyrolysis, and
potentially production from algal oils. These new feedstocks/conversion technologies could
greatly reduce the need for new crop acreage devoted to conventional crops (soybeans).

•

On January 12, 2011, EPA issued a three-year deferment on the inclusion of GHG emissions
from biogenic sources from regulation under the EPA GHG Tailoring Rule that went into
effect on January 2, 2011. While this is positive to the operational costs of projects currently
utilizing biomass feedstocks, the continued uncertainty may impact the increased utilization of
biomass feedstocks.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Other benefits or costs of a low-carbon fuel standard that are not quantified here include:
•

The impact (positive or negative) on other local air pollutants of concern, such as VOCs and
NOx.

•

The sustainability of production.

•

Flexibility to adjust based on the emergence of other technologies that might result in greater
or more cost-effective GHG reductions.

•

The impact on food prices.

•

The impact on fuel tax revenue.

•

The impact on the cost of goods delivery (i.e., fuel prices).

•

The impact on small engines.

•

Other environmental impacts, such as water quality and quantity, and conservation of land.

•

Creation of in-state jobs and economic development associated with feedstock production,
transport, and conversion.

The NREL study on the costs and benefits of a cellulosic ethanol plant finds that the facility
would generate additional electricity beyond the operational needs. This was not considered in the
analysis due to the uncertainty of the amount of electricity produced, although this could provide
an additional revenue stream for cellulosic producers.
A recent article in Science magazine, “Sustainable Biofuels Redux,” indicates that without proper
management, intensive biofuel production can carry with it a significant environmental cost. The
article pointed out that practices, such as conservation tillage and advanced nutrient management,

E-35

as well as additional research on low-impact biofuel production, can help mitigate the
environmental risks of expanded biofuel use. 36
Feasibility Issues
•

There is some uncertainty regarding the future in-state transportation fleet’s ability to
consume the volumes of biofuel to be produced under this recommendation. For that to
happen, it will require coordinated effort on both the production and the demand-sides to
ensure that the full GHG benefits are achieved. This includes the need for additional blending
facilities (either at the bulk plant or direct blending at the gasoline station) and a large flexfuel fleet to consume higher ethanol blends. (See TLU-10 for more information.)

AFW-5. Soil Carbon Management

Policy Description
The amount of carbon stored in the soil can be increased by the adoption of such practices as
conservation, no-till cultivation, and crop rotation. Reducing summer fallow and increasing
winter cover crops are complementary practices that reduce the need for conventional tillage. In
addition, the application of biochar (i.e., charcoal) may also increase soil carbon content and
stabilize soil carbon. By reducing mechanical soil disturbance, these practices reduce the
oxidation of soil carbon compounds and allow more stable aggregates to form. Other benefits
include reduced wind and water erosion, reduced fuel consumption, and improved wildlife
habitat. This policy recommendation would encourage soil productivity and carbon sequestration
through the use of biochar, winter over-crops, and such practices as crimping/rolling. 37
Note that Kentucky may lead the country in no-till agriculture. Kentucky farmers have made a
considerable shift to no-till agriculture in the last decade. Consequently, this policy
recommendation may have limited potential in Kentucky compared to other states.
Policy Design
Goals: Increase the number of acres using tillage practices that increase the amount of soil carbon
and reduce GHG emissions, including:
•

Plant winter cover crops on 50% of the currently winter-fallow land by 2030.

•

Convert 25% of the currently conventionally tilled land to no-till or reduced-tillage by 2030.

•

Encourage development and production of nitrogen-fixing crops that return nitrogen to the
soil.

Timing: Linear rate of implementation through 2030.
Parties Involved: Kentucky Department of Agriculture, USDA, private farmers.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
Soil Carbon Management
•

Promote conservation tillage for GHG benefits.

37

“‘Cover crop rolling’ is an advanced no-till technique. It involves flattening a high-biomass cover crop to produce a
thick, uniform mat of mulch. A cash crop is then no-tilled into the mulch. If the right kind of roller is used on the
right cover crop at the right time, the rolling process itself will kill or partially kill the cover crop.” From Introduction
to cover crop rolling and the Virginia-USDA Crimper Roller Demonstration Project, 2006, United States Department
of Agriculture. Available at: ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/VA/Technical/conservation_planning/Crop_Agr/
VA.Roller.FS.Sept.06.III.pdf.

E-37

•

Based on existing research, develop and conduct targeted research programs to identify crop
systems that could achieve soil carbon gains through changes in practices/technology, while
still achieving net GHG benefits per unit of output (i.e., taking into consideration soil carbon
gains, energy consumption, nutrient/pesticide/herbicide use, etc.). Develop and promote best
management practices for producers that are adapted to regional differences and farming
practices.

•

Promote applicable farming practices that achieve net GHG benefits by providing technical
assistance and financial support for small and medium-size farm operations.

•

Develop assessment models so that growers can make decisions on how they can reduce their
carbon footprint. This can be enhanced with support of emerging approaches to increase longterm soil carbon content, such as conservation tillage roller crimpers, which combine winter
cover crops with conservation tillage, while reducing or eliminating the need for chemical
fertilizers. Also, explore new approaches, like the application of biochar, which may enhance
soil carbon stability.

•

Work locally through Conservation Districts to get back to basics on equipment and
techniques to make conservation tillage successful.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

The 2007 Federal Farm Bill offers a variety of cost-share programs for landowners
implementing USDA NRCS practices.

•

USDA NRCS offers a variety of cost-share programs for producers who improve their system
management by implementing NRCS-approved practice standards.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4 and N2O: Reductions occur through a variety of methods, including carbon
sequestration in agricultural soils and potentially nitrogen mineralization; reduced life-cycle GHG
emissions through lower fuel consumption and nutrient inputs; and reduced N2O emissions from
nitrogen runoff or leaching.

Total

$MM = million dollars; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; NT/CT = no till/conservation tillage.

Total harvested cropland in Kentucky was estimated at about 5.1 million acres in 2007. 38 For the
purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that conservation practices include conservation till (no-till
(NT) and strip-till) and other conservation farming practices that provide enhanced ground cover,
or other crop management practices that achieve similar soil carbon benefits. Conservation tillage
(CT) is defined as any system that leaves 50% or more of the soil covered with residue. 39

38

USDA. Kentucky Fact Sheet. Available at: http://www.ers.usda.gov/statefacts/KY.htm.

39

The definitions of tillage practices from the Conservation Technology Information Center are used under this
policy. However, only no-till/strip-till and ridge-till are considered “conservation tillage” practices. No-till means
leaving the residue from last year’s crop undisturbed until planting. Strip-till means no more than one-third of the row
width is disturbed with a coulter, residue manager, or specialized shank that creates a strip. If shanks are used,
nutrients may be injected at the same time. Ridge-till means that 4–6-inch-high ridges are formed at cultivation.
Planters using specialized attachments scrape off the top 2 inches of the ridge before placing the seed in the ground.

E-39

Based on the policy design parameters, the schedule for acres to be put into conservation
tillage/no-till cultivation is displayed in Table AFW-5-2. This table shows the number of
additional NT/CT acres that need to be adopted by 2030. Data from the Conservation Technology
Information Center indicated that no-till practices are common in Kentucky, accounting for 55%
of acres in 2004. 40
This analysis assumes that the rate of carbon accumulation occurs for 20 years, which extends
beyond the policy period. It is assumed that the sequestration rate of 1.25 tCO2e/acre/yr provided
by the Nicholas Institute for the carbon credit program is reliable for the state of Kentucky. 41
Additional GHG savings from reduced fossil fuel consumption are estimated by multiplying the
fossil diesel emission factor and diesel fuel reduction per acre estimate. The reduction in fossil
diesel fuel use from the adoption of CT methods is 3.5 gal/acre. 42 The in-state fossil diesel GHG
emission factor of 10.15 tCO2e/1,000 gal was then multiplied by the gallons saved to get tons of
CO2e reduced. 43
There are also GHG savings estimated based on reductions in commercial fertilizer use. It was
estimated that NT/CT practices can reduce nitrogen (N) fertilizer needs by as much as 50%–
90%. 44 In an effort to be conservative, the 50% reduction estimate was used. This was applied to
the average N fertilizer application on each farm acre (6.9 kg N/acre), estimated by dividing total
N applications in Kentucky (from the I&F) by the number of farmland acres in Kentucky (14.0
million). The GHG savings were estimated based on the percentage reduction in N application
multiplied by the overall emissions from N application (from the I&F). This is then combined
with a figure for the life-cycle emissions of N fertilizer to account for the rest of the emissions
associated with fertilizer manufacturing, transport, and application (0.857 kg CO2e/kg of N). 45
These life-cycle emissions are added separately, because they are likely to occur out of state.
GHG savings from carbon sequestration and reduced fuel and fertilizer use are shown in Table
AFW-5-2.

Kentucky has one of the highest rates of NT/CT practices in the country, and while the costeffectiveness of NT/CT will vary based on factors on the ground, it can in many cases be the most
cost-effective management practice. 46 The costs of additional NT/CT come from a University of
Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service publication on no-till wheat, which found that NT/CT
practices resulted in slightly reduced yield, which amounted to lost revenue of just over $17. 47
There are also cost savings associated with NT/CT from reduced fuel and nitrogen requirements.
The cost savings from reduced fuel consumption are estimated by multiplying the gallons saved
by the forecast price for diesel in that year. The cost savings of reduced fertilizer use are estimated
by multiplying the tons of fertilizer saved by the cost of fertilizer ($435/ton). The costs of this
expansion of NT/CT practices in Kentucky are shown in Table AFW-5-4.

Winter Cover Crops
Winter cover crops can allow farmers to increase their revenue by growing an additional crop
during the winter months. Kentucky is one of the few states where these types of management
practices are viable and can improve revenue. It is possible to grow a winter cover crop of clover
or hairy vetch, which both have nitrogen-fixing properties, and can decrease the overall amount of
N applications required. Potential revenue and GHG savings are possible from reduced N
requirements, but these were not included in this analysis due to lack of data.
The goal is to plant winter cover crops on 50% of the currently winter fallow land by 2030. The
acres of winter fallow land in Kentucky were estimated based on the acres of corn and soybean
crops, minus the acres of wheat, barley, and oat crops. This assumes that corn and soybeans are
the crops most likely to be fallow during the winter, and that all wheat, barley, and oat crops in
the state are grown as winter crops. According to the NASS, there were an estimated 2.48 million

E-43

acres of corn and soybean crops in Kentucky in 2007. 48 Winter wheat, oats, and barley accounted
for 240,000 acres in 2007. 49 Therefore, there are an estimated 2.24 million acres of winter fallow
land in Kentucky. Based on this estimate, the goal for this recommendation is to convert 1.12
million of these acres into winter cover crops by 2030.
Carbon sequestration for winter cover crops includes 1.69 tCO2e/acre/yr provided by the Nicholas
Institute. 50 This figure will be multiplied by the number of acres in the program to estimate total
GHG savings.
The costs and cost savings of winter cover crops come from a publication by the Appropriate
Technology Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA) group, which estimates a seeding cost of $46/acre
for winter cover crops. 51 This is partially offset by the estimated increase in revenue of $17/acre
when comparing winter cover crops with winter fallow land. 52 It is important to note that there is
a tradeoff here when winter cover crops replace fallow land. When farmers of corn and soybean
crops choose not to grow a winter cover crop, they can lengthen the growing season of their
primary crop, which can increase revenues. The ATTRA study found that growing a winter cover
crop on average had more revenue than letting the land remain fallow, but it is possible that this
will depend on a variety of factors, such as the sale price of soybeans, corn, and small grains, as
well as the costs of such inputs as N fertilizers. The GHG sequestration as well as costs and cost
savings are shown in Table AFW-5-5.

The estimate of costs comes from establishment costs for seeding, from the ATTRA publication: “Overview of

cites a cost figure of $28/acre for seeding winter cover crops. These costs are discounted forward to 2005 dollars,
which results in a cost of $46/acre.

ATTRA publication: “Overview of Cover Crops and Green Manures.” July 2003. Available at:

value, compared with revenue of $54/acre for fallow land. This net profit of $10/acre was then discounted forward to
2005 dollars, which results in a profit of $17/acre.

Key Assumptions: See text.
Key Uncertainties
•

The GHG sequestration for NT/CT and winter cover crops comes from a Nicholas Institute
publication on the nationals average GHG savings achieved from these practices. It is possible
that these averages do not reflect GHG savings in Kentucky.

•

The costs of both of these practices will vary based on a variety of local conditions, such as
crop, equipment, and fuel prices. Given the popularity of NT/CT practices in Kentucky, it is
possible that the costs of expanding NT/CT are overestimated in this analysis.

Additional Benefits and Costs
One benefit of many types of winter cover crops is nitrogen fixation, which can reduce the need
for additional N inputs. This could result in both GHG and cost savings.

AFW-6. Increase Productivity of Abandoned, Underutilized, and Reclaimed Lands

Policy Description
Establish crops on abandoned, underutilized, reclaimed, previously mined, and marginal
agricultural lands that are not currently producing. Plant forage crops, native grasses, or energy
crops, as appropriate. In addition, implement such practices as site and soil preparation, erosion
control, and addition of soil additives to ensure conditions that support healthy growth. This
policy can include planting on previously mined surface mines where appropriate.
The production of crops is the best use for much of the previously mined land in Kentucky due to
site conditions or constraints. Improving the productivity of all mined lands will increase land
value and foster better stewardship by landowners. Furthermore, production of biomass crops on
marginal lands could help Kentucky meet its renewable energy goals without the need to convert
food-producing agricultural lands to biomass production.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Carry out inventory and evaluation of candidate acres amenable to crop production. (This will
be completed in conjunction with AFW-7, which promotes afforestation and reforestation.)

•

Convert 20% of currently available post-mined and abandoned agricultural land to biomass
crop production by 2030.

•

Increased per-area yields of crops raised on mined areas through application of soil
amendments.

Timing: Linear implementation through 2030.
Parties Involved: Improving mined land productivity will involve individual landowners and
groups that represent/communicate with landowners interacting with entities that provide
technical information on productivity improvement practices, entities that provide information on
where landowners can find vendors and materials needed to effect productivity improvement
practices and entities, and institutions that provide financial incentives for landowners to become
better stewards of their land.
These include private landowners, mining companies, farmers, foresters, Department of Natural
Resources (DNR), Division of Mine Permits, Division of Mine Reclamation Enforcement,
Kentucky Division of Forestry, Kentucky Department of Agriculture, Office of Surface Mining
Reclamation and Enforcement ([OSM] U.S. Department of the Interior), NRCS, Kentucky
Division of Conservation, Kentucky Division of Water, The Appalachian Regional Reforestation
Initiative, the University of Kentucky.
Other: Mined areas that are sloped are generally suitable for tree crops due to the substrates being
less compacted and better drained than mined areas that are flat. Flat areas are generally more
suitable for the production of crops of herbaceous plants. The productivity of flat areas used for
E-47

the production of forage crops can be improved by application of soil amendments. The most
economical way to improve the productivity of herbaceous crops is to apply amendments that
increase soil pH, thereby increasing the availability of nutrients to plants. Flat areas not used for
the production of forage crops are typically dominated by herbaceous plants and smaller amounts
of shrubs and trees. The productivity of these areas can be improved by converting them to
complete forest cover, which will increase the rate of soil development/productivity and provide
numerous ecosystem and economic benefits.
Improving mined land productivity through forest establishment involves a long-term investment
by a landowner. The threat of investment loss due to wildfire is a significant disincentive for
forest establishment.
It should be noted that sites that were mined for coal after 1977 must be reclaimed to a condition
capable of supporting an approved “post-mining land use” (PMLU) that is in accordance with the
landowner’s wishes and identified in the permit application. To achieve complete bond release,
the permittee must make a demonstration to the Cabinet that the land use has been achieved and
must provide several years of productivity demonstrations supportive of the approved PMLU
(e.g., number of tree stems/acre, hay in tons/acre, animal units/acre, bushels of corn/acre, etc.).
There is a minimum 5-year bond liability period after mining and reclamation has been
completed. Once a mine site has been granted a complete bond release. OSM then terminates
jurisdiction over the permit area, and control is relinquished back to the surface owner.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Carry out inventory/assessment of candidate abandoned, underutilized, reclaimed, or
previously mined sites in the state that are amenable to planting.

•

Create "best practices" documentation for planting on these categories of land.

•

Provide landowner incentives, such as conservation easements, cost-sharing programs, and tax
credits.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

OSM has a working group that reviews current reclamation policies and practices and
provides guidance for development on mined lands.

•

Note that the Kentucky DNR has jurisdiction over reclaimed mined lands.

•

USDA’s Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was included in the 2008 Farm Bill.
BCAP provides payments of up to 75% of the costs of establishing eligible perennial crops.
BCAP producers must be part of a “BCAP project area” that is physically located within an
economically viable distance from a biomass conversion facility.

Data Sources
•

Estimates of underutilized post-mined and agricultural lands in Kentucky, expected biomass
crop yield, and the energy content of the biomass were obtained from a study of bioenergy
potential on marginal lands by DeBolt et al. 53 DeBolt calculated the area of underutilized
agricultural lands in Kentucky by analyzing historical data records to identify change on land
that had been abandoned from use in agriculture but that had not transitioned to secondary
forests, urban areas, aquatic ecosystems (such as rivers, streams, and wetlands), or transit
infrastructure. DeBolt estimated the area of underutilized post-mined lands, lands that were in
production and are now fallow, based on data from the Kentucky State Abandoned Mine
Report for coal (2008), the Kentucky Mine Mapping Information System (2008), and
Kentucky Geological Survey (2007) annual reports for examining enterprise land-use shifts
other than coal. 54 The energy content of the biomass from the DeBolt study assumes co-firing
with coal. The crop yield and energy content values for switchgrass were chosen because they
are roughly midway between the values for the other two biomass crop species considered in
the study (eastern gamagrass and big bluestem).

•

The estimated cost of biomass crop production ($40/dry ton) was taken from the final report
of the Kentucky Task Force on Biomass and Biofuels Development. 55 The cost of delivered
coal for electricity production for the Southeast Region was taken from EIA’s AEO 2010. 56
These values are shown in Table AFW-6-3.

Quantification Methods
Biomass Crops
The amount of currently available land was estimated by adding the amounts of underutilized
post-mined lands (0.3 million hectares or 741,316 acres)) and underutilized agricultural land (1.9
million hectares or 4,695,002 acres). Quantification parameters are summarized in Table AFW-62. The goal of converting 20% of this land to biomass crop production by 2030 was assumed to be
linearly implemented over the 2012–2030 period, as shown in Table AFW-6-3. The amount of
energy produced from biomass crops grown on these lands was estimated using the amount of
land converted, and the crop yield and energy content from the DeBolt study (3.25 t/acre and
0.0178 MMBtu/kg). Since biomass fuel is renewable, the CO2 emissions from combustion of this
fuel do not contribute to overall GHG emissions. Therefore, replacing a portion of coal with
biomass fuel reduces emissions. The amount of emissions avoided was estimated by assuming
that an amount of coal equal to the amount of biomass in terms of energy produced would be
replaced, reducing emissions by 0.096 tCO2e/MMBtu.
Biomass production costs were estimated based on the per-acre crop yield and the estimate of $40
per dry ton of biomass. The overall cost was estimated by subtracting the cost of the replaced coal
from the cost of biomass production.

Soil Amendments
The costs and benefits of using soil amendments to increase productivity on marginal lands were
not quantified. While a number of studies have suggested an increase in productivity on lands
using coal combustion by-products and other types of soil amendments, quantitative
measurements of the increase in carbon sequestration were not available. Also, the effects of soil
amendments can vary widely, depending on the type of amendment, the condition of the soil, and
the species being grown. A University of Kentucky study found that compost and fertilizer soil
amendments improved productivity in loblolly pine in plots in eastern Kentucky, but not in plots
located western Kentucky. For northern red oak, productivity appeared to be inhibited by the use
of compost without fertilizer in western Kentucky, while this was not the case in eastern
Kentucky. 57 More study is needed to determine the benefits of using soil amendments on specific
types of land and plant species in Kentucky.

Key Assumptions: A full life-cycle assessment, including the energy required for agricultural
production, coal mining, and processing and transportation of biomass and coal, was not included
in this quantification. Also, soil carbon sequestration from biomass cultivation was not included.
Key Uncertainties
•

There is uncertainty associated with the cost of biomass production. Cultivation of biomass on
potentially degraded land may be more expensive than $40/dry ton, due to lower yields and
additional fertilizer or soil amendment needs. Estimates of crop yields and energy content are
also uncertain. A recent study by Aravindhakshan et al. estimated a cost of $7/tCO2e for
replacing coal with biomass. 58 This study assumed a cost of $40/dry ton for biomass with an
energy content of 0.015 MMBtu/kg and a cost of $1.83/MMBtu for coal.

•

On January 12, 2011, EPA issued a three-year deferment on the inclusion of GHG emissions
from biogenic sources from regulation under the EPA GHG Tailoring Rule that went into
effect on January 2, 2011. While this is positive to the operational costs of projects currently
utilizing biomass feedstocks, the continued uncertainty may impact the increased utilization of
biomass feedstocks.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Cultivating biomass crops and increasing the productivity of forage crops on abandoned lands
would increase soil and biomass carbon sequestration on these lands.

AFW-7. Reforestation, Afforestation, and Restoration of
Mined Lands and Other Non-forested Lands

Policy Description
Establish forests on lands that are not currently forested (e.g., underutilized land not currently in
agricultural production, forest, or development—“afforestation”), and promote forest cover and
associated carbon stocks by regenerating or establishing forests in areas with little or no present
forest cover (“reforestation”). In addition, implement such practices as site and soil preparation,
erosion control, and stand stocking to ensure conditions that support forest growth. This policy
can include forestation of previously mined surface mines, as well as non-forested riparian areas.
Promote mine reforestation practices that (1) plant high-value hardwood trees on reclaimed coalmined lands, (2) increase the survival and growth rates of planted trees, and (3) expedite the
establishment of forest habitat through natural succession.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Promote abandoned and mined land reforestation—Increase the number of post-mined acres
reforested annually by 10% per year by 2020.

•

Encourage reforestation and afforestation—Increase the number of acres converted to
forestland by 300,000 acres by 2030.

Timing: Linear implementation of goal through 2030.
Parties Involved
•

Promote abandoned and mined land reforestation—DNR, Division of Mine Permits, Division
of Mine Reclamation Enforcement, Kentucky Division of Forestry, Kentucky Department of
Fish and Wildlife Resources, OSM, NRCS, Kentucky Division of Conservation, Kentucky
Division of Water, Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative (ARRI), University of
Kentucky.

•

Encourage reforestation and afforestation—Kentucky Woodland Owners Association,
Kentucky Division of Forestry, Kentucky Resources Council, Division of Conservation,
Kentucky Farm Bureau, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, NRCS,
Kentucky Tree Farm Committee, Mountain Association for Community Economic
Development, Kentucky Forest Industries Association, state senators and representatives,
University of Kentucky.

Other
•

Clarify targets focused on reforestation (AFW-7) versus planting (AFW-6).

E-53

•

Re-establish trees, at appropriate spacing, on forested land that is currently understocked.
Interplant stands that are currently thinner than carrying capacity to increase biomass and
diversify age classes.

•

Avoid planting monocultures to minimize the risks of insects and disease, while increasing the
habitat value for wildlife and overall biodiversity. Favor the planting of native trees
appropriate to habitat type and local climate conditions. Consider future climate trends and
plant species most able to adapt and thrive over changing conditions.

Implementation Mechanisms
•

Increase the number of conservation easements, forestland tax credits legislation, and costshare funding available for reforestation.

•

Implement the Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA) developed by scientists at the
University of Kentucky and other research institutions across Appalachia.

•

Encourage the active mining industry in Kentucky to implement the FRA approach on new
mine sites.

•

Promote restoration of forests on older or "legacy" surface mines (pre-federal law and postfederal law mine sites), such as abandoned mine land sites, bond forfeiture sites, or any postbond release surface mines in Kentucky where reclamation took place without the benefits of
proper reforestation.

•

Encourage backfilling or covering of previously mined areas with acceptable rooting medium
that will support trees and cover highly alkaline materials.

•

Provide education on species that are most likely to survive, compatible with site conditions,
and that will provide long-term erosion control.

•

Carry out an inventory/assessment of candidate sites in the state that are amenable to
reforestation. Create reforestation plans for these sites.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

The FRA focuses on foresting reclaimed coal-mined land under the Surface Mining Control
and Reclamation Act (http://arri.osmre.gov/FRApproach.shtm).

•

ARRI is a cooperative effort by the Appalachian states and OSM to encourage restoration of
high-quality forests on reclaimed coal mines in the eastern United States and to promote the
FRA. (See more details at http://arri.osmre.gov/ and http://arri.osmre.gov/
Partnerships/green_forest_works/gfw.htm.)

•

OSM has a working group that reviews current reclamation policies and practices and
provides guidance to promote woody species use and development on mined lands.

•

Note that the Kentucky DNR has jurisdiction of reclaimed mined lands.

Data Sources
•

The number of acres of afforested post-mined land for 2008, 2009, and 2010 was obtained
from Phase III bond release data, which reflect 5 years of successful revegetation. 59 The cost
savings from reforesting using FRA compared to other reclamation practices was obtained
from the University of Kentucky Land Reclamation Web site. 60 Estimates of carbon
sequestration rates for reclaimed mine sites with different post-mining land uses were
obtained from a review paper by Sperow. 61 Carbon sequestration rates as high as 2.8 t/hectare
have been measured in post-mined lands reclaimed using the FRA method. 62 However,
because of variation in the carbon sequestration potential of different lands, the slightly lower
value of 2.5 t/hectare from the Sperow review was chosen as a more conservative estimate.

•

The costs associated with establishing and managing forestland were obtained from a USFS
report on private timberland conversion and management. 63 Carbon stocks for oak-pine stands
in the Southeast were also obtained from the USFS. 64

Quantification Methods: Table AFW-7-2 presents the quantification inputs for post-mined
lands. The current level of reforestation of mined lands was estimated by averaging the Phase III
bond release acreages for 2008, 2009, and 2010, resulting in 3,018 acres. This acreage is assumed
to increase by 10% per year, and the amount over 3,018 acres is assumed to be the additional

assumed to be converted to wildlife habitat, which is required to be at least 30% forested. The
per-acre increase in carbon sequestration over BAU was estimated by subtracting the estimated
carbon sequestration for wildlife habitat from the estimated carbon sequestration for reforested
lands. Carbon sequestration for wildlife habitat was estimated by using a weighted average of

For other nonforested lands, the goal of reaching reforestation/afforestation of 300,000 acres was
assumed to be implemented linearly over the 2011–2030 period. Acreages were calculated for
three stand age ranges (0–5 years, 5–10 years, and 10–20 years). Carbon sequestration rates were
estimated for these age ranges by calculating the average annual increase in carbon from the
USFS carbon stock data for oak-pine stands in the Southeast at stand ages of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20
years, shown in Table AFW-7-4. The carbon sequestered by each stand age range was then
summed to estimate the total carbon sequestered by all acres in the program. Program costs were
estimated by multiplying the total cumulative acres by per acre estimates of Conservation Reserve
Program (CRP) payments to landowners ($106/acre/year) and site preparation, planting, and
management costs. Also included in the annual cost estimate was the annual salary for the hiring
one new forester ($70,000). GHG reductions and costs are summarized in Table AFW-7-5.

MMtCO2e/yr = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.

Key Assumptions: Land that is not reforested after mining use is assumed to be converted to
wildlife habitat, which is required to be at least 30% forested. For calculating carbon
sequestration of wildlife habitat, this land use was assumed to be 70% grassland and 30% forest. 65
Key Uncertainties
There is significant uncertainty associated with carbon sequestration rates, particularly those for
mine lands. Amichev et al. found that rates of carbon capture ranged from 0.7 to 6.7 metric tons
per hectare (or 1.91 to 18.2 tons per acre), depending on mine soil quality. 66

AFW-8. Advanced MSW Reuse, Recycling, and
Organic Waste Management Programs

Policy Description
Increase the reuse and recycling and reduce the generation of waste in order to limit GHG
emissions associated with landfill methane generation and with the production of raw materials
relative to recycled materials. Increase the breadth and depth of recycling programs, provide
incentives for the recycling of construction materials, enhance markets for recycled materials, and
increase average participation/recovery rates for all existing programs. Encourage the reduction of
the biodegradable volume of waste emplaced through recycling and composting of organic wastes
(e.g., lawn and garden waste, food waste, wood, and paper). Encourage the conversion of the
wastes from composting, anaerobic digestion, or other technologies from residential, commercial,
and government sectors through programs that reduce the generation of wastes. Reduce waste
generation at the source to reduce both landfill emissions as well as upstream production
emissions, and reduce the energy needs associated with handling and disposing of the wastes.
Note the linkage to AFW-9 covering landfill methane energy programs. To the extent that this
policy achieves lower levels of biodegradable waste emplacement in the future, lower levels of
landfill methane will be generated.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Achieve a 40% recycling rate for common household recyclable materials by 2025.

•

Achieve a 50% diversion rate for all MSW by 2025.

Timing: In 2008, Kentuckians recycled 34.6% of common household recyclable materials
(aluminum, cardboard, steel, plastic, newspaper, glass, and paper) and 39% of all MSW,
including common household recyclables and sludge, concrete, compost, and asphalt. Beginning
in 2004, recyclers were required to report annually to their respective county the amount of MSW
collected for recycling. This has helped the state to track the amount of materials recycled.
Kentucky’s PRIDE (Personal Responsibility in a Desirable Environment) Fund was amended, and
in 2007, the first recycling grants were awarded to local governments to pay for the development
and expansion of recycling programs and household hazardous waste management. Kentucky
Recycling Interest Group (KRIG) joined KPPC in 2007 to facilitate a statewide program to
enhance the recycling infrastructure in the Commonwealth. KPPC also operates the Kentucky
Industrial Materials Exchange, which helps find industrial users for materials that may otherwise
end up in landfills or other disposal facilities.
Parties Involved: KEEC, private waste management and recycling companies, end users and
transporters of recycled materials, KRIG, counties and other local units of government,
environmental groups and citizens of the Commonwealth, Kentucky Recycling and Marketing
Assistance (KRMA) Program, Area Development Districts (ADDs).

E-60

Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Continue education efforts across the Commonwealth, focusing on reducing the waste
generated, reusing materials to the extent possible, and recycling as much of the waste
generated as possible.

•

Include the goal of achieving a 40% recycling rate by 2025 in legislation in order to increase
its chances of being met.

•

Continue working with local governments to make sure they are aware of the availability of
grant funds to support recycling efforts in their communities.

•

Continue the support, development, and expansion of markets for all recycled materials, as is
currently the mission of the KRMA Program.

•

Encourage efforts by cities and county governments to develop infrastructure for recycling.

•

Encourage efforts by local governments and ADDs to develop cooperative agreements with
other local governments in their areas for the purposes of developing regional recycling
centers.

•

Encourage efforts by private industry and local governments to begin programs to remove
biodegradable wastes from the waste stream. This includes the use of digesters, and
composting and reusing yard wastes, wastewater sludge (as long as it is done safely), and
animal wastes.

•

Consider a landfill disposal ban for electronic scrap (e-scrap) and other waste materials that
present potential environmental harm if there are acceptable reuse and recycling alternatives,
so that the ban would not result in an unacceptable increase in illegal discharge.

•

Consider deposit systems or their equivalent for high-risk or large-volume products, only if
they would create an efficient, effective, and equitable collection and utilization infrastructure.

•

Develop and implement an effective and efficient data collection system for measuring solid
waste generation, reduction, utilization, and disposal. The system should measure and track
trends on the magnitude and percentage of solid waste generated, reduced, utilized, and
disposed of. To get the most accurate recycling tonnage numbers, recycling organizations,
both commercial and government-operated, should register and report directly to KEEC. A
fee should be imposed to help cover the costs of inspecting and managing the data. The fee
should be based on a tonnage-processed sliding scale.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Local governments across the state have various levels of financial resources and infrastructure
available for recycling programs. In many rural communities, curbside recycling is not available.
Recycling grants are available to counties and cities through the Kentucky PRIDE Fund, which is
administered by KEEC. In 2002, House Bill 174, the legislation creating PRIDE, was passed,
which established an environmental remediation fee of $1.75 per ton on solid waste disposed of in
Kentucky. In 2006, Senate Bill 50 amended the statute to provide grant funds for recycling and
household hazardous waste. The PRIDE Fund currently generates approximately $10.8 million

E-61

per year, of which $5 million can be used for open-dump cleanups, recycling, and household
hazardous waste grants. In addition to the programs identified previously, Kentucky has a Waste
Tire Trust Fund, administered by KEEC, which provides funding for “waste tire amnesties” to
address waste tires found and to help in development of recycling and end-use markets for waste
tires in the state. KEEC also issues crumb rubber grants to schools and communities yearly from
monies provided by the Waste Tire Trust Fund. Kentucky’s state paper recycling program, which
serves more than 115 state agencies in Frankfort, offers free pickup and free document destruction
of governmental office paper.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
•

Avoided emission of CH4 at MSW landfills due to a reduction in the total amount of waste
deposited at landfills.

•

Avoided emission of CO2 and associated GHGs from the reduction of the amount of virgin
materials and energy consumption necessary for the production of products and packaging, as
the total mass produced of these items would be reduced. The EPA WAste Reduction Model
(WARM) used to estimate these reductions accounts for the origin of carbon sequestered in
raw materials. 67 Therefore, CO2 emissions from the combustion or decomposition of biogenic
waste are not counted toward the total emissions. CH4 and N2O emissions due to landfilling or
combustion of biogenic waste, as well as avoided future CO2 sequestration, are counted
toward the net fuel-cycle emissions of each waste management practice.

•

Avoided emission of CO2 and associated GHGs due to reduced amount of material
transported.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Data Sources
•

GHG emission reductions were estimated using WARM. 68

•

The inputs for the model were based on updated waste management data provided by the
Kentucky Division of Waste Management (KY DWM). 69

67

“WAste Reduction Model (WARM).” November 2009. Available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/wycd/
waste/calculators/Warm_home.html. EPA created WARM to help solid waste planners and organizations track and
voluntarily report GHG emission reductions from several different waste management practices. WARM is available
both as a Web-based calculator and as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. WARM calculates and totals GHG emissions
of baseline and alternative waste management practices—source reduction, recycling, combustion, composting, and
landfilling. The model calculates emissions in tCe, tCO2e, and energy units (MMBtu) across a wide range of material
types commonly found in MSW. For an explanation of the methodology, see the EPA report Solid Waste
Management and Greenhouse Gases: A Life-Cycle Assessment of Emissions and Sinks, EPA530-R-02-006. Available
at: http://epa.gov/climatechange/wycd/waste/SWMGHGreport.html.

data used to develop the KY Waste I&F. Specifically, it was brought to light that the waste identified as “MSW” in
the DWM Annual Reports includes non-household waste, such as construction and demolition debris, which is
mostly inert (does not produce landfill gas emissions). The updated information provided by DWM allowed CCS to
break out household waste from non-household waste.

Tables AFW-8-2, AFW-8-3, AFW-8-4, and AFW-8-5 display the results of the GHG emissions
reduction and cost-effectiveness quantitative analyses for recycling and composting. Table AFW8-6 displays the 2010–2030 summary results for all elements of AFW-8. The parameters and
methods for determining cost-effectiveness for recycling and composting are different enough to
warrant separate summary tables, although these two waste management strategies are usually
grouped together under the single term “diversion.” Following these tables is more detailed
documentation of the assumptions, parameters, and calculations used to generate the estimated
GHG emission reductions and net cost of additional waste diversion activities in Kentucky. The
cumulative GHG reduction for 2010–2030 is 16.4 MMtCO2e, and the cost-effectiveness is
$10/tCO2e.
Tables AFW-8-2, AFW-8-3, AFW-8-4, and AFW-8-5 display the results of the GHG emission
reduction and cost-effective analyses for the lifetime of projects directly related to AFW-8—
meaning that a project that begins in 2030, which is assumed to have a 15-year lifespan, will
produce GHG reductions through 2044. However, only GHG reductions and net costs through
2030 for AFW-8 are counted in the summary table at the beginning of this appendix, in order to
maintain consistency with other mitigation options.

Solid Waste Historical and Projected Management Profile
The basis for the MSW management profile was the 2010 Kentucky Division of Waste
Management Annual Report, as well as input directly from KY DWM. 70 These data present the
amounts of waste landfilled, imported, exported, and recycled in Kentucky during 1994–2009.
The state data summaries provided the quantity of waste composted. 71 The amount of waste
combusted at waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities was reported directly by DWM. 72 Note that food
waste composting data were not available. The composting totals represent yard waste only.

MSW generation is defined as the sum of MSW landfill disposal, MSW combustion, and MSW
recovery. MSW combustion includes combustion at WTE facilities, combustion of commercial
and institutional waste without energy recovery, and open burning of residential waste. Recovery
includes recycling and composting.
The MSW generation totals presented in the KY DWM Waste Management Annual Report do not
include combustion. Therefore, the recycling percentages calculated in this appendix will not
match those from the KY DWM report. KY DWM states that the 2005 MSW recycling rate in
Kentucky was 23.4%, compared to the national 2005 MSW recycling rate of 30.0%.
The amount of waste generated was back-cast for each year between 1990 and 1994 by applying
the calculated 1994 per-capita MSW generation rate (based on U.S. Census Bureau population
data) to the population in Kentucky for 1990 through 1993. The MSW generation was forecast
through 2030 by applying the 2009 per-capita generation rate of 1.51 tons/person/year by the
projected population in each year. The amounts of waste recycled, composted, landfilled, and
combusted were estimated in the back-cast years by maintaining the ratios of waste managed
through these methods for the periods 1990–1993 and 2009–2030. A subset of the data and
projections is presented in Table AFW-8-7, the BAU waste management profile.
Typically, MSW includes only residential and commercial waste that would be accepted at most
non-hazardous waste disposal facilities. However, the “MSW” figures reported in the KY DWM
annual reports include non-household waste, such as construction and demolition (C&D) debris
and sewage sludge used for daily cover. 73 In direct communication with CCS, KY DWM
suggested that CCS utilize the U.S. average per-person household waste generation rate of 4.5
lbs/person/day to estimate household waste generation in Kentucky. The BAU household waste
management projection is displayed in Table AFW-8-8. The remaining tons of waste from the
overall waste management profile that are not included in the household waste management
forecast are assumed to be non-household waste. The BAU non-household waste forecast is
shown in Table AFW-8-9.

73

Per the Policy Design section of AFW-8 completed by the AFW TWG, the assumed household waste materials
include aluminum, cardboard, steel, plastic, newspaper, glass, and paper. Compostable organics are assumed to be
excluded from household waste. It is assumed that only household waste is combusted.

BAU = business as usual.

The AFW TWG goals to divert 40% of household waste and 50% of all waste by 2025 were
applied to the BAU forecasts described in the previous three tables. The amount of non-household
E-70

waste diverted under the policy scenario is found by multiplying total generation in Kentucky in
2025 by 50%, then subtracting the amount of household waste diverted in 2025 (40% multiplied
by the household waste generated in 2025). Note that non-household waste includes composting,
as well as recycling. The ratio of recycling to composting is held constant throughout the policy
scenario. The annual total waste diversion for both household and non-household waste is
assumed to annually ramp-up from the 2010 baseline through full implementation of the targets in
2025. The annual projected household and non-household waste management profiles for the
policy scenario are displayed in Tables AFW-8-10 and AFW-8-11. Table AFW-8-12 displays the
forecast incremental recycling and composting that results from the implementation of the
AFW-8 targets.

The direct GHG emission reduction estimates that are based on the preceding BAU and Policy
scenarios do not capture the embedded energy in landfilled waste that could have been recycled.
Many waste materials—especially metals, plastics, and concrete—represent a large potential for
life-cycle GHG reductions as a result of the emissions from raw materials extraction and new
product manufacturing that are avoided when waste is recycled, rather than landfilled. Based on
its extensive experience working with international and U.S. state and regional organizations
striving to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change, CCS estimates that approximately
10% of estimated GHG reductions from additional recycling efforts is attributed to direct
reductions in methane at landfills, while the remainder of the GHG reductions is based on a

E-71

reduction in life-cycle emissions. Composting also reduces life-cycle GHG emissions from waste
management, as the finished compost product may be applied to crop fields, gardens, and
landscape construction sites to increase soil carbon and moisture retention, and reduce the need
for fossil fuel-derived nitrogen fertilizers.
Solid Waste Characterization Forecast
The BAU and policy scenario characterization for household waste is based on an EPA MSW
characterization report. 74 The disposed waste was divided between disposal at landfills and
combustion at WTE facilities according to the proportion of each management method to total waste
disposal. Table AFW-8-13 displays the source characterization data used to develop the projected
household waste characterization. Table AFW-8-14 displays the projected BAU household waste
management scenario in 2030, while Table AFW-8-15 displays the projected policy household waste
management scenario in 2030. These tables were used as input for WARM to determine the GHG
reductions resulting from increased diversion of household waste.

The non-household waste characterization is based upon three sources: the aforementioned EPA
MSW Characterization report for compostable organics (yard and food waste), a data appendix
from the North East Biosolids and Residuals Association (NEBRA) for the sewage sludge
totals, 75 and an EPA 2003 C&D waste characterization report for all other non-household waste.76
For the BAU non-household waste characterization, it is assumed that all composted materials are
yard waste. This assumption is consistent with Kentucky Division of Waste Management (DWM)
county-level waste management data from 2007. 77 For the policy non-household waste
characterization, the amount of material composted is broken down between food and yard waste
according to the EPA MSW Characterization report. 78
WARM does not provide GHG reduction estimates for sewage sludge. Therefore, as a simplifying
assumption, there is no assumed incremental change between the BAU and policy scenario
characterization for sewage sludge. The sewage sludge disposal and beneficial use (recycled as
agricultural soil amendment) totals are adjusted to 2030 based on the percentage of total
generation from the data year in the NEBRA report (2004).
Table AFW-8-16 displays the C&D waste characterization. The amount of C&D recycled is the
difference between the projected non-household waste recycled for each scenario and the sewage
sludge “recycled.” The proportion of total recycling for each C&D material is equal to its
proportional contribution to total generation. Clay bricks are not a valid recycling input for
WARM. Therefore, it is assumed that all clay bricks are disposed of at landfills.

GHG Benefits
Tables AFW-8-19 and AFW-8-20 display the WARM results for 2030 GHG reductions due to
increased diversion of household and non-household waste, respectively. Table AFW-8-19 shows
that the total GHG reduction in 2030 from increased diversion of household waste is about 0.62
MMtCO2e, but less than 1% of this total is due to incremental landfill GHG emission reductions.
The remainder of the GHG reductions is a result of the energy-cycle benefit of waste diversion.
Table AFW-8-20 shows the incremental GHG reductions from the increased diversion of nonhousehold waste. This table indicates a negative incremental landfill GHG emissions reduction.
The reason for this negative value is that dense woody materials, such as yard waste and
dimensional lumber, decay over a very long period of time and are considered by WARM to
sequester carbon at landfills. Therefore, while the energy-cycle GHG reduction for non-household
wastes is substantial, the direct GHG reductions at landfills are actually negative due to reduced
sequestration

Cost Analysis
The costs involved with recycling include additional capital and operation and maintenance
(O&M) costs for materials recycling facilities (MRFs) needed to meet the incremental demand for
processing of recyclable materials. Cost savings include avoided landfill tip fees and waste
transport cost (less any cost for recyclable material disposal and transport), and revenue generated
from recycled materials. It is assumed that collection costs with additional recycling are
equivalent to current collection costs of curbside waste and recycling pickup, as the collection
cost of additional recycling will be offset by less waste collected for disposal.
Capital and O&M costs are based on a reference case single-stream MRF. 80 The evaluation of the
reference case MRF is based on a capital cost of $8 million and an annual O&M cost of $40 per
ton. This facility processes about 60,000 tons of recyclables per year. Capital costs are annualized
using the capital recovery factor method, assuming 5% interest and a 15-year project life.
Kentucky will need about 17 new MRFs that can process 60,000 tons per year of single-stream
recyclables to meet the target set by AFW-8. Annual capital costs are found by assessing the
number of new facilities needed in each year and summing the annualized capital cost of these
facilities, in addition to any facilities still within 15 years of the start of operation.
Table AFW-8-21 displays the transportation costs and tipping fees for each waste management
strategy. These data were provided by DWM, except where noted. The values in this table were
utilized to determine the net transportation cost (or cost savings) and net disposal cost (or cost
savings) of recycling on a per-ton basis, relative to disposal strategies.

80

Reference case MRF data provided to CCS by New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and
Casella Waste Systems, Inc. These cost estimates are approximations based on recent MRFs constructed in New
York State. DWM did not provide CCS with capital and O&M costs. Therefore, these New York data were used as a
proxy.

E-79

The value of recycled materials used in this analysis is $6.50/ton for single-stream recyclables. 81
This value is highly variable; therefore, projections based on it are uncertain.

The net costs for increased composting in Kentucky were estimated by adding the additional costs
for collection (the same cost as recycling, $8.03/ton) 83 to the net cost for composting operations.
The net cost for composting operations is the sum of the capital and operating costs of
composting, minus the revenue generated through the sale of compost and the net avoided tipping
fees for landfilling or combustion (see Table AFW-8-21).
Information on the capital and operating costs of composting facilities was received from Cassella
Waste Systems, Inc., during the analysis of a similar option in Vermont. 84 These data are
summarized in Table AFW-8-22.

It is assumed that the composting facilities to be built within the policy period would tend to be

85

Conference with the AFW-3 subgroup indicated that this is a reasonable representation of the costs associated with
new composting facilities in New York.

E-80

facilities/equipment are assumed have a 15-year operating life and to be retired after 15 years. It is
assumed that a facility will be added (incurring an additional $8 million in capital cost) for every
60,000 tons of waste composted, plus additional facilities to replace those that are retired prior to
2030. Capital costs are levelized using the Cost Recovery Factor method, assuming a 15-year
project life and a 5% interest rate. As the implementation period ends in 2030, it is assumed that
no additional capital expenditure is needed past this year. The number of incremental tons that are
treated from capital assumed for this recommendation decreases linearly until the last facility has
been retired in 2045.The compost value is assumed to be $11/ton. 86
Key Assumptions
The cost analysis for recycling was not separately completed for household recyclables and C&D
waste. While the cost of additional curbside collection was only applied to household waste, all
other cost parameters are applied to household and C&D waste equally. This is a simplifying
assumption that could be improved given sufficient data availability.
For the household and non-household waste management input data to WARM, the key
assumption is that none of the goals would be achieved via existing programs in place. To the
extent that those programs will achieve, or partly achieve, the goals of this policy, the estimated
GHG reductions would be lower.
Biomass derived from landfilled waste may be diverted for use in electricity, heat, and steam
generation facilities. Such a diversion would not reduce total carbon emissions, because the
carbon in the waste biomass is biogenic. However, more of this biogenic carbon is emitted as CH4
in landfill emissions than as biomass combustion emissions. Such a diversion would likely reduce
the overall GHG emissions from landfills in Kentucky.
Imported waste is not included in this assessment. It is assumed that waste is not imported into
Kentucky for the purpose of processing recyclable materials. The assumption is that the imported
waste is sorted and sent straight to landfills or waste-to-energy facilities.
The costs for recycling assume that single-stream MRFs will be built to meet incremental
demand. While single-stream recycling can increase participation and reduce collection costs, the
capital and O&M costs at single-stream MRFs are greater than dual-stream facilities. In reality, a
mix of these facilities will be built to meet demand.
Currently, there is very little capacity to recycle glass. This is due to the energy and costs
involved in doing so. A great deal of successful glass diversion is through re-use of glass
containers. It is believed that WARM does not take the lack of glass recycling capacity into
account.

dry solids content of 55% and a bulk density of 0.5 tons/yard, the value of composted material was calculated to be
$11/ton of initial feedstock.

Key Uncertainties
Mechanisms to assess recycling penetration rates and to encourage curbside participation are
difficult to quantify.
Additional Benefits and Costs
•

Biomass, such as yard waste, might have a higher-value use as an energy source for electricity
or biofuels, as opposed to compost.

•

The cost benefit of replacing fertilizer with compost would lower the overall cost of this
policy.

•

Yard waste can be used as a stabilizer for manure in anaerobic digesters.

Feasibility Issues
Factors that could affect whether the goals can be achieved include whether the local governments
in rural communities can continue to gain the necessary resources to conduct curbside recycling
and to build the infrastructure necessary to sustain an increase in recycling efforts. Markets for
recyclable materials will also be a factor in whether recycling volumes will increase.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Unanimous.
Barriers to Consensus
None.

AFW-9. Landfill Methane Energy Programs

Policy Description
Collect and treat methane at solid waste landfill sites, including those not meeting minimum
regulatory waste emplacement volumes, which would require installation of gas collection
systems. Use the renewable energy (methane) created at landfills during anaerobic degradation of
wastes to produce power, such as electricity, steam, space heat, or motor fuels (compressed or
liquefied natural gas). Increasing use of renewable energy, including landfill gas, is noted as one
of the seven strategies under Kentucky’s November 2008 Energy Plan, Intelligent Energy Choices
for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Energy Strategy. 87 Kentucky has seven active landfill
gas-to-energy (LFGTE) projects, with several other potential candidate sites.
This recommendation is linked to AFW-8 covering waste reduction, use of waste management
feedstocks for fuels, reuse, recycling, and composting. There is also potential linkage to AFW-2
and AFW-4, which address expanding biomass utilization options to produce energy, which
would divert materials from the MSW stream that would normally go into landfills. If these
options result in a lower volume of biodegradable wastes for emplacement in landfills in the
future, lower levels of methane will be generated for collection and use as renewable energy
sources.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Implement controls or waste management options at MSW landfills, such that 50% of the
methane emissions that would be generated under uncontrolled conditions are avoided by
2025.

•

By 2025, utilize the maximum amount feasible of the 50% methane reduction above for
LFGTE purposes.

•

By 2025, increase annual renewable energy production from LFGTE projects to 88 MW/year,
which is the potential energy output equivalent of 50% of the total volume of solid waste
disposed of annually. [Depending on the outcome of the modeling for AFW-8, this goal may
need to be reduced, since there would be less waste going into the landfills.]

Timing
•

By 2025, reduce methane emissions by 50%—In terms of overall impacts to the environment
from GHG emissions, methane is 16 times more damaging than CO2. In accordance with EPA
regulations, all landfills with volumes of waste exceeding 3.2 million cubic yards (MCY) total
permitted space and 50 megagrams per year, non-methane organic carbons, must have
measures in place to contain and/or flare methane. Only 27.2% of the annual MSW disposed
of in landfills currently remains uncollected or flared, while 42.6% of the MSW is flared. By

87

Gov. Steven L. Beshear, Intelligent Energy for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy
Independence, November 2008. Available at: http://www.energy.ky.gov/energyplan2008/.
E-83

2025, with improved equipment and gas collection systems, achieve a 50% reduction in
methane emissions. This would be collection and flaring of 2,120,509 CY/yr X 0.5 = approx.
1 MCY/yr of MSW, or 13% of the waste stream.
•

By 2025, implement incentives by regulations or other measures—Currently 30% of the
annual MSW disposed of in landfills generates methane, which is collected and reused for
LFGTE. By 2025, implement incentives by regulations or other measures to facilitate and
encourage utilities and other private and public entities to use landfill gas for renewable
energy production—specifically, to increase the percentage of renewable energy produced
from LFGTE projects from its current rate of 30% of the annual total potential energy output
equivalent from solid waste disposal to 50%. In terms of potential energy generated for
electricity or natural gas use, this would be an increase from the current 52.9 MW/yr to 88
MW/yr. Of the seven active landfill sites, six are used to generate electricity, having a
combined 16.9 MW of production capacity. The seventh, by far the largest landfill in the state,
provides 0.72 million cubic feet of gas per day to an industrial park for use in steam boilers—
equal to 36 MW of energy generated, or approximately half of the methane collected at the
landfill. Studies have shown that 80% of the methane is generated within 5 years following
initial MSW disposal in the landfill. After the 5-year period, the level of methane generated is
significantly reduced.

Parties Involved: This recommendation would apply to all private and public waste management
operators of currently active Subtitle D contained landfills. 88 It would also apply to public and
private electric and gas utility entities and companies who may be consumers and end users of the
renewable energy sources provided by the methane. This would also apply to those who regulate
energy production, transportation, and use, including KEEC, the Public Protection Cabinet, the
Public Service Commission (PSC), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and U.S.
Department of Transportation, and city and county governments.
Other: It should be noted one of the main goals represented in this policy statement of increasing
the recovery of methane produced by landfills in the state for conversion to LFGTE uses would
be directly affected by implementation of several of the other options, including those that divert
biomass and other forms of biodegradable waste from emplacement in landfills. This will reduce
the amount of methane that would be produced for capture and reuse by LFGTE sites, affecting
long-range supplies of methane that may be generated by landfills. Thus, it could impact the
market and future projections of waste in place and energy potential that could be generated from
the waste.
Implementation Mechanisms
The policy goals could be achieved via a combination of improving the collection efficiency of
existing landfill gas (LFG) collection systems, developing additional LFGTE projects, or through
other methods. Implementation of this policy may require the enactment of enabling legislation
and subsequent regulation by the PSC, including development of statewide interconnection
guidelines, and/or development of a renewable portfolio standard. Policies should be designed to
incorporate the following:

88

A contained landfill consists of an area of approximately 50 acres, of which 15 acres is currently active.
E-84

•

Increase the sustainability of landfill energy management by promoting a waste management
hierarchy with a renewable energy production focus versus collection and treatment only.

•

Develop a work group of waste industry stakeholders, including landfill operators and utility
companies, who would propose measures that will help enhance the sustainability and
economic viability of renewable energy production.

•

Study financial incentives or policies that could be implemented by governmental bodies,
which will enhance the market stability and demand for renewable energies, including LFG.

•

To the extent practicable, capture and utilize LFG at all existing landfills. The policy may
need to be different for large versus small landfills. If the economics of shipment of pipeline
gas are not favorable, then the addition of some on-site facilities to use the energy might be
needed.

•

Conduct studies to determine the most appropriate policies for future waste collection and
conversion to biomass fuels.

•

Perform a survey or audit of existing LFGTEs, and develop a database of existing emissions
and collection efficiencies (e.g., possibly in coordination with EPA’s Landfill Methane
Outreach Program. Optimize energy production at existing landfill methane projects through
operational efficiency.

$1/tCO2e. Tables AFW-9-2 and AFW-9-3 displays the results of the GHG emission reduction and
cost-effective analyses for the lifetime of projects directly related to AFW-9, meaning that a
project that begins in 2030, which is assumed to have a 15-year lifespan, will produce GHG
reductions through 2044. However, only GHG reductions and net costs through 2030 are counted
in the AFW summary table at the beginning of this appendix in order to maintain consistency
with other mitigation options.

“MSW” in the DWM annual reports includes non-household waste, such as C&D debris, which is mostly inert (does
not produce landfill gas emissions). The updated information provided by DWM allowed CCS to break out household
waste from non-household waste.

GHG Benefits
Table AFW-9-2 shows the ramp-up of implementation to reach the policy goals (total incremental
control accounts for 50% of emissions at uncontrolled landfills by 2025, providing the policy goal
of 50%). The table shows the BAU uncontrolled methane emissions from the Kentucky I&F,
adjusted for the fraction of waste that is considered inert (or very slowly decomposing biogenic)
C&D debris waste. Based on the waste characterization in AFW-8, about 69% of the waste
disposed of in Kentucky landfills is household waste, compostable organics, or sewage sludge.
Next, the table provides the incremental amount of methane controlled due to the policy in each
year, and the electricity generation associated with the methane collected. Per the Policy Design
section of AFW-9, it is assumed that 50% of the methane captured at currently uncontrolled
landfills will be utilized for energy generation.
The electricity generated from this methane is shown next in Table AFW-9-2 using a nominal
heat rate of 11,078 Btu/kWh taken from the ES I&F inputs. The GHG benefit of displaced grid
electricity is calculated using the marginal grid emission factor of 1.017 tCO2e/MWh. This figure
for emissions/MWh comes from the Kentucky I&F, and is outlined in the Common Assumptions
Memo provided to the AFW TWG. The total GHG benefit is shown in the final column by
summing the columns for methane destruction and avoided electricity production based on the
portion of methane combusted that is utilized for electricity generation (50%).
Cost Analysis
Table AFW-9-3 summarizes the cost analysis. Capital costs are determined based on the
incremental LFG collected in each year, the capital cost per volume of LFG collected (based on
EPA LFGcost data shown under the Key Assumptions section below), and a capital recovery
factor of 0.096 (15-year project life, 5% interest). Annual O&M costs are also derived from
LFGcost data for a standard engine/generator set and collection system for landfills with greater
than 1 million tons of waste emplaced, small engine/generator set and collection system for
landfills with less than 1 million toms waste emplaced, and the incremental amount of LFG
E-89

collected. Revenue from the sale of electricity generated by the policy projects is estimated from
the electricity generation estimate in Table AFW-9-2 and an electricity production value based on
the EIA AEO Southeastern Reliability Coordination Agreement prices (provided in Table AFW9-3). 93 Total annual costs are the sum of annualized capital and O&M costs minus the value of
electricity produced. Discounted costs are brought back to 2009$ using a 5% discount rate. The
cost-effectiveness estimate of $1/tCO2e is determined from the total discounted costs divided by
total reductions (2010–2030).
Using the results from an LFGcost run (Tables AFW-9-4), the costs of AFW-9 implementation
are estimated based on whether the methane is converted to usable energy by a small engine or
large engine (800 kilowatts and greater, landfill waste in place [WIP] greater than 1 million
tons.). 94 Small landfills (less than 1 million tons WIP) are assumed to utilize small-engine
technology. Input data from the model were developed from the landfill data utilized for the
AFW-8 BAU waste management profile. Note that the data in Table AFW-9-4 do not include the
revenue that these projects will receive from electricity sales or energy savings. The assumed mix
of small engine versus standard engine is based on the proportion of current WIP at each class of
landfill in Kentucky. A capital recovery factor of 0.096 (15-year project life, 5% interest) is
applied to annualize capital costs.

lmop/res/index.htm.

E-90

LFGcost was used to estimate the potential tCO2e of LFG that could be captured at the average
landfill in Kentucky. This number was divided by the CH4 captured at currently uncontrolled
landfills to determine the number of landfills at which controls would be put in place. By 2025, 26
currently uncontrolled landfills would need to be controlled in order to meet the AFW-9 targets.
The number of landfills is multiplied by the fractional capital cost and fractional O&M cost from
Table AFW-9-4 to yield the annual capital cost and annual O&M cost, respectively.
Key Assumptions
The analysis only assumes the adoption of LFG controls is possible at landfills identified as
“candidate” or “potential” by the LMOP database.
Each of the cost inputs above contains key assumptions; additional study of these inputs could
reduce the associated uncertainty in the cost estimates. Key inputs to the cost analysis taken from
LFGcost include:
•

Value of electricity generated: per EIA AEO Southeastern Reliability Coordination
Agreement price forecast;

•

LFG collection efficiency: 85%;

•

LFG methane content: 50%;

•

Number of LFG wellheads (assume 1 well/acre): 62 for large landfills, 17 for small landfills;

•

Financing: 15 years (minimum expected equipment life), 5% interest rate, 100% financing.

Key Uncertainties
The analysis does not factor in the closure of specific landfills or the adoption of LFG controls at
specific landfills outside of the BAU forecast. Modeling GHG emissions and reductions at
individual sites is beyond the scope of this analysis; however, the approach used is consistent with
the methods used to develop the GHG forecast for the waste management sector.
Growth rates for organic materials being landfilled are highly uncertain and will depend on
recycling and composting goals and actual diversions. If full implementation of the AFW-8
targets is achieved, the 2030 and cumulative 2010–2030 GHG reductions that result from the
AFW-9 mitigation targets are reduced to 2.12 and 26.6 MMtCO2e, respectively. The
implementation costs should not change dramatically, since the amount of capital and O&M cost
inputs will be the same and the revenue generated should be only marginally lower than if waste
disposal continues at BAU rates.
The offset natural gas benefit estimate is based only on the global warming potential of methane,
relative to CO2. It does not account for other life-cycle emissions related to natural gas production
and combustion, which are also being offset through landfill gas utilization.
Additional Benefits and Costs
•

The reduction in LFG emissions into the atmosphere would greatly improve air quality for the
communities surrounding the landfills.

E-91

•

Collecting and utilizing LFG can reduce the risk of potentially dangerous underground
methane pockets that can occur at capped landfills.

•

Increasing the emphasis on environmentally sound post-disposal treatment of waste will
create job markets for the design, construction, and operation of controls.

ES-1. Biomass Development and Efficiency Improvements
at Existing Power Plants

Policy Description
As directed by 2007 House Bill (HB)1 and subsequent amendments to Kentucky Revised
Statutes (KRS) 152.720, the Governor’s Office of Energy Policy published a strategic action
plan, Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy
Independence 1 (Kentucky’s Energy Plan), which outlined seven strategies to restructure
Kentucky’s energy portfolio to continue Kentucky’s role as an energy leader. Although biomass
development constitutes a significant role in the first three strategies, this recommended policy
will primarily focus on Strategy 2: Increase Kentucky’s Use of Renewable Energy listed in
Kentucky’s Energy Plan. This policy recommendation is intended to include both new and
repowered existing stand-alone plants, as well as co-firing biomass at fossil-fuel electric
generating units. This policy will also include energy efficiency improvements at existing fossilfuel electric generating units.
The average coal-fired power plant in Kentucky is more than 35 years old. There have been
significant advances in power generation technology during the lives of Kentucky’s power
plants. Implementing efficiency improvements at existing power plants has the potential to
decrease carbon dioxide (CO2) and other emissions on a pound per million British thermal unit
(lb/MMBtu) basis, while at the same time reducing fuel costs. However, uncertainties in the
Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) Program pose a significant disincentive not only to
power plant efficiency improvements, but also to biomass co-firing, because in some cases such
a project may be deemed a “major modification” that results in additional emissions, triggering
additional pollution control requirements that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Refinements in the regulatory program are needed to fully achieve the potential benefits of
biomass co-firing and efficiency improvements at existing power plants.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy recommendation are to generate 4,182,000 megawatt-hours
(MWh) of electricity from biomass by 2025 and to improve the efficiency of existing generating
units greater than 250 megawatts (MW).
In accordance with the Kentucky Energy Plan, by 2025:
•

Kentucky’s biomass resources can potentially contribute more than 50% of Kentucky’s
renewable energy and energy efficiency potential.

•

New jobs can be created resulting from an energy-producing sector utilizing biomass.

•

Kentucky can utilize the estimated 3.5 million dry tons per year of underutilized woody
biomass to generate electricity to meet energy demands.

Governor Steven Beshear, Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for
Energy Independence, page v, November 2008.
F-4

•

Utilizing biomass resources can help achieve the 25% renewable energy and efficiency goal.

•

Utilizing biomass resources can provide and reach the annual target of 4,182,000 MWh.

The lack of a biomass supply chain is a major impediment to the use of biomass in Kentucky.
Biomass development will require creation of the infrastructure necessary to support the
procurement, transport, and utilization of biomass.
Promoting efficiency improvements at existing power plants has the potential to make a
significant contribution toward reduction of Kentucky’s carbon footprint. Current technologies
could achieve efficiency improvements in the range of 3%–5% for the current generating fleet.
For such an effort to be feasible, regulatory actions at both the state and the federal levels would
be necessary. Efficiency improvements will be analyzed in two steps to determine potential
cost/benefits: first, as applied to all 500-MW or greater generating units, and second as applied to
all 250–500-MW units.
Timing: The new generation and improvements should be phased in to the fleet between 2013
and 2025.
Parties Involved
•

Electric generators and biomass producers located in Kentucky may be affected by this
policy.

•

All regulatory agencies involved with permitting, determining compliance, and enforcing
regulatory requirements will also be involved in implementing this policy. The agencies
involved may include the following:
o Public Service Commission (PSC),
o U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
o Federal Land Manager,
o U.S. Army Corp of Engineers,
o Kentucky Division for Air Quality,
o Kentucky Division of Water,
o Kentucky Division of Waste Management,
o Kentucky Division of Forestry, and
o U.S. Forest Service (USFS).

Other: It is necessary for a regulating authority or legislative body to establish standards for
low-impact, sustainably harvested biomass and ensure that biomass used as fuel to meet the
goals of this policy meets these standards.
To meet the 2025 goals set forth in the Kentucky Energy Plan, electric generation from biomass will
have to increase by nearly 12 times the amount currently generated.

F-5

The Division for Air Quality should review the NSR Program and determine strategies to allow for
the power plant efficiency improvement projects in the framework of the NSR program. In addition,
the Division for Air Quality should consult and provide technical information to EPA for
consideration to determine whether power plant efficiency projects should be exempt from NSR
permitting.

Implementation Mechanisms
Biomass Energy Development
•

Creation of the infrastructure necessary to support the procurement, transport, and utilization
of biomass.

•

Enactment of complementary policies, such as:
o A renewable portfolio standard (RPS) that ensures demand for the resource.
o Cost recovery mechanisms for utilities that burn biomass.

Power Plant Efficiency Improvements
•

Determine which improvements can be performed without triggering NSR.

•

Develop a strategy to amend the NSR regulations to allow efficiency improvements to be
made without triggering NSR.

•

Utilities should include efficiency improvements in their Integrated Resource Plans (IRPs).

•

Allow power plant efficiency improvements to count toward an efficiency portfolio standard
(EPS).

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Biomass Energy Development
•

There are tax incentives for renewable energy generators of residential, commercial, and
utility-scale systems. Additionally, the Kentucky Energy Plan provides goals for energy
efficiency and renewable energy capacity.

•

The University of Kentucky (UK) is partnering with the East Kentucky Power Cooperative
(EKPC) on a pilot project to co-fire biomass at EKPC’s circulating fluidized-bed generators.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
All measures under this policy result in a reduction in the amount of fossil fuel required to
produce a given amount of electricity, or the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of fuel consumed.
Greenhouse gases (GHGs) reduced are those associated with combustion, predominantly CO2.

Quantification Methods: In order to quantify this policy, the first step was to establish capacity
and performance characteristics (i.e., heat rate, capacity factor) for Kentucky power stations for
the latest year data were available (i.e., 2008). The next step was to establish cost and
performance assumptions for each of the supply-side efficiency improvements and biomass cofiring. Supply-side efficiency improvements were phased in linearly starting in 2012 at 10% per
year; biomass co-firing was phased in linearly starting in 2012 at 10% per year up to 4,182
gigawatt-hours (GWh). The costs and benefits of dedicated biomass combustion were based on
the available remaining supplies as calculated by the Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste (AFW)
Technical Work Group (TWG), considering both stoker and fluidized bed boiler types. Costs

F-7

were compared on the basis of levelized costs. 2 To avoid double counting of biomass GHG
reductions, the reductions from ES-1 are accounted for in ES-7, Renewable Energy Incentives
and Barrier Removal, Including CHP.
Key Assumptions
The following supply-side efficiency improvement technologies were considered:
•

Economizer

•

Neural network

•

Intelligent sootblowers

•

Air heaters

•

Acid dew point control

•

Turbine overhaul

•

Feedwater heaters

•

Boiler feed pumps

•

Induced draft (ID) axial fans and variable frequency drives

•

Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system modifications

•

Electrostatic precipitator (ESP) system modifications

•

Selective catalyst reduction (SCR) system modifications

•

Cooling tower packing upgrade

Since information was not available regarding the status of improvements that had been
undertaken at each unit/plant relative to the technologies considered in the analysis, it was
assumed that 50% of the supply-side efficiency improvements had already been installed at
Kentucky coal steam power stations, hence limiting the scope of potential GHG reductions from
the baseline. The cost and performance assumptions for the technologies noted above are
provided in Tables ES-1-2.

The biomass resource available to utilize in stand-alone facilities and the cost assumptions were
obtained from analysis conducted by the AFW TWG and are summarized in tables AFW-1 and
AFW-2 in the AFW appendix of this final report. A weighted-average cost of biomass was
assumed at $65/dry ton (rounded) over the planning period. The biomass available (i.e., less
amounts used in other sectors) for use in stoker and fluidized bed boilers was assumed to be
354,000 dry short tons per year (i.e., about 4 trillion British thermal units (Btu)/year).

Key Uncertainties
Biomass Energy Development
Key uncertainties include the issue of demand for biomass. It is uncertain what the demand for
biomass resources will be without a renewable standard, and how or if utilities will receive cost
recovery to utilize biomass. Current least-cost guidelines may deny generators PSC rate recovery
for retrofit or new biomass generation.
On January 12, 2011, EPA issued a three-year deferment on the inclusion of GHG emissions
from biogenic sources from regulation under the EPA GHG Tailoring Rule that went into effect
on January 2, 2011. While this is positive to the operational costs of projects currently utilizing
biomass feedstocks, the continued uncertainty may impact the increased utilization of biomass
feedstocks.
Power Plant Efficiency Improvements
Another uncertainty is the ability to change NSR regulations. The modeled improvements are not
additive, and some are already in place. Specific NSR requirements cannot be known without a
plant-by-plant and technology-by-technology analysis, which is beyond the scope of this study. It
cannot be determined to what degree these efficiency and biomass improvements can be installed
without amending NSR rules, although a significant number of efficiency measures that did not
trigger NSR regulatory processes have already been adopted (see below). Among some of those
that have not yet been adopted, there is likelihood that NSR is an obstacle. For the purpose of
this analysis, it is assumed that the remaining opportunities will be fully available without NSR
restrictions. Therefore, absent timely relief from NSR, these results overstate the supply-side
efficiency opportunities. Current least-cost guidelines may deny generators PSC rate recovery for
some energy efficiency retrofits.
Supply-side efficiency measures are partially implemented in the existing fleet. It is not known
precisely which measures are installed on each plant. The ES TWG estimates that approximately
50% of the potential measures studied here have already been installed, and their benefits are
already in the baseline. Therefore, the future potential for supply-side efficiency improvements is

F-11

assumed to be one-half of the system-wide potential, assuming none of the measures is installed.
A more precise estimate could be made if detailed plant-by-plant information becomes available.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Biomass Energy Development
Additional benefits include economic development opportunities if biomass resources are
developed in-state. Specifically jobs could be created to plant, harvest, transport, process, and
burn the biomass. In additional to GHGs, pollution such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) could be reduced
by utilizing biomass resources. Ratepayers may pay more per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for electricity
derived from renewables, including biomass.
Power Plant Efficiency Improvements
•

Increase energy output without increasing emissions.

•

Energy independence

•

Coal plants would stay in service longer.

An RPS or similar mechanism will be necessary to drive demand for electricity by biomass.
Without demand, supply will not materialize.

F-13

ES-3. Advanced Fossil Fuel Technology (IGCC, CCSR, Advanced
Pulverized Coal, CFB) Incentives, Support, or Requirements

Policy Description
Advanced fossil technologies for electric generation include more efficient—and thus loweremitting—generation technologies. Advanced fossil technologies combined with carbon capture
and storage or reuse (CCSR) may have the potential to significantly lower CO2 emissions
associated with fossil fuel-based electricity generation. Advanced fossil technologies that could
be considered include advanced pulverized coal (advanced supercritical or ultra-supercritical
units), integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) units, advanced circulating fluidized-bed
(CFB) technology, and advanced natural gas combined-cycle (NGCC) units.
Policies to encourage the development of these technologies may include mandates or incentives
to use advanced coal technologies for new coal plants, such as a mandate that requires new fossil
fuel-fired power plant designs that must accommodate CCSR, or must achieve a specific higher
efficiency rating or lower net CO2 emission rate. Alternatively, a mandate might require that all
or a portion of new fossil fuel plants be of a certain stage of development (e.g., most proven,
highest efficiency).
Incentives may take the form of full recovery of prudently incurred utility investments in
advanced fossil fuel technologies, direct subsidies, or assistance in financing electric generating
projects. A combination of mandates and incentives is also possible.
Policy Design
In consideration of the Kentucky’s Energy Plan’s seven strategies, which establish 2025 as a
target date, the proposed policy design elements should include:
•

Appropriate legislative action to address barriers.

•

Support for demonstration unit deployment.

•

Cost recovery and/or other incentives.

•

Adequate agency oversight.

It is important to note that all electric generation facilities must be approved by either the PSC or
Kentucky’s State Board on Electric Generation and Transmission Siting on a case-by-case basis
(excluding those built by the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA] and municipal utilities).
Goals
•

The goal of this policy is to facilitate the development of at least one advanced fossil fuel
electric generating project utilizing coal and one utilizing natural gas by 2020. In an effort to
illustrate and quantify potential cost/benefits for deploying advanced fossil fuel technology
designs, calculations from this goal are based on the replacement of the equivalent amount of
capacity of older, existing coal-fired (or natural gas) units within the state. It will be assumed

F-14

that each new plant will be 800-MW coal and 600-MW natural gas, nominally. It is
important to note that transmission capability must be assessed for any new large-generator
interconnection, as well as the impact of removing any existing generation resource.
Transmission upgrades may result in increased costs for the analyses.
•

Newly required or replacement baseload electric generation utilizing fossil fuels should be
advanced fossil fuel technology designs. These generating resources may originate from
entities filing IRPs or merchant sources.

Timing: Coincident with new or replacement baseload electric generation needs, assume 2016
deployment for the natural gas unit and 2020 for the coal unit. 4
Parties Involved: Key parties involved in implementation of this policy include the legislative
bodies from Commonwealth of Kentucky, the PSC, Kentucky’s State Board on Electric
Generation and Transmission Siting, and Kentucky energy suppliers.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Specific mechanisms that should be implemented include:
•

CCSR liability concerns should be addressed. Legislation would likely be necessary.

•

The state should encourage the development, demonstration, and deployment of at least one
advanced fossil fuel electric generating project utilizing coal and natural gas within the next
10 years. Each project should consider the appropriate application of CCSR (if the CCSR
technology is commercially proven or the proposed project provides design characteristics
for retrofitting CCSR in the future).

•

The state should ensure a cost recovery mechanism, which includes pre-approval consistent
with the current PSC process and contemporaneous cost recovery exists for the
demonstration projects.

•

In addition to established review criteria, the PSC and/or Kentucky’s State Board on Electric
Generation and Transmission Siting should review all new electric generating facilities using
fossil fuels to ensure the thermal cycle design is the most efficient (and hence the lowest
CO2-emitting design for a specified fuel) technology choice available for the proposed fossil
fuel (coal or natural gas) that has proven reliability. Legislation would likely be necessary.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Carbon Management Research Group (CMRG) will carry out a 10-year program of research
to develop and demonstrate cost-effective and practical technologies for reducing and managing
CO2 emissions in existing coal-fired electric power plants. DEDI is investigating sites to test
sequestration of locally produced CO2.

4

It typically takes at least 10 years to move a project from the concept stage to commercialization. Thus, 2020
would be the earliest the project would be in operation.

F-15

The Kentucky Geological Survey (KGS) conducted a feasibility study of carbon capture,
utilization, and sequestration in Kentucky. That study has resulted in development of projects
involving actual CO2 sequestration in a test well in Hancock County, and planning for another
test well in eastern Kentucky.
The Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC) has helped provide funds to the Center
for Applied Energy Research (CAER) to commercialize sequestration of CO2 emissions from
power plants in an algae bioreactor.
CMRG is a consortium of major power companies, the University of Kentucky, CAER, and
KEEC. CMRG will carry out a 10-year, $24-million research program to develop and
demonstrate cost-effective, practical technologies for reducing and managing CO2 in existing
coal-fired electric power plants. Three main research projects are envisioned:
•

Investigation of post-combustion CO2 control technologies using the CAER pilot plant.
CAER will complete a detailed parametric testing for the particular coal that will be fired in a
slip-stream field-testing site, and will provide the optimum operational conditions as well as
solvent management protocol.

•

Slip-stream investigation of post-combustion CO2 control technologies at a consortium
power plant. CAER will complete a portable slip-stream apparatus fabrication, installation,
and commissioning.

•

Development of chemical looping combustion/gasification for solid fuels. CAER will
complete design and fabrication of a bench-scale redox apparatus.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
All measures under this policy result in a reduction in the amount of fossil fuel required to
produce a given amount of electricity, or the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of fuel consumed.
GHGs reduced are those associated with combustion, predominantly CO2.

Quantification Methods: In order to quantify this recommendation, the first step was to
establish capacity and performance characteristics (i.e., heat rate, capacity factor) for Kentucky
power stations for the latest year data were available (i.e., 2008). The next step was to rank these
units in order of decreasing heat rates. For the coal scenarios (see description in the “Key
Assumptions” section below), the units with the highest heat rates comprising capacity of about
800 MW and 1,600 MW were assumed to be replaced with new supercritical coal units, with and
without CCS. For the natural gas scenarios, the units with the highest heat rates comprising
capacity of about 600 MW and 1,200 MW were assumed to be replaced with new NGCC units,
with and without CCS. The next step was to establish cost and performance assumptions for
existing and new units. An online year of 2020 was assumed for all scenarios. Costs were
compared on the basis of levelized cost.

F-17

Key Assumptions: Four scenarios were considered, as follows:
•

Scenario #1: Replace about 800 MW and 1,600 MW of lowest efficiency with supercritical
coal without CCS.

•

Scenario #2: Replace about 600 MW and 1,200 MW of lowest efficiency with conventional
NGCC without CCS.

•

Scenario #3: Replace about 800 MW and 1,600 MW of lowest efficiency with supercritical
coal with CCS.

•

Scenario #4: Replace about 600 MW and 1,200 MW of lowest efficiency with advanced
NGCC with CCS.

NGCC. The orange-shaded cells correspond to the 800 MW (actually 781 MW modeled) and
1,600 MW (actually 1,753 MW modeled) scenarios; the yellow-shaded rows correspond to the

Key Uncertainties
•

State of the technology and costs of capture and storage alternatives.

•

Approvals of the necessary certificates for regulated or non-regulated entities. Consideration
for approval of a supply-side resource that may not be the least-cost alternative at the time of
implementation.

•

Legal uncertainties for carbon sequestration, including permitting, pore space ownership,
property, and mineral rights issues.

•

Detailed understanding of the geologic formations across the state and suitability for longterm storage with commensurate liability considerations.

•

Ability to gain approvals for this resource in the event a federal or state renewable energy
standard is mandated.

Additional Benefits and Costs
•

Replacement of older technology will reduce emissions while preserving the utilization of
key natural resources that are abundantly available in the state.

•

Creation of construction employment opportunities and preservation of full-time employment
at the selected site(s) for the advanced fossil-fuel technology and the mining or natural gas
industries.

•

As indicated previously, this advanced fossil fuel supply-side resource may not be the leastcost alternative at the time of implementation.

Feasibility Issues
Additional supply-side resources must receive approval from the regulatory bodies in the state,
based on a case-by-case demonstrated need. Gaining the environmental permits presents
significant obstacles that must be overcome, particularly in the carbon sequestration arena.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Unanimous, with one abstention.
Barriers to Consensus

ES-4. CCSR Enabling Policies, R&D, Infrastructure, and Incentives,
Including Enhanced Oil Recovery Using CO2

Policy Description
Fossil fuels are the primary fuel for electricity generation in Kentucky and in the United States,
and will remain so, according to EIA’s latest AEO projections. 7 For fossil fuels to operate in a
GHG-constrained world, the capture of CO2 from natural gas- and coal-fueled power plants, and
the successful storage or utilization (in a manner permanently preventing its entry into the
atmosphere or oceans) of that carbon are necessary. Steps to encourage the development of
carbon capture, storage and utilization require a multi-pronged approach.
The Commonwealth has partnered with private utilities and federal agencies in investments in
the study of carbon capture technology development at existing power plants. This is one piece
of the puzzle. The further characterization of the capacity of the geology in Kentucky to
successfully store carbon after capture is also a necessary investment. Kentucky has funded
several successful projects to date, but more is needed to be done to facilitate large-scale storage
by private entities. The legal and regulatory issues involved around CCS also have to be
addressed.
For the purpose of this policy, “utilization” is assumed to mean enhanced oil and gas recovery,
and algae fuel development. Utilization of CO2 for these purposes and other uses has been
funded in part, but more work needs to be done in this area as well. Generators of CO2 may not
be located near areas with adequate storage or utilization potential, so transportation issues
involved with intrastate and interstate pipelines must also be addressed.
Policy Design
•

Develop policy recommendations that address the intrastate and interstate legal and
regulatory issues concerning CO2 storage and transportation.

•

Develop funding mechanisms to scale up the carbon capture research presently being done in
order to prove feasibility at a larger scale.

•

Develop a proposal for a demonstration plant for the integration of a commercialized capture
retrofit project for potential federal funding.

•

Develop funding mechanisms that will facilitate the further evaluation of carbon storage and
utilization potential in the Commonwealth. The policy should address the impacts on
efficiency if CCSR technology is applied to existing units, as there will be an associated loss
of capacity from those units (parasitic load increases).

Quantification Methods: In order to quantify this policy, the first step was to establish capacity
and performance characteristics (i.e., heat rate, capacity factor) for potential Kentucky power
stations to be retrofitted. A 250-MW pulverized coal station of average efficiency was assumed
to be retrofitted with CCS, using power plant data from the latest year available (i.e., 2008). The

F-23

next step was to establish cost and performance assumptions for retrofitting. An online year of
2018 was assumed. Costs were compared on the basis of levelized cost.
Key Assumptions: The key assumptions for the capacity to be retrofitted with CCS are
summarized as follows:
•

Retrofit 250-MW coal station (average efficiency) with CCS.

•

90% carbon capture.

•

Capacity penalty: 16%.

•

Energy penalty: 33%.

•

Incremental capital cost: $1,400/kilowatt (kW).

•

Total incremental cost: $71.2/MWh (capital, fixed O&M, variable O&M, fuel) based on a
capital recovery factor of 0.115. 8

Key Uncertainties
•

Cost recovery for CCS projects by utilities will likely not be allowed until there are
requirements at the federal level. This delays implementation of these projects.

•

The feasibility of large-scale integrated retrofit of an existing power plant has not been
demonstrated.

•

The price of CCSR at the scale needed to impact the GHG footprint of existing facilities is
expected to be high, but must be demonstrated to be feasible without jeopardizing reliability.

•

The cost of capture technology and the energy penalty associated with capture may be
prohibitive at this time.

•

Kentucky has many power plants near state borders. There is no clear indication of how
interstate movement of CO2 in a storage field would be addressed, with differing property
rights delineation in each state.

Additional Benefits and Costs
The infrastructure needed to move CO2 from sources to storage or utilization is significant. No
existing pipelines exist and would have to be built at significant cost.
Feasibility Issues
•

The cost of CCSR without a mandate would likely not be borne by utilities at this time,
because of lack of cost recovery.

•

Interstate issues of CO2 geologic storage must be dealt with by interstate compacts or federal
action.

•

Public acceptance of CO2 pipelines or injection has been an issue in other states.

The capital recovery factor of 0.115 was obtained using a range of assumptions about debt/equity ratio, corporate
tax level, and other variables. See Annex 2.

ES-5. Pricing Strategies to Promote Efficiency and Renewables,
Including Net Metering, Feed-In Tariff, Interconnection Rules,
Inclined Rates, and Examination of the Standard Rate Structure

Policy Description
Pricing Strategies
Pricing strategies can be used to encourage energy efficiency, conservation and demand
response. Such strategies can take many forms and are best implemented by individual utilities
working in concert with regulatory bodies to best address the needs of its particular customer
group.
Pricing strategies can reduce GHGs in two ways. The first is to encourage conservation. Some
pricing mechanisms encourage utilities to facilitate their customers’ reduction in consumption,
while others encourage customers to reduce consumption directly. Often, a single mechanism
cannot encourage both the utility and customer to conserve. The second approach is to reduce
peak loads so that more efficient generation and delivery infrastructure can be utilized.
Opportunities exist for utilities to employ more sophisticated rate structures than have been
available in the past due to advanced metering. Nevertheless, it must be recognized that such rate
structures require advanced metering with a higher cost and necessitates aggressive customer
education and acceptance, and the recovery of these costs through customer charges must be
allowed by the regulatory agency.
Inclining Block Rates
Inclining block rates as they refer to energy charges are mainly employed for smaller consumers,
residential and general service, where the customer group is fairly homogenous and only basic
kWh metering is available. For inclining block rates to be effective in encouraging energy
efficiency, conservation, or demand response, the higher-use blocks must be significantly more
expensive, and at that level may not be cost-based. This can have an adverse economic impact on
low-income customers, who often lack the resources to reduce consumption by replacing energyconsuming devices with high-efficiency units, or by modifying housing to promote energy
efficiency, conservation, or demand response.
Flat Block Rates
Flat block rates as they refer to energy charges are mainly employed for smaller consumers,
residential and general service, where the customer group is fairly homogenous and only basic
kWh metering is available. This rate design utilizes only a customer charge and energy charge
with the fixed demand component bundled within the energy charge at an average load factor.
Although a better alignment of costs with pricing, flat block rates offer no incentive for the
customer to modify consumption patterns by either improving efficiency or conserving energy.
This rate structure is not well suited to promote energy efficiency, conservation, or demand

F-26

response unless used as a transitional rate to a more effective time-of-day rate, or when
combined with a demand charge.
Time-of-Day Rates
Time-of-day rates are currently directed at larger customers because of the historically higher
cost of the required metering. However, with the availability of advanced metering at lower
prices, this rate structure may be appropriate for use by a larger number of customers. Customers
will have the flexibility to modify consumption patterns, reducing both their cost and their
contribution to system peaks with a customer charge, a flat energy charge, and a demand charge
divided into appropriate tiers.
This pricing structure is the most advantageous for all types of customers in aligning price with
cost, sending the appropriate signal to the customer, and modifying consumption patterns to
maximize system efficiency and conservation. Time-of-day rates primarily promote demand
response (decrease peak demand). When combined with an aggressive and robust customer
education plan, they can also promote energy efficiency and conservation. Such plans should
involve all stakeholder groups and include innovative tools for customers to manage their energy
use.
To date, these tools are in the development stage; consequently, the use of alternative transitional
rate structures may be helpful while the utility is developing the educational information and
tools to assist the customer in taking full advantage of time-of-day rate structures. Critical peak
pricing may also be effectively combined with traditional time-of-day rates to possibly deliver an
excellent cost-based price signal to encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and demand
response.
Real-Time Rates
Real-time rates require advanced metering and communication with the customer, with real-time
price signals on a real-time basis of minutes, hours, or next day. Directed at larger customers
because of the sophistication needed to monitor the pricing and react operationally, they have not
been readily accepted by customers. Typically, electric energy billings account for a relatively
small portion of commercial/industrial total expenses; hence, customers do not believe the
proposed savings justify the effort. While the rate structure is appropriate for large customers, it
is not recommended, since customer acceptance is low.
Fixed-Cost Recovery Rates
Fixed-cost recovery rates may take several forms, and are dependent on the proper classification
of fixed and variable costs into customer, energy, and demand components. Properly identifying
fixed and variable costs and assigning them to the customer classes as customer, energy, or
capacity is the starting point. Whatever rate design is chosen and approved by the PSC, it should
then follow cost-of-service rates as closely as possible. Customer charges must fully reflect
customer cost. Energy charges must be limited as nearly as possible to only reflecting variable
cost. Fixed-cost recovery rates can be used very effectively to transition to time of-use rates
described above.

F-27

Seasonal Differentials and Power Factor Recognition
Other rate considerations include seasonal differentials and power factor recognition. Seasonal
differentials are useful in assigning cost, but have little impact on consumption patterns unless
used in conjunction with other techniques, such as time-of-day pricing. Power factor recognition,
either through kW correction or kilovolt-ampere (kVA) billing, is vital for providing larger
customers an accurate price signal.
All rate designs have strengths and weaknesses, and their effectiveness depends upon the
characteristics of the rate class to which the rate is being applied. Time-of-day rates are the most
appropriate rate to promote energy efficiency, conservation, and demand response, and are
recommended when combined with an aggressive and robust customer education plan, involving
all stakeholder groups and innovative tools for the customer to manage their energy use. In order
to manage customer satisfaction and transition to effective energy efficiency rates, it is
recommended that a menu of rate options be available to utilities and the PSC as utilities
transition from traditional rate structures to more innovative time-of-use rate structures.
Interconnection Rules and Net Metering
The purpose of interconnection rules and net metering policies is to facilitate the cost-effective
interconnection of renewable or distributed energy resources onto the power grid, supporting the
expansion of the supply of renewable electricity.
The development of renewable energy sources is one of many avenues that should be considered
toward the goal of reducing GHG emissions. The rules for interconnecting new renewable power
generators onto the electricity grid can be a hindrance to, supportive of, or neutral to the
development of these new generators.
Net metering is an important aspect of interconnection, which has played a critical role in the
development of distributed renewable energy. Under net metering, the retail electricity supplier
credits renewable power supplied to the grid by an eligible generator. This credit may be crucial
to the financial viability of most renewable electricity projects. A net metering law may establish
a standard procedure for interconnecting renewable energy systems, thereby removing
significant administrative barriers.
It should be noted that net metering is distinctly different from the Qualifying Facilities rules,
which govern the interconnection of facilities intending to sell power to the grid. The distinction
is important, because net metering exists to serve facilities aiming to meet some or all of their
annual electricity demand, rather than those built for the purpose of selling power.
Interconnection under net metering is more financially attractive to the customer-generator than
the Qualifying Facilities tariffs. Under net metering, the customer’s renewable generation is
credited at the retail rate. Under Qualifying Facilities, the generator is paid the avoided cost rate,
which is less than the retail rate, making net metering a more favorable policy for renewables.
It should also be noted that numerous organizations dedicated to advancing the deployment of
renewables have identified net metering and supporting interconnection standards as key
facilitating policies. These include (but are not limited to) the Interstate Renewable Energy
Council, the Solar Energy Industries Association, and DOE.
F-28

Feed-In Tariff
A feed-in tariff (FIT) establishes rates for renewable power and mandates electric utilities to
purchase that renewable power under long-term contracts at these above-market rates. FITs are
also known as “production-based incentives,” because the payments are based on the amount of
electricity generated by the facility and recorded on a meter. Many incentive programs, such as
tax credits and rebates, pay people for purchasing and installing equipment, but there is no
verification that the systems actually generate power. Under FITs, payments are only made for
electricity generated onto the grid.
Policy Design
Pricing Strategies
Goals: The goal is to implement time-of-day rates consistent with the timing of ES-2 and ES-11.
Modification of consumption patterns resulting in increased system efficiency may be measured
through decreased system peaks, increased system load factors, and increased system power
factors. Even without a reduction in kWh sales, these impacts may result in a reduction of GHGs,
since transmission/distribution losses are related to load exponentially.
Timing: Time-of-day rates should be implemented consistent with the timing of RCI-3 and
ES-11.
Parties Involved: Utilities, PSC, Attorney General, customers, community action groups, and
other interested parties.
Other: Effective implementation of time-of-day rates depends upon the use of advanced
metering infrastructure (AMI) and smart grid technologies recommended in RCI-3 and ES-11.
Interconnection Rules and Net Metering
Goals: The goal of this policy is to establish effective net metering and interconnection rules to
facilitate the connection of renewable or distributed energy resources to the grid.
Net metering improvements should be based on the following:
•

Change the cap on the size of eligible systems. This will enable large industrial and
commercial customers to participate in net metering.

•

Adjust the cap on the aggregate total of net metering generation from 1% to 5% of peak
demand for each utility.

•

Allow third-party ownership of systems eligible for net metering. This will enable customers
to lease renewable energy equipment or enter into power purchase agreements for the
purchase of renewable power and utilize net metering.

•

Allow utility ownership of renewable DG, storage solutions, and/or energy conservation
devices “behind” the customer meter, with recovery equal to the cost of new generation
capacity.

F-29

Timing: The measures to amend the net metering guidelines should be considered by the
Kentucky legislature in 2012. For the purpose of analysis, assume the necessary legislation is in
place by July 2012.
Parties Involved: Kentucky retail electric suppliers and their customers, renewable energy
companies, environmental groups, Attorney General, PSC.
Other: None identified.
Feed-in Tariff
A Kentucky FIT should apply to the following renewable energy technologies: solar, wind, lowimpact biomass/biogas, and hydroelectric. The rates paid to renewable energy producers would
be established by the PSC for each technology, and would be based on the total cost for
generating the power, allowing a reasonable payback period. Utilities would be mandated to
purchase power from any renewable energy generator within the state who meets the technical
requirements. Residential and small commercial systems would all be eligible to participate.
FITs would be established for each eligible technology, and different rates would be allowable
within a class of technology based on size or other factors, where the PSC finds that these
differences significantly affect the cost of generating power.
Every two years, the PSC would review the tariffs for each technology and adjust the rates and
interconnection guidelines as appropriate. The amount paid for the renewable power would be
recovered by the utilities through a surcharge on the customer’s monthly bill.
The rates established by the PSC would be binding on municipal utilities, but not on TVA
distributors.
Goals: Consistent with strategy 2 of the Kentucky Energy Plan, the FIT would be structured to
contribute 5% of Kentucky’s total generation in 2025.
Timing: For the purpose of analysis, assume the necessary legislation is in place by July 2012,
and the PSC will establish an administrative case to set the guidelines for the FIT within 180
days of the enactment of FIT legislation.
Parties involved: Electric utilities, industrial customers, Attorney General, renewable energy
companies, environmental and public interest organizations.
Implementation Mechanisms
Interconnection Rules and Net Metering
Modification of the state’s interconnection and net metering rules as described here would
require an act of the legislature. The recommended language would specify raising the capacity
limit for eligible systems and direct the PSC to open a case to amend the state’s net metering and
interconnection standards.

F-30

Feed-in Tariff
A FIT would be implemented through an act of the legislature. The recommended language
would ideally define the broad principles of the FIT and direct the PSC to define the specific
parameters of the policy. To achieve full statewide implementation, the FIT would also have to
be implemented by TVA for its service territory within Kentucky.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Utilities are required to allow net metering of electricity up to 30 kW and only up to the
customer's usage.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
This policy encourages the replacement of fossil-fired generation with renewables. Therefore,
the GHGs reduced are those associated with combustion, principally CO2 and NOx.

Data Sources
•

FIT levels (cents/kWh) from direct TWG input based on Ontario FIT experience

•

FIT renewable generation levels from Council input obtained during Council Meeting #6.

•

BAU renewable generation based on the Kentucky ES GHG I&F.

Quantification Methods: The quantification of this policy focused on the FIT. It was premised
on the notion that the underlying goal is expressed in strategies 2 and 3 in Kentucky’s Energy
Plan, which involved obtaining 25% of Kentucky energy from renewables and energy efficiency
by 2025. The Energy Plan proposes that 18% will be provided by energy efficiency measures as
identified by the RCI TWG, 2% will be offered by biofuels policies as identified by the
Transportation and Land Use (TLU) TWG, and the remaining 5% will be provided by renewable
generation. To quantify this policy, the first step was to establish the FIT levels. For solar
photovoltaics (PV), $0.42/kWh was assumed; for other renewables, $0.10/kWh was assumed.
This policy does not advocate carve-outs, but for the purpose of quantification, the next step was
to establish any carve-outs for particular resources. A 5% carve-out was assumed for solar PV;
that is, 5% of 5%, or 0.25% of the total generation. The next step was to establish incremental
renewable generation levels (see the Key Assumptions section below). Costs were compared on

F-31

the basis of levelized costs 9 between the generation resources displaced in the BAU scenario and
the replacement renewable generation through the FIT.
Given that the FIT is analyzed as a component of the 25% Renewable and Energy Efficiency
Plan goal, this analysis assumes that the FIT and the other policy components (RCI-3 and TLU10) are implemented as a group.
Key Assumptions: The incremental renewable generation levels are summarized in Table 5-2.
“Non-solar PV renewables” refers to renewable generation other than solar PV that would be
introduced as a result of the FIT (i.e., in-state wind, landfill gas, conventional hydro, run-of-river
hydro, biomass). 10 It was assumed that coal-fired generation would be displaced by these levels.

10

Based upon the biomass availability assessment shown in table AFW-2, and assuming biomass contributes 100%
of the non-solar PV renewables in ES-5, there is sufficient biomass in Kentucky to meet all ES demands (ES-1, ES7, and ES-5) for all years, except for 2021, 2022, and 2030. In 2021, the expected shortfall is 0.8 million dry tons of
biomass, in 2022 it is 0.5 million dry tons, and in 2030 it is 0.1 million dry tons. Since non-solar PV renewables
includes resources other than biomass, the ES-5 generation target can be achieved in all years without violating
constraints on biomass availability.

Key Uncertainties
Interconnection Rules and Net Metering
Implementation of these policy changes are straightforward and follow the path many other
states have already taken. There are no significant uncertainties affecting the implementation of
these policies.
Feed-in Tariff
In 2010, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published a report examining the
question of potential legal barriers to the implementation of FITs in the United States. Federal
PURPA law limits the ability of utilities to pay above wholesale rates for electric supplies. The
NREL report pointed to a number of strategies whereby FITs can be implemented without
challenging these federal laws. These legal issues remain a significant uncertainty for FIT
policies in the United States. As many states and jurisdictions are pursuing FIT policies, there are
many people seeking to resolve these uncertainties. In 2010, NREL published a policymaker’s
guide to FITs, which addresses this issue, as well. 11
Additional Benefits and Costs
Interconnection rules and net metering supporting the expanded use of renewable energy will
result in economic development in the renewable energy sector.
FIT policies have been documented to stimulate dramatic increases in investment in renewable
energy infrastructure in regions that have implemented them. This has resulted in substantial
increases in related employment. FITs would also ensure within-state development of renewable
energy and DG, which brings numerous societal benefits. This contrasts with other policies, such
as an RPS, which may not necessarily promote in-state development of renewables at the same
scale.

Feasibility Issues
Interconnection Rules and Net Metering
Implementation of these policy changes are straightforward and follow the path many other
states have already taken. There are no technical barriers affecting the feasibility of these actions.
Feed-in Tariff
The feasibility of FIT policies being successfully implemented hinges on the answers to how to
craft a FIT policy that would fit within the legal limits of federal law, and what the ability of the
Kentucky General Assembly is to pass FIT legislation within the current political climate.
Opponents to FIT policy may argue that it could raise the price of electricity, and members of the
General Assembly may be adverse to this potential outcome.
This analysis projects the cost and effectiveness of these policy recommendations applied
throughout the Commonwealth, including the regions served by TVA. TVA is not under the
jurisdiction of the PSC or the Kentucky Legislature, Therefore, to achieve the full benefits of
these policies, TVA and its distributors would have to adopt the same or similar policies and
apply them in their Kentucky service territory.

ES-6. New Nuclear Energy Capacity

Policy Description
Nuclear power has historically been a low-GHG source of electricity. However, no new
commercial reactor has come on line in the United Sates since 1996, due to high capital costs,
the absence of a repository or technology for permanent disposal of nuclear waste, and pubic
concerns for safety. The federal government has been supportive of nuclear expansion,
emphasizing its importance in maintaining a diverse energy supply and its reputation for
producing electricity with negligible pollutant emissions during operation. Congress has also
offered significant financial subsidies for new nuclear plants, in an effort to jump-start the
industry.
Steps to encourage nuclear power options in the state would have to begin with the removal of
the statutory ban against constructing a nuclear plant in Kentucky (KRS 278-605 and 610). Steps
could also include providing a streamlined siting review and streamlined appeals process and
enacting policies to reduce the risk to capital. The state could serve as a facilitator in developing
a new nuclear facility, recognizing the cost and financing burdens such a facility could impose
on existing state companies. Small-scale nuclear options could also be considered.
Policy Design
Develop policy recommendations to encourage the licensing and construction of baseload
nuclear power plants in Kentucky. State-level legislative and regulatory approaches are needed
to overcome barriers and facilitate construction of new nuclear plants.
Goals: Install 2,000 MW of nuclear generation in Kentucky.
Timing: Remove barriers and improve regulatory approaches in 2012, and install baseload
operating units by 2025. 12
Parties Involved: Kentucky General Assembly, PSC, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),
KEEC, regulated utilities, municipal utilities, TVA, and energy company consortia.
Other: Promote programs to develop job opportunities in the construction and operation of
nuclear units.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

For this policy to be implemented, the statutory ban on construction of a nuclear power plant
would need to be removed during the 2012 session of the General Assembly.

•

DEDI should support the siting of potential nuclear power plants in compliance with NRC
requirements and maintain a list of potential sites.

12

As noted under Key Uncertainties, the lead time required for siting, design, permitting, and construction of a new
nuclear generation facility could be longer than the date proposed here.
F-35

•

DEDI or other appropriate state agency should develop an effective and consistent oversight
program that could include permitting consistent with federal timelines, providing needed
infrastructure, and working with local communities and interest groups to ensure the
potential concerns are identified early and that involved parties are fully informed of the
considerations for siting and operations.

•

State utilities should incorporate the nuclear power option into the IRP process for selection
of new generating unit types. Small or modular nuclear reactor designs should be considered,
as well as gigawatt-scale reactors.

•

The state should create a program of incentives that reduce the risk of capitalizing and
financing new nuclear power plants that include rate recovery of a portion of construction
costs prior to operation (construction work in progress), and tax incentives.

•

The state should develop and implement a public engagement plan to gather and address
stakeholder feedback and concerns.

•

The state should work with vocation training institutes in Kentucky to ensure that trained
personnel are available to staff the construction and operation of nuclear power plants and
work with state universities to support the nuclear engineering and related degreed fields
necessary to support nuclear generation.

•

Energy companies should consider joint ownership of nuclear generators.

•

Companies or organizations that are considering nuclear power should be approached about
locating in Kentucky.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
DEDI has published the Kentucky Alternative Energy Site Bank Evaluation. It evaluated 41
industrial sites in Kentucky for suitability of various energy projects, including nuclear
generation (http://energy.ky.gov/Documents/2009FinalReportSiteBankIII.pdf).
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Nuclear generation would displace fossil generation. GHGs reduced are those associated with
combustion, predominantly CO2 and NOx.

Quantification Methods: To quantify this policy, the first step was to establish capacity and
performance characteristics (i.e., heat rate, capacity factor) for Kentucky power stations for the
latest year data for which were available (i.e., 2008). The next step was to rank these units in
order of decreasing heat rates. The units with the highest heat rates comprising capacity of about
2,000 MW were assumed to be replaced with a new nuclear power station. The next step was to
establish cost and performance assumptions for existing and new units. An online year of 2025
was assumed. Costs were compared on the basis of levelized cost relative to three different cost
estimates.
The ES TWG recognizes that the costs for nuclear plant construction in the United States have
historically experienced significant overruns driven by delays and financing charges. However,
for consistency across baseload ES policies (including ES-3), the nuclear cost assumptions for
ES-6 have been taken from a study performed by R.W. Beck and SAIC for EIA in June 2010 and
adjusted based on AEO 2011 assumptions.
Key Assumptions: It was assumed that the nameplate capacity of the nuclear power plant is
2,000 MW. Table ES-6-2 summarizes the capacity to be replaced by the new nuclear power
plant. The orange-shaded cells correspond to the characteristics of the capacity modeled.

•

Whether the proposed operational date of 2025 can be achieved, given the lead time needed
for design, siting, permitting, construction, etc.

•

The ability to remove the Kentucky statutory prohibition against nuclear construction prior to
a permanent federal nuclear waste repository (KRS 278.605).

•

The level of public opposition to nuclear power historically evident in coal states.

•

The ES TWG recognizes that the costs for nuclear plant construction in the United States
have historically experienced significant overruns driven by delays and financing charges.
However, for consistency across baseload ES policies (including ES-3), the nuclear cost
assumptions for ES-6 have been taken from AEO 2011.

Additional Benefits and Costs
•

Replacement of older technology will reduce emissions.

•

Creation of construction employment opportunities and preservation of full-time employment
at the selected site(s).

•

Nuclear power can provide large amounts of baseload power with high capacity factors—
85%–95%—with minimal CO2 emissions.

•

The potential need for Kentucky to develop and license an in-state low-level waste disposal
facility to manage the increased volume of these wastes might increase the cost of this policy.

Feasibility Issues
•

Additional supply-side resources must receive approval from the regulatory bodies in the
state based on a case-by-case demonstrated need. Gaining the environmental permits presents
significant obstacles that must be overcome.

•

Availability of capital to build a gigawatt-class nuclear unit.

•

Questionable public acceptance of new nuclear generation facilities.

Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Majority, with one abstention and four objections.
Barriers to Consensus
The members opposed to this policy stated that they believe the cost represented by the analysis
is unrealistically low. Objectors argued that cost overruns have always been a major part of
constructing nuclear power plants in North America, with the average cost overrun being 207%.
Two objectors also preferred to mention that this resource may not be the least-cost alternative at
the time of this policy’s implementation. The majority disagreed and chose not to include this
language on the basis that this same statement would apply to all ES policies, not just ES-6.

ES-7. Renewable Energy Incentives and Barrier Removal, Including CHP

Policy Description
Renewable Portfolio Standard
Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) require utilities to meet a portion of their electricity
demand with electricity generated with renewable resources. Twenty-nine states and the District
of Columbia have enacted some form of portfolio standard. Kentucky’s Energy Plan sets a target
of 16% efficiency and 1000 MW of renewable electricity by 2025.
An RPS, with an energy efficiency component, will mandate the use of renewable sources of
electricity and may stimulate energy efficiency programs. It is extremely difficult to increase the
use of renewable electricity to the state energy profile without a legislative mandate. The cost of
generating electricity from renewable resources is typically higher than from conventional
resources, such as coal. The levelized energy cost (LEC) of a coal-fired power plant may be as
low as $.03/kWh, whereas the LEC for solar electricity could be as high as $0.30/kwh. This is
important, because the PSC must approve the procurement of renewable electricity and cost
recovery for utilities within its jurisdiction. If a utility can generate or purchase the electricity at
a lower cost, the PSC must approve the acquisition of electricity above this cost.
RPS policies vary across the states that have adopted them, and Kentucky should review its own
renewable opportunities and craft an RPS that best suits the state. For example, Kentucky’s
Energy Plan cited that residential electricity use was 24% above the national average in 2006.
The opportunity exists to use electricity more efficiently. A Kentucky portfolio standard could
incorporate efficiency mandates. Additionally, the Executive Task Force on Biomass and Biofuel
Development determined that Kentucky has an opportunity to meet a percentage of energy
demand with biomass, and can develop energy crops and a supply chain that will facilitate their
development and use.
Additionally, a policy should not discourage distributed sources of renewable electricity, because
such sources can provide benefits. Distributing solar energy throughout a region that has
adequate sun could reduce the demand for electricity at the source. Distributed renewable
systems can sometimes use existing transmission and distribution (T&D) lines. A Kentucky
portfolio standard should allow for deployment of distributed sources of renewable electricity.
In addition to establishing demand for renewable electricity through a portfolio standard,
Kentucky should consider support for locally or at least regionally supplied renewable resources.
Since Kentucky has significant potential to grow biomass for energy, policies could be derived
that ensure supply is available to meet the standard set by the legislature. A portfolio standard is
just one part of the equation; supply must also develop.

Hydroelectric Development
Licensing and siting barriers are associated with the development of hydroelectric power plants.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing can take 2–5 years. Siting is specific
to the resource and the availability of dams, since constructing new dams is controversial.
Kentucky currently has 783 MW of installed hydroelectric capacity in the state. According to the
Hydroelectric Assessment prepared by Idaho National Laboratory, Kentucky has a potential of
approximately 900 MW. Within this potential is approximately 265 MW of power associated
with facilities already under construction, and 42 MW of power associated with sites that are not
already dammed.
It is possible to address the economic barrier that exists. Currently IEIA already includes
hydroelectric facilities as eligible projects for tax incentives, provided they generate 1 MW of
power or more and incur a $1 million investment.
New hydro capacity and improvements to existing hydro plants that result in added capacity
should qualify as a renewable energy resource under a state portfolio standard.
Combined Heat and Power
Combined heat and power (CHP) and waste heat recovery are systems that enable a consumer to
make better use of waste heat or thermal energy associated with industrial processes or power
production. Several barriers exist to increasing these systems. One of the biggest barriers is the
spark spread, which is the difference between the cost of fuel for the CHP system to produce
power and heat on site and the offset cost of purchased grid power. A second barrier is the use of
standby charges, which are set to reflect the costs associated with generating the electricity if a
CHP system fails to generate its agreed-upon amount of electricity.
Barrier Removal
The large-scale development (1 MW and greater) of grid-based and distributed renewable energy
resources could offer benefits and opportunities for Kentucky.
Financial, educational, and regulatory barriers exist to the large-scale development of renewable
energy resources in Kentucky. Effective policies are needed to remove these barriers and provide
adequate incentives.
Financial Barriers
Renewable technologies entail high capital costs, but for some (wind, solar, hydro), no recurring
fuel costs. Financial incentives are needed to offset the low cost of the current conventional
energy system and to provide to the investor the financial return necessary to invest in the higher
capital costs of renewable technologies.
On a per unit of electricity basis, renewable electricity typically costs more than electricity
generated from existing coal plants in Kentucky. Environmental regulation and energy policy
(such as taxing carbon) could increase the cost of power from those plants, but it will take a
substantial increase to make some forms of distributed renewable electricity cost-effective.

F-41

Other financial barriers are the up-front cost of large-scale, distributed renewable electricity
systems and the cost to finance those systems.
Specifically related to solar power, a financing model—the Third-Party Partnership Model—was
developed to address these barriers and to efficiently use federal tax credits available for solar
power. An entity, such as a school, hosts a large solar system (500 kW-1 MW) and purchases the
electricity from that system. A solar developer serves as the broker and receives the solar
renewable electricity credits that are sold. The third party provides the upfront capital, and in
return receives income from the electricity sales and reduced tax liability associated with the
renewable energy tax credits.
Implementing this model is difficult, since regulated electric utilities have the exclusive right to
sell power in their service territory. The host may, therefore, be required to purchase electricity
from the utility that serves its area, and not from the solar project. This barrier could be removed
by allowing a host to purchase the renewable electricity up to a specific system size. This
financing model is especially important when financing distributed energy projects for entities
without tax liability, such as schools.
Educational Barriers
There is a great need of education among the public and decision makers about renewable energy
and its availability in Kentucky. The large-scale development of distributed renewable energy
must engage a much larger segment of the population in the generation of power than is
presently the case. A broad, intensive, and long-term educational campaign is needed to educate
the citizenry about energy fundamentals and renewable energy.
Regional Renewable Energy Planning Group
Kentucky presently has very little renewable energy generation, and the question of the state’s
true potential for generating renewable power remains a subject of debate. Each state has its own
unique, local resources (natural, human, infrastructural, economic) and its own particular needs.
A Regional Renewable Energy Planning Group would invite each of Kentucky’s neighboring
states (and perhaps others from the region) to work together to find opportunities to solve
common problems, to share resources and knowledge, and to cooperate in the common goals of
cutting GHG emissions and developing a thriving renewable energy economy.
Policy Design
Renewable Portfolio Standard
Goals: Enact a portfolio standard that incorporates efficiency and renewable electricity
resources.
•

The standard would require sellers of electricity to obtain the following percentages of
electricity from renewable energy resources or from energy efficiency improvements:
o 2011–2013: 3%
o 2014–2016: 6%
o 2017–2018: 9%

F-42

o 2019–2020: 12%
o 2021–2039: 15%
Timing: For the purpose of analysis, assume the necessary legislation is in place by July 2011.
This policy, along with policies that ensure local supply of renewable resources, must be timed
to coincide in such a way that the local resource is available to meet the standard at each
benchmark year. If local resources are not available, renewable electricity will likely be
purchased from other states.
Parties Involved: PSC, customers, energy developers, energy auditors and contractors, existing
hydroelectric permit holders, potential hydroelectric developers, utilities, Cabinet for Economic
Development, the CAER at the University of Kentucky, consumers with CHP or waste heat
recovery systems.
Other
•

Hydroelectric Generation—Properly define hydroelectric resources within the state portfolio
standard to ensure efficiency improvements that increase capacity are included, despite the
fact that changes are being made to an existing plant.

•

CHP—Properly define CHP and waste heat recovery within the state portfolio standard to
ensure that the systems could contribute to a utility’s compliance with any part of the
standard (efficiency, renewable—if powered by a renewable resource).

Barrier Removal
Goals: Three strategies are called for to address the barriers described above.
•

RPS or FITs—The establishment of either an RPS or FITs has been found to be a mechanism
for promoting the development of renewable energy.

•

Third-Party Partnership Model—Enable the benefits of the Third-Party Partnership Model
for distributed renewable energy systems by allowing the host entity to purchase the
generation from on-site systems.

•

Renewable Energy Education Program—A well-funded, long-term statewide education
program needs to be developed to educate the general population and decision makers about
energy fundamentals and renewable energy. This program would also address conservation
and energy efficiency and enable customers to better understand where their energy comes
from, what their options are for using less energy and lowering energy costs, and how to
become renewable energy generators. This program could be funded by a systems benefit
charge (SBC).

Timing: For the purpose of analysis, assume the necessary legislation is in place by July 2011.
Parties Involved: These policies would be implemented through an act of the legislature.
Electric utilities, PSC, Center for Renewable Energy Research and Environmental Stewardship
(CRERES), the Conn Center at the University of Louisville (which manages CRERES), the
CAER at UK, Attorney General, Kentucky’s industrial and manufacturers’ associations (they
F-43

would have positions on any changes to the PSC and creation of the SBC and the FIT),
renewable energy businesses, environmental and public interest organizations. All energy
consumers, including residential, low-income, seniors, commercial, and industrial.
Other: None identified.
Regional Renewable Energy Planning Group
•

Identify opportunities for interstate collaboration to meet needs for renewable energy and
GHG emission reduction.

•

Identify barriers to transmission of renewable power across the region (and into/out of
Kentucky) (FERC issue).

•

Identify opportunities for sharing the economic benefits and costs of renewable energy
development.

•

Develop solutions to common problems related to renewable energy development and GHG
emission reductions.

Goals: This sub-policy does not have specific quantifiable goals at this point.
Timing: The Regional Renewable Energy Planning Group would be initiated in 2011, and would
continue meeting so long as its activities were fruitful.
Parties Involved
•

States invited would include Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, North
Carolina, Virginia, and West Virginia.

•

DEDI personnel (Renewable Energy staff).

•

Representatives from electric utilities, local and regional renewable energy businesses.

•

Local and regional environmental and public interest organizations.

•

Energy consumer organizations, the Attorney General, Kentucky Industrial Utilities
Customers, etc.

•

Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
This type of policy would need to be established in statute by the General Assembly.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
There are complementary policies in place, such as the net metering law that allows owners of
renewable energy systems to pay for the difference between the electricity they generate and the
electricity they produce. There are also incentives for renewable energy generators of residential,

F-44

commercial, and utility-scale systems. Additionally, Kentucky’s Energy Plan provides goals for
energy efficiency and renewable energy capacity.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Renewable energy incentives seek to displace fossil generation with renewables. GHG
reductions are the products of combustion, principally CO2 and NOx.

Quantification Methods: In order to quantify this policy, the first step was to establish the type
of generation that would be displaced by new renewable generation. It was assumed that coal
generation would be displaced. The next step was to establish the resource mix among specific
technologies that would comprise annual incremental renewable generation relative to the phasein schedule described in the policy. The next step was to establish cost and performance
14

Scenario 1 Mixed Renewables was selected by the Council in their meeting on February 2, 2011 to be used for the
analysis of ES and all-sector Action Plan policy results.
F-45

assumptions for each of the resources included to meet the policy goals (capital, fixed/variable
O&M, fuel, and transmission costs were incorporated into the analysis). Costs were compared on
the basis of levelized cost for the various sources. Coal steam (95%) and natural gas combustion
turbine (NGCT—5%) were assumed for intermittent renewable back-up, as needed. During
ramp-up and ramp-down for back-up power, a heat rate penalty of 15% was assumed.
Key Assumptions: The total renewable generation (i.e., renewable energy in the BAU scenario
plus incremental renewable generation from the policy) as a percentage of total utility generation
prior to any energy efficiency reductions:
•

2011–2013: 3%

•

2014–2016: 6%

•

2017–2018: 9%

•

2019–2020: 12%

•

2021–2030: 15%

There are several potential mixes of incremental renewable generation (i.e., the amount that is
over and above the renewable generation in the BAU scenario) that may serve Kentucky well
toward meetings its goals. For this reason, the costs and benefits of this policy were analyzed
from a scenario perspective. Specifically, four scenarios were considered as described below.
•

Mixed renewable scenario: Assumes a mix of renewable resources.

•

Biomass scenario: Assumes aggressive use of in-state biomass resources in dedicated
biomass and co-firing applications; in-state wind generation kept to de minimis levels.

•

Wind scenario: Assumes aggressive use of out-of-state wind resources; in-state wind
generation kept to de minimis levels.

•

Solar PV scenario: Assumes aggressive use of solar PV; in-state wind generation kept to de
minimis levels; balance obtained from out-of-state wind resources.

Incremental renewable generation assumptions for each of the four ES-7 scenarios analyzed are
summarized in Tables ES-7-2 through ES 7-5. For the years 2011–2014, incremental renewable
generation levels in all scenarios are assumed to be zero.

Key Uncertainties
•

Cost of providing the renewable electricity and meeting the efficiency targets.

•

TVA is not required to implement state policies. TVA could choose to implement similar
policy measures.

•

Methods for measuring compliance with the efficiency target (how will the utilities
demonstrate the target has been met?).

•

On January 12, 2011, EPA issued a three-year deferment on the inclusion of GHG emissions
from biogenic sources from regulation under the EPA GHG Tailoring Rule that went into
effect on January 2, 2011. While this is positive to the operational costs of projects currently
utilizing biomass feedstocks, the continued uncertainty may impact the increased utilization
of biomass feedstocks.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Additional benefits include economic development opportunities if renewable resources are
developed in state. Specifically, jobs could be created to develop the renewable resources.
Additionally, demand for renewable resources could spur manufacturing opportunities. Jobs
would be created to work toward energy efficiency targets. Customers who take advantage of
energy efficiency programs and incentives that may be created in response to this policy will
likely see a decrease in their electricity bills. In addition to GHGs, pollution, such as SO2 and
nitrogen dioxide could be reduced by developing renewable resources. Customers may pay more
per kWh for electricity derived from renewables.
Feasibility Issues
There are no feasibility issues at this time.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.

F-49

Level of Group Support
Super-majority, with one abstention and one objection.
Barriers to Consensus
The objection was based on a recognition that this policy may not be needed due to upcoming
federal regulations in the Clean Air Transport Rule.

ES-8. Technology Research and Development
(Not Including CCSR or Wind Potential Study)

Policy Description
Kentucky has historically benefited from low-cost energy supplies due to the state’s bountiful
supply of fossil fuel resources. However, with increasing environmental pressures on the
utilization of these resources, it is imperative that the state develop a broader portfolio of
environmentally feasible technologies for energy production. Technology research, development,
and demonstration RD&D) must play a critical role in the development of economically feasible
solutions for Kentucky’s future.
Kentucky, historically, has invested heavily in research and development (R&D) for fossil fuels.
This policy will develop a roadmap for expanding the research into renewable energy sources,
energy efficiency technologies, distributed/grid-scale storage, carbon-free fuel generation, and
pyrolysis of municipal solid waste, and will provide for large-scale demonstrations, as well as
smaller deployments in residential or commercial applications. The policy should enable
development of Kentucky-specific roadmaps for implementation of renewable energy generation
and conservation technologies.
One area of particular interest is the demonstration of solar electric generation. While PV
technology has been around for many years, it is only recently that its prices have begun to come
down to the point that PVs are being installed as part of utilities’ generation mix. In other parts
of the country, PVs are now being installed on a utility scale. While PV prices are not yet
competitive with cheaper generation currently in use in Kentucky, it is important that utilities
gain some experience now with this technology, so adoption will be easier as PV prices come
down and fossil fuel costs rise. Utilities need to gain experience with how to interconnect and
integrate utility-scale PVs into their systems. This will help to quantify the benefits of this
technology that will help utilities provide valuable power during expensive summer peak
periods. Another area of related interest is with utility-scale/substation-scale energy storage to
enable adaptation of solar electricity and peak-demand management.
Policy Design
Goals
•

A comprehensive roadmap for the ultimate deployment of solar electricity, renewable energy
storage, solar fuels, wind, biofuels, and other renewable energy forms within the
Commonwealth should be developed. The roadmap should identify areas of basic and/or
applied research required for ultimate deployment of the technologies. In addition,
demonstration projects should be identified.

•

A directed research effort for each technology gap identified in the roadmap should be
formulated. Research opportunity notices should be periodically be issued.

•

Where technologies are sufficiently mature, demonstration and/or pilot projects to bring the
technologies to commercial readiness should be facilitated.
F-51

•

DEDI should develop funding mechanisms for RD&D projects.

•

DEDI should develop communication plans regarding these technologies.

•

For analysis of this policy recommendation, the following assumptions should be used:
Install five utility-scale PV power plants of at least 1 MW each, with one of the plants being
at least 5 MW. Each of the major utilities in Kentucky should be targeted as partners in
installing these plants. Subsidies need to be supplied to bring the cost of these pilot plants
down to the point where they are cost competitive for the participating utilities. These pilot
plants may be installed directly by the utility, or by an independent power producer working
with a utility, in the utilities service territory.

Timing
•

December 2012—Publish a comprehensive renewable energy roadmap.

•

January 2013—Issue R&D notices.

•

February 2013—Issue demonstration project notices.

•

March 2013—Announce first-round funding for demonstration projects.

•

April 2013—Announce first-round funding for R&D projects.

•

2013—Parties, including utilities and others, should form a working group to identify
potential projects and project locations. This group should also quantify the level and source
of subsidies needed for each demonstration project, and work on securing these funds.

•

2014—Install the first of the 5 demonstration projects.

•

2015—Install the remaining 4 demonstration projects.

•

2016 and beyond—Take data from these projects that will aid in the installation of future
utility-scale PV plants.

Parties Involved: Parties involved in the implementation of this policy include state legislative
bodies and government offices, PSC, utilities and other energy suppliers, universities and other
research entities, CRERES.
Implementation Mechanisms
DEDI is currently organized to implement this policy. The first aspect of implementation is to
identify a panel of leading experts in each research area to assist in the development of the
renewable roadmap.
Funding mechanisms for the R&D efforts would have to be identified or created. These
mechanisms could include direct appropriations from the legislature, loans for demonstration
projects, or the institution of an R&D surcharge on utility services. In addition, rate recovery for
the larger projects should be allowed.

Data Sources: Same as previously indicated.
Quantification Methods: To quantify this policy, the first step was to establish the type of
generation that would be displaced by the new solar PV generation. It was assumed that coal
generation would be displaced. The next step was to establish cost and performance assumptions
for solar PV to meet the policy goals (capital, fixed/variable O&M, fuel, and transmissions costs
were incorporated into the analysis). Costs were compared on the basis of levelized cost. The
penetration was low enough that generation from NGCTs was not needed for backup generation.
Key Assumptions: The following assumptions were made:
•

4 centralized solar PV installations of 1 MW each.

•

1 centralized solar PV installation of 5 MW.

•

The same cost and performance assumptions as used in ES-7.

Key Uncertainties
The key uncertainties for the implementation of this policy are the sources of funding for RD&D
projects and utility cost recovery mechanisms.
Additional Benefits and Costs
•

Benefits over and above those quantified for the solar demonstration will be the development
of renewable technologies to further reduce GHGs and improve technology efficiencies, and
the development of new technologies.

•

With respect to the solar PV demonstration component, an important additional benefit is the
experience that utilities in Kentucky will gain with respect to interconnection, dispatch, and
impact of system peaks. Once utilities can quantify the benefit of shaving summer peak
loads, it will be easier to calculate the benefit of these systems in a cost-benefit analysis.

F-53

•

If solar PV manufacturing plants were built in Kentucky, it could bring additional
manufacturing jobs and revenues to the Commonwealth.

Feasibility Issues
•

The primary obstacle to the implementation of a state-sponsored R&D effort will be the
allocation of funding. The development of the R&D roadmap should include a mapping of
the desired research projects to federal, industrial, and other funding programs.

•

Cost recovery for R&D projects, such as the solar demonstration project described herein,
will be an issue for the successful implementation of a program involving utilities in
Kentucky.

•

With respect to solar PV manufacturing, two aspects are essential: (1) the availability of a
local solar PV market; and (2) the manufacturing R&D expertise and personnel needed.

ES-9. Policies to Support Wind Energy

Policy Description
Kentucky does not currently have any wind farms built or under development, despite the fact
that most U.S. states have at least one utility-scale wind project. Kentucky’s lack of development
is most likely attributed to a weak wind resource, low electricity prices, and lack of a renewable
energy mandate.
Despite lack of development, Kentucky’s wind resource continues to be a subject of debate.
Fueling this debate is the recent publication by the National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) of
new wind resource maps and corresponding data, which are intended to establish an onshore
resource potential for each state. Prior to the release of these maps, Kentucky relied on older
versions of the map that assumed wind turbines would be built at a lower hub height than what is
currently being developed. The new NREL maps show more wind capacity in Kentucky at a
100-meter hub height; however, that capacity is not at a capacity factor high enough to be
considered by industry for economic development. The current industry standard for
development is a minimum of a 30% capacity factor.
While the wind maps and calculations by NREL are helpful in understanding U.S. wind
resources, they lead to additional questions and the need for more data. Specifically, the maps
were developed using a model that was then validated with actual data points. NREL has not
collected wind speed data throughout Kentucky. Some states, such as Michigan, have taken the
process a step further by installing wind speed instruments on tall towers to further validate the
wind maps and better characterize the resource.
Kentucky could see wind farm development in the future. The Commonwealth has good
transmission system lines (69 kilovolts [kV] and up) across the state that might serve a
distributed network of wind farms. While other states may have higher wind speeds, some of the
sparsely populated sites are far from electric transmission. Additionally, wind turbine hub
heights are increasing, thereby taking advantage of higher wind speeds, and Kentucky might also
benefit from machines with longer blade lengths that are suitable for lower wind speeds.
If Kentucky is to develop wind capacity, it needs to better understand the resource. The state
should collect wind data to further validate or identify bias within the wind map. The data should
be published and may be used when crafting policies.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Spring 2012—Convene a Statewide Wind Working Group, consisting of experts from
government, utilities, independent power producers (IPPs), and universities, to identify
funding sources, tower locations, and an entity to manage and ensure the wide dissemination
of the data.

F-55

•

Summer–Fall 2012—Identify 10 potential wind sites around Kentucky, for placement of
meteorological towers. Locations should have good wind potential, as per the NREL studies,
should have the potential for large development of multiple units with good potential
construction access, and should be located within a reasonable distance of a transmission
line. Whenever possible, equipment should be installed on existing structures to reduce cost.
Areas deemed by NREL to have less certain wind speed, such as along ridge lines, should
also be targeted for wind data collection sites.

•

Fall–Winter 2012—Quantify the cost of monitoring, and acquire the funds necessary to
install the monitoring equipment and towers. Arrange for NREL to accommodate the data
and make revisions to Kentucky’s wind potential if possible and if needed.

•

Spring 2013–Summer 2014—Install equipment and collect and process data. Towers would
collect wind speed data at an elevation appropriate to extrapolate information about wind
speeds at 100 m and 120 m.

•

Spring 2013–Summer 2014—Identify turbine designs that are best suited for Kentucky’s
resource and landscape.

•

Fall 2014—Disseminate monitoring results to utilities, independent power producers, and the
general public who might be interested in smaller installations in the general areas.

•

Spring 2013–Fall 2014—Identify and work on state policy and legislative changes necessary
for large-scale wind implementation, provided the data indicate a need for this resource.
Complete an economic impact analysis based on the data to include levelized energy cost,
impact on tax revenue, jobs, and electricity rates. Based on the findings of the analysis, the
working group will recommend next steps, which may include specific goals for installed
capacity.

Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Participants in the Statewide Wind Working Group would include experts
from government, utilities, IPPs, independent transmission organizations, and universities.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
A Statewide Wind Working Group, consisting of experts from government, utilities, IPPs, and
universities should convene to identify funding sources, tower locations, and an entity to manage
and ensure the wide dissemination of the data.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Having a better understanding of wind speeds in Kentucky could play a major role in the
adoption of an RPS (ES-7) and FITs (ES-5). If lawmakers and utilities have a better
understanding of how much wind potential there is in Kentucky, they will have a better idea
regarding how much this resource can be relied upon when setting goals and policies.

F-56

A number of parties in Kentucky are already monitoring wind speed. East Kentucky Power
Cooperative and Iberdrola are collecting data at a few sites in Kentucky at utility-scale turbine
heights, and Kentucky Mesonet is collecting wind data at lower tower heights at about 50
locations. Working and coordinating with these existing monitoring programs might result in
earlier implementation of systematic high-elevation wind monitoring at a lower cost.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
ES-9 does not directly reduce GHGs, as it is a research policy. However, if the outcome of the
research is the development of in-state wind farms then the indirect reductions will be the
products of combustion, principally CO2 and NOx.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
While this policy is considered to be non-quantifiable, per se, as it involves a number of windrelated research activities, it is important to note that it will help to support and promote these
new levels of wind generation in Kentucky that are associated with other policies in this Climate
Action Plan. These other policies will lead to new levels of wind generation in Kentucky—
nearly a third of the total potential, as summarized in Table ES-9-1.

New Wind Generation in Kentucky (GWh)

For ES-7 (Renewable Energy Incentives and Barrier Removal, Including CHP), the ranges reported in the
table are based on the four scenarios considered under that policy recommendation.
GHG = greenhouse gas; GWh = gigawatt-hour; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

Data Sources: Not applicable.
Quantification Methods: Not applicable.
Key Assumptions: Not applicable.
Key Uncertainties
The key uncertainty is the source and amount of the funding needed for the proposed study.
Additional Benefits and Costs
The primary benefit is the understanding of the wind resource. It is possible that data could
reveal that the wind resource is limited. The benefit is the ability of this information to influence
policy. If there is a strong wind resource, that information will support wind development. If
there isn’t a strong resource, policymakers may work to develop other renewables. Knowledge
that shapes policy and investment is the benefit.

F-57

Another benefit beyond simply gathering data, determining actual wind speeds at locations
around Kentucky may jump-start wind development in Kentucky, by showing the viability of
specific locations to potential developers, including the state’s utilities.
The latest wind maps estimating wind speeds at higher elevations show improved potential in
other areas of the state. However, development in these areas would see projects with higher than
traditional capital costs, due to larger (taller) turbine requirements.
Feasibility Issues
Funding is the only issue. The equipment exists to implement this policy. Landowners,
universities, or contractors could manage and analyze the data. It all comes down to finding the
necessary funding.
There are no technical obstacles to the implementation of this policy. Considering the consensus
among government agencies, utilities, and environmental groups that this study needs to be done,
this should make finding funding more feasible.
One feasibility issue of importance will be who shares and who benefits from the cost of policy
implementation. For funds already contributed to a data collection effort the question remains:
Will these costs be recoverable from the “group” if data are shared?

ES-10. Shale Gas Development and Natural Gas Transportation
Infrastructure and Natural Gas Liquids Technology

Policy Description
The Shale Gas policy is intended to help stimulate increased shale gas production and
development in Kentucky. Increased Kentucky production will provide more natural gas supply
as an alternative fuel to help reduce overall GHG emissions. Additional production could provide
additional severance tax revenues to the state. Additional production could also have some
impact on national supply/demand balance, and thus could have some—although probably
limited—impact on natural gas prices.
The Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure policy is intended to help provide for the
development of a natural gas filling station infrastructure across Kentucky. This will help to
replace oil-based fuels and will thus reduce GHG emissions from vehicles.
The Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) policy is intended to provide for the development of liquid fuels
from natural gas. This will help to replace oil-based fuels and will reduce GHG emissions. There
are two possible options for NGL fuels. The first is cryogenically liquefied natural gas (LNG),
and the second is liquids removed from natural gas.
Diesel-fueled heavy vehicles converted to run on LNG offer four advantages: lower GHG
emissions, lower emissions of air pollutants, significantly reduced cost compared to diesel, and
reduced dependence on foreign oil. Liquids removed from natural gas prior to introducing it into
a pipeline are higher-value products and can also help reduce consumption of oil-based fuels.
Both of these alternatives should be pursued as part of Kentucky’s energy strategy. This strategy
contemplates the development of NGL capacity, which would produce an LNG fuel for heavy
trucks.
These vehicles utilize natural gas, a domestic fuel that can help to lessen U.S. dependence on
imported fuels. They can all help to stimulate Kentucky’s economy and create jobs in the state,
while continuing to develop Kentucky’s natural gas reserves. Additionally, they can provide
energy alternatives that help to reduce Kentucky’s GHG emissions and also reduce the state’s
and the country’s carbon footprint.
Policy Design
Goals: The goal for the Shale Gas policy is to provide for increased development of natural gas
from shale formations, with an increase from the current annual production level of
approximately 100 billion cubic feet per year (bcf/yr) to an annual level of 150 bcf/yr by 2020,
through increased drilling as well as enhanced drilling methods.
The goal for the Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure policy is to provide for the
development of a statewide network of compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations, in order to
(1) have natural gas filling stations in all cities with populations greater than 10,000 by 2020, and

F-59

(2) facilitate the increased use of natural gas as a vehicle fuel, to support the deployment of
11,700 CNG vehicles by 2020.
The goal for the NGL policy is to provide for the development of liquid fuel from natural gas, so
that such fuel could be used in 2,000 heavy vehicles by 2016 instead of oil-based fuels currently
used, such as gasoline or diesel fuel. Also, a secondary goal is to provide liquids removal
capacity to accommodate the 50% additional shale production goal by 2020. Removing more
liquids from the natural gas produced in Kentucky will alleviate liquids issues in pipelines, and
thus allow Kentucky production to be more easily marketable into interstate pipelines. The
marketability of such liquids could provide additional revenues to producers, gas processors, and
the state.
Timing: All policies are needed, and implementation should proceed on an expedited basis.
Parties Involved
•

The Shale Gas policy would apply to all future drilling in Kentucky, and would involve
natural gas producers as well as financial institutions (in support of funds for the
investments) and state agencies overseeing permits, etc.

•

The Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure policy would involve natural gas distribution
companies, the PSC, and the Transportation and Energy Cabinets.

•

The NGL policy would involve natural gas producers, natural gas distribution companies,
and natural gas transportation pipelines and midstream processing entities, and would support
new activity in cryogenically liquefying and distributing LNG.

Other: The Natural Gas Transportation Infrastructure policy should include evaluation of the
natural gas transmission and distribution infrastructure in Kentucky to determine suitable
available capacity for this program.
Implementation Mechanisms
Shale gas development should be encouraged by state action to ease the regulatory, permitting,
and lag time for new well development and completion. The legislature should consider tax or
other incentives to stimulate this development.
Natural gas transportation infrastructure should be developed by planning and building CNG
filling stations in cities of 10,000 people or more and along interstate highways in Kentucky.
Funding for the station network should be sought from federal funds, and/or the legislature
should consider tax or other incentives or providing funding. Consideration should be given to
efforts in other states, such as Utah.
NGL efforts would involve natural gas producers selling their natural gas for conversion to liquid
fuel, or for liquids removal and sale, and corresponding development of production facilities.
This may require legislative action to provide incentives to producers and/or plant operators,
especially if product market prices are not advantageous to producers and operators.

Data for the inputs were taken from various sources:
•

Data regarding carbon intensities and coefficients of fuels for the transportation sector,
vehicle purchase costs, and projected new-vehicle fuel efficiency for both CNG and gasoline
vehicles, were taken from Argonne National Laboratory’s (ANL’s) VISION model, which
maintains extensive and detailed projections of fleet and fuel characteristics through the year
2100. These values are themselves derived from DOE AEO 2009 and 2010 projections and
EPA’s GREET tool, which is used to develop full fuel-cycle carbon emission profiles of
fuels depending on location of source, feedstock, distribution pathway and tailpipe emissions.

•

Data regarding fueling station cost were taken from the Los Angeles County Sanitation
District’s pilot program for CNG fueling station installations: http://www.lacsd.org/info/

In addition to the vehicle and energy resources listed for the Natural Gas Infrastructure Policy,
the following were utilized for this strategy:

Cost estimates for developing horizontal wells were taken from sources at the Geosciences
Department at Penn State University as well as Chesapeake Energy. 17 The two estimates
were rounded to a 2005$ cost of $1,000,000 per well, with operating costs of approximately
$1.00 per million cubic feet. Typical reserves for horizontal wells were assumed to be 2.5 bcf
per well. 18

Quantification Methods
Natural Gas Infrastructure Policy
Per the policy design of the ES TWG, the scenario involves the installation of 70 CNG fueling
stations in cities around Kentucky by 2030. This value represents an average of just over two
stations in each community with a population above 10,000, though the TWG considered that
stations would most likely be concentrated in larger cities and along highway corridors.
Station service capacity, in volumes of fuel supplied per year, was used in combination with the
projected fuel efficiency of new CNG vehicles and their projected annual vehicle miles of travel
(VMT) to determine the fleet supported by the 70 stations. Each station was determined to
support approximately 430 light-duty CNG vehicles (assuming a mix of light trucks and autos
equivalent to Kentucky’s light-duty fleet projections).
The new infrastructure was assumed to be put into place gradually, following a linear ramp-up of
three or four new stations per year and reaching a total of 70 stations in 2030. Additional lightduty vehicles (LDVs) powered by CNG fuel were assumed to enter the market, only after fueling
capacity for LDVs was established, and LDVs were expected to come online gradually. New
LDVs were assumed to enter the market such that the size of the CNG-powered fleet consistently
lagged two years behind the maximum capacity that the fueling infrastructure could support.

GHG savings were determined through the above-mentioned carbon coefficients for gasoline and
CNG, along with volumes of fuel determined to be used (CNG) or displaced (gasoline). Fuel
costs and savings were also determined similarly.
Note that the additional fuel supply for this policy was assumed to come from the Shale Gas
policy (see below). Because these two policies are assumed to work in concert (one providing the
fuel and the other distributing the fuel), the two are reported together as a single policy for the
purpose of GHG reduction impact and program cost.
Natural Gas Liquids Policy
This analysis contemplates the production of LNG fuel.
From the sources cited above, costs for plant operations were estimated as follows: processing
and distribution costs were estimated at $3.70 per million Btu produced in 2005 dollars, per the

F-63

estimates of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin.19 Capital costs were assumed to be
borne by pre-existing investments in natural gas infrastructure.
Fuel volumes were determined from the fleet mandates in this strategy. This approach involved
using the projected fuel efficiency of heavy-duty vehicles and the projected VMT per year of
heavy-duty trucks to be fueled by this fuel supply. This produced a projection of a fuel volume of
approximately 31 million gallons in 2020, and 59 million gallons in 2030.

HDV = heavy-duty vehicle; LNG = liquefied natural gas; MPG = miles per gallon; VMT = vehicle miles
traveled.

Shale Gas Policy
The Shale Gas policy seeks to increase in-state production of natural gas from in-state reserves
from 100 bcf/yr to 150 bcf/yr by 2020. By 2020, the energy content of this additional natural gas
supply would be equivalent to that of approximately 411 million gallons of gasoline.
A number of factors make it unlikely that the vast majority of this new supply of natural gas will
displace gasoline or diesel during 2011–2030:
•

Current DOE projections for annual natural gas consumption as a transportation fuel in the
entire United States reach approximately 90 million gallons per year, which is just below
20% of the amount this policy seeks to produce.

•

DOE AEO projections for the natural-gas-powered fleet (which serve as a baseline for this
analysis) indicate expectations of only modest growth: the fleet, currently numbering
approximately 120,000 vehicles nationwide, would reach only 160,000 vehicles in 2030. The
Natural Gas Infrastructure policy (above) would add 27,000 vehicles in Kentucky,
representing a 60% increase in the entire nation’s projected growth rate.

•

Under the Natural Gas Infrastructure policy, Kentucky will put into place the capacity to
distribute 1.53 bcf of natural gas by 2030, leaving the vast majority of newly produced shale
gas without a distribution pathway through which it could enter the transportation-fuels
market.

diesel, along with the projection of insignificant growth in demand for CNG as a transportation
fuel in the absence of this policy, this analysis assumes that any supply not consumed pursuant to
the Natural Gas Infrastructure policy will be directed to the energy sector, and cannot be
assumed to achieve GHG reductions. Table ES-10-4 presents the volume assumptions developed
with regard to amounts of natural gas directed to the transportation and energy sectors.

bcf = billion cubic feet.

The volumes directed to transportation and to energy supply should be considered as upper
bounds, because they do not assume any energy content loss during the processes of compression
or liquefaction. Significant inefficiencies in those processes would reduce the amount directed
toward the energy supply, but would not increase the amount displacing petroleum fuels, and
thus would not increase the GHG reductions from this strategy.
Because this policy is assumed to direct a total of 14.75 bcf to the transportation sector over the
2011–2030 period, the costs of six wells were applied. The overall policy, seeking to produce 50
bcf/yr, would require over 300 wells over the period if the 2.5-bcf-per-well reserve estimate
proves accurate.

ES-11. Smart Grid, Including Transmission and Distribution Efficiency

Policy Description
The term “smart grid” has taken on wide range of meanings. Smart grid can be divided into two
functional areas: customer load and use management, and T&D monitoring and control.
Application of each can result in increased electrical efficiency, utilization, operational
efficiency, reliability, or electricity load management. Each of the functional areas relies on
advanced monitoring, controls, data analysis, and communications.
Kentucky’s electric utilities are in various stages of deploying advanced metering infrastructure
(AMI), or electric meters that are able to record consumption and other data hourly or more
frequently, and are capable of two-way communication with a central location. The meters are
also capable of communicating with equipment within the customer’s premises. In addition to
allowing customers to control their own usage more effectively, AMI enables various pricing
strategies (specifically time-of-day rates and other approaches identified in ES-5, Pricing
Strategies) designed to effectively implement energy efficiency, conservation, and demand
response programs that can reduce GHG emissions. Successful implementation of AMI and key
features of the Smart Grid are required to enable the pricing strategies recommended in ES-5.
T&D monitoring and control are other areas where energy losses and service improvements can
be gained. Enhanced voltage monitoring and control, real-time ambient condition monitoring,
and automated switching are examples of “smart technologies.” Also, installation of higherefficiency transformers and conductors can reduce energy losses in the delivery systems. T&D
equipment is characterized by long-life assets, but replacements, when needed, should be with
higher-efficiency designs over time. Distribution equipment is already subject to revised, higherefficiency DOE standards, and higher-efficiency distribution transformers may not be costeffective at this time. 21
Installation of smart grid technologies will enable other technologies, such as integration of
intermittent or distributed generation.
This policy should be designed to accelerate the deployment of smart grid technologies and
electricity delivery efficiency improvements. Current legislation and/or regulations require
utilities to provide service in a least-cost manner. Those requirements for least cost would have
to be modified to accomplish the objectives of this policy.
Some studies have shown the use of prepay meters in conjunction with in-home displays to be an
effective pricing strategy to reduce energy consumption. With prepay meters, customers pay in
advance to “load up” their electric meter for the amount of money they want to budget for
electricity. They utilize an in-home display to monitor their use and money left on the meter.
Some utilities that have experience with prepay meters report that the approach tends to
21

DOEFinalRule.pdf.

F-67

encourage customers to seek from the utility conservation and weatherization assistance. There
continues to be a valid concern that this type of service would disadvantage low-income
customers and result in service termination during critical periods of heat or cold. These
concerns would have to be addressed in a prepay meter tariff or policy.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Achieve 25% coverage for AMI by 2015, 50% by 2020, and 100% by 2025.

•

Replace transmission infrastructure (transformers and conductors) with higher-efficiency
equipment as projects are implemented. Reduce transmission losses by 10% by 2030.

•

Replace distribution infrastructure (transformers and conductors) with higher-efficiency
equipment as projects are implemented. Reduce distribution losses by 10% by 2030.

T&D losses are typically around 5%, so a 10% reduction in the losses would be 0.5% reduction
of the net generation.
The use of a prepaid meter program should be studied to determine whether and the extent to
which conservation and efficiency gains associated with prepaid meter programs are greater than
those of AMI with in-home display. Any prepaid meter program should be designed to
encourage conservation and efficiency for all customers and should not be targeted at lowincome ratepayers. The programs should be completely voluntary, and customers should not be
coerced into participating. Programs must provide similar hardship protections to customers as
those provided to customers under traditional pricing mechanisms, such as protection against
winter disconnection and access to heating assistance (both the subsidy and the crisis
components of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program).
Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: These policies would apply to all electric utilities and will require enabling
legislation, in the form of funding mechanisms and/or PSC authority for special rate treatment.
Affected parties include electric utilities (PSC regulated, TVA distributors, and municipally
owned) and customers.
Other: Pricing signals and active participation from customers will be necessary for end-use
reduction. A renewable and efficiency standard would encourage grid enhancements as a means
to meet the efficiency standard.
Implementation Mechanisms
Implementation mechanisms for AMI deployment include customer education programs, tax
incentives for smart appliances, examination of regulatory recovery models, and identification of
consumer value from implementation. Kentucky could provide financial incentives that support
customer education regarding the benefits and use of AMI and Smart Meters. As end-use
reduced consumption from pricing signals is predicated on consumer behavioral changes, it is

F-68

necessary to educate consumers about the benefits and use of AMI/Smart Meters to gain their
acceptance.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Electricity pricing structure directly impacts the benefits of AMI deployment. Several smart grid
grants have been awarded, and most electric utilities in the state are implementing smart grid
technologies at some level. TVA distributors will likely begin phasing in time-of-day rates by
April 1, 2011, due to changes in TVA’s wholesale rate structure.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Smart meters enable end-use conservation programs and, in concert with T&D enhancements,
and can reduce emissions associated with the combustion of fossil fuel for electricity, principally
CO2 and NOx.

Quantification Methods: The analysis of this policy focused on the costs and benefits
associated with the penetration of smart meters for retail electricity customers. The modeling
framework integrated physical and performance characteristics. The overall approach for smart
meter penetration estimated the costs and GHG reductions associated with replacing existing
metering with smart metering technology. The first step was to establish the annual targets for
new equipment. The next step was to establish Baseline scenario absolute equipment levels. The

F-69

next step was to establish costs for replacement of existing equipment. These were developed
consistent with information from EPRI. Costs of incremental smart metering equipment were
calculated on an annual as well as a present value basis. The next step was to calculate avoided
GHG emissions and the cost of saved carbon given the assumption that coal was on the margin.

In addition, it was assumed that the incremental upper bound cost of commercial, residential, and

ES-11-3 above, is $775 per meter installed (2009$), bringing total system costs to $1,000 for the
advanced meter and associated infrastructure.

F-71

Key Uncertainties
Key uncertainties for AMI deployments include the cost of implementation; the cost of
supporting communication and information technology systems or infrastructure; technology
obsolescence; unproven and emerging technologies; uncertainties of cyber-security
requirements; the lack of standards development; the uncertainty over regulatory treatment,
requiring examination of traditional cost-recovery models to support wide-scale deployment; the
ability of the entire cross-section of customers to accept and utilize smart grid/smart home
technologies; whether consumers will modify behavior enough to significantly reduce peak load
or energy usage; and proper pricing mechanisms or structures that lead customers to modify their
behavior without creating dissatisfaction.
The key uncertainty for investment in T&D smart technologies is the cost/benefit analysis of the
cost of power versus the reduction of electrical losses. Another uncertainty is the technology
optimism for both the hardware and the system management software.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Additional benefits of AMI deployment may include consumers’ increased awareness of energy
consumption, the ability to remotely monitor and control household energy usage (only with
proper and adequate communication and information technology infrastructure), the ability to
gather and analyze consumption data, increased reliability (shorter disruption times), the utility
having more system awareness due to more monitoring points, and the potential to optimize
electrical vehicle charging to the distribution system.
Additional costs include increased security risks and potential loss of personal privacy (utilities
will be able to monitor customers’ real-time activities).
Feasibility Issues
The issues of regulatory cost recovery and cost-benefit analysis results may impede the
achievement of this policy goal.

ES-12. Coal-to-Liquids Production: GHG Emission Reduction
Incentives, Support, or Requirements

Policy Description
The Coal to Liquids (CTL) policy is based on the fact that coal is the only domestically
obtainable asset recoverable and available in sufficient quantity to meet America’s demand for
chemicals and liquid transportation fuels that are currently manufactured using foreign oil
supplies. In fact, 94% of this nation’s Btu is found in U.S. coal reserves. Natural gas and crude
oil represent 4% and 2%, respectively, of the Btu total. A robust CTL industry would have a
large positive impact on energy independence and national security. Unfortunately, traditional
manufacture of liquids from coal (as exemplified by SASOL in South Africa) emits considerably
more (some say as much or more than double) GHGs than manufacturing the same liquids from
oil. Consequently, any move toward developing a CTL industry that has GHG reduction as a
primary goal must include a method of reducing GHG emissions in the CTL manufacturing
process. Currently, the only options on the horizon for accomplishing that reduction are using
CO2 captured during the CTL manufacturing process for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and/or
coal bed methane recovery (CBMR), or capturing the CO2 and sequestering it underground.
Fortunately, both of these options appear feasible under the right circumstances (see
Implementation Mechanisms).
The Coal to Gas (CTG) policy is based on using coal to enhance domestic natural gas supplies
and to prevent the United States from becoming dependent on foreign supplies of natural gas. It
shares many of the same characteristics, drivers, and constraints as CTL. The primary difference
is that the supply-side characteristics (domestic supply and pricing) for oil support developing a
CTL industry. Domestic natural gas supplies, on the other hand, have increased enormously in
the last few years, and it appears that they will continue to increase for the foreseeable future.
Demand for natural gas is also increasing, and with the advantage in GHG emissions per unit of
power produced that natural gas has over coal, demand is expected to continue to rise.
Consequently, the future for natural gas prices and the answer to whether a CTG industry would
be economically viable are much less certain.
Therefore, it is recommended that the CTG industry should not be pursued at this time. However,
it should be noted that the enablers for CTL (EOR and CCS) in a carbon-constrained world are
also necessary to enable CTG. So if in the future CTG becomes more attractive economically,
then the same actions discussed in the Implementation Mechanisms section of this policy will be
as necessary for CTG as they are for CTL.
CTL, especially in a carbon-constrained environment, will be necessary to maintain (and
potentially increase) demand for Kentucky coal. This will directly improve the nation’s energy
independence and security, and help to stimulate Kentucky’s economy and create jobs, while
continuing to develop Kentucky’s coal reserves. It can also help to reduce Kentucky’s GHG
emissions and the state’s and country’s carbon footprint.

F-73

Policy Design
Goals: The goal for the CTL policy is to provide as many gallons of CTL diesel as Kentucky
uses by 2025.
Timing: For the purpose of analysis, assume CTL production comes on line in 2018. Work on
the Implementation Mechanisms (see below) should proceed on an expedited basis. For CTL to
be viable in a carbon-constrained world, contracts and pipeline construction for EOR and
enhanced CBMR projects must be developed as soon as possible, and carbon sequestration
development must progress rapidly.
Parties Involved: The CTL policy will involve coal producers, pipeline builders, and oil
producers (for EOR), carbon sequestration firms and KGS (for CCS development), financial
institutions, and state agencies overseeing permits, etc.
Other: If a robust CTL industry results in additional demand for coal, educational institutions
(both universities and technical colleges) must be ready to meet the demand for skilled workers,
for both the CTL industry and the coal mining industry.
Implementation Mechanisms
Some implementation mechanisms that can be taken to improve the borrowing climate for the
debt-financed portion of a CTL project include:
•

A state guarantee to purchase some or all of the off-take from a facility, with or without a
price floor and ceiling to help ensure the profitability of the plant (i.e., floor of $55/barrel
[bbl] and a ceiling of $85/bbl).

•

Cost-control of the facility’s raw material through long-term guaranteed contracts with
suppliers.

•

Guarantees regarding timing of the permitting process.

•

Assistance with direct payment for some of the preliminary design requirements. For
example, a rule of thumb is that the cost of the front-end engineering design (FEED) is about
1% of the project cost. So on a $7 billion project, the FEED would cost about $70 million.
The state could help defray that cost recoverable against IEIA incentives.

•

Project cost share, possibly awarded competitively to the most attractive projects.

•

Investment tax credits.

•

Statutory exemption from standard rules that grant a given electric utility a monopoly on
providing retail electricity in a certain geographic area (e.g., allow a gasification project to
“wheel” any electricity generated from waste heat directly to a user at rates more favorable
than the gasification project would get from the local utility).

•

Provision of bond funding, or bond guarantees.

•

Regulatory changes to ease right-of-way acquisition through eminent domain actions.

F-74

•

Continuing the encouragement of a pilot system to enhance the comfort level of investors by
producing quantities of fuel for testing by engine manufacturers and for standards
development, as well as a training platform and development of improved technologies.

•

Preferential funding for infrastructure requirements (such as local road improvements) that
will facilitate operations at the proposed plant site.” 22

Related Policies/Programs in Place
CTL facilities meeting minimum criteria are eligible for tax incentives under IEIA. Biomass
could be co-fired (co-gasified) in a CTL facility.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Emission reductions would be principally CO2, although depending upon the assumptions used
and performance of the CCSR technology, it is possible the policy could result in zero reductions
or possibly a slight increase in emissions.

Data Sources
Data Regarding GHG Impacts
The GHG impacts assessed for this analysis are full fuel-cycle impacts, which seek to take into
account not only the tailpipe emissions produced by burning the fuel in the automobile, but also
the emissions associated with extraction, refining, and distribution steps taken prior to
combustion by the end user. Emissions from these activities are referred to as “upstream”

Energy Independence, page 64, November 2008.

emissions or as “well-to-tank” emissions, indicating that they represent the emissions generated
from getting the fuel from the point of extraction into the fuel tank where it will be consumed.
Many analyses have been completed that compare Fischer-Tropsch fuels (fuels produced by the
process used to convert coal to a diesel substitute) against conventional petroleum fuels on a
GHG emissions basis. These studies make varying assumptions, primarily about feedstocks that
supply the Fischer-Tropsch process and about the extent to which carbon capture and storage
technology can reduce the upstream emissions associated with refining the inputs into a
transportation fuel. Table ES-12-2 attempts to briefly summarize the various estimates and to
illustrate the basis for selection of the GHG factor most appropriate to this analysis.

The two most widely known estimates are the EPA and NETL estimates at the bottom of Table
ES-12-2. The NETL estimate, which is the only estimate to find significant reductions, appears
to achieve this by accounting for zero GHG emissions from refining (NETL, p. 10). The EPA
report, by contrast, applies assumptions that electricity inputs (with their own emissions) are
required to sequester carbon. Other resources also find that sequestration is less than 100%
efficient—between 85% and 95% efficient, resulting in non-zero values from refining.
For the purpose of this analysis, the EPA estimate is used. The rationale behind this selection is
the similarity of the non-zero emissions assumption to most other resources regarding the
emission-reduction efficacy of methods such as EOR and coalbed methane recovery. Analyses of
these methods generally find some emissions from (1) the fuels produced (oil and methane,
respectively) and (2) less-than-complete capture of emissions generated.

NETL produced Figure ES-12-1 to provide a summary of the comparative GHG emission
intensities of a variety of fuels when compared against petroleum fuels (from the EPA report)..27
Figure ES-12-1. Comparative GHG Impacts of Different Fuel Supply Pathways

This figure summarizes the above research in identifying that CTL fuels with aggressive CCS
may be capable of emissions roughly in line with diesel emissions. Superior CCS, achieving
capture of 95% or more of carbon emitted as part of the refining process, may achieve slight
reductions (up to 4%) below diesel life-cycle emissions.
However, these numbers take into account neither the risk that CCS processes are not utilized to
full potential (either because of cost or storage capacity considerations), nor the risk of leakage
of stored gases, as has happened in the past. 28 These risks are significant in light of the estimate
that CTL fuels are roughly twice as carbon intensive as diesel and gas in the absence of effective
CCS (see the red bar at the right of Figure ES-12-1). Even under the most promising GHG

operating time, would significantly worsen the emissions profile of the facility.
Quantification Methods: Kentucky’s I&F was utilized to develop year-by-year estimates of
overall diesel use in the state to determine the scale of CTL production volume necessary to meet
this policy goal. Energy use baseline estimates from diesel were converted to GHG emission
estimates based on the full fuel-cycle emissions of diesel and CTL fuels. Emission impacts were
derived from the relative impact estimates developed by EPA and the overall emissions profile of
the diesel fleet. Per the strategy design, CTL production was assumed to come online in 2018,
and to reach target capacity by 2025, staying there through 2030. Table ES-12-3 presents the
emission reductions resulting from CCS under the high and low EPA estimates of GHG impacts
relative to the emissions of diesel.

Program Costs and Competitiveness
In a 2010 report commissioned by the Natural Resources Defense Council, Advanced Resources
International estimated that CTL fuel with EOR carbon-capture technology would be
competitive and would find a market so long as oil prices stayed consistently above $70 per
barrel, and the costs to store carbon stayed at or below $15/tCO2 captured. 29
Oil price projections must be taken with limited confidence. DOE base case projections expect
imported crude oil to remain well above that $70 floor (actually between $95 and $110 per
barrel) throughout the 2018–2030 period considered for this analysis. However, DOE also
publishes a low-oil-price scenario, in which the projection for the price of a barrel is consistently

29

F-78

below $45. While this is a lower boundary, this projection (along with the volatility of oil prices
generally) indicates that the CTL industry will face significant risks from oil prices.
For the costs of CCS, two estimates were selected for the in-U.S. cost, both measured on a perton basis. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cited a lower cost, at roughly
$22/tCO2 stored, 30 while NETL estimated a much higher cost at $45/tCO2 stored. 31 This analysis
assumed a cost of $33.50, or the average of these two divergent estimates. This approach
simplifies the inherently complex cost structure of purchasing significant new capital and
accounting for depreciation, but does so in an attempt to benefit from past research that has
synthesized the cost elements already. The estimate of the amount of carbon captured was
derived from the midpoint of EPA’s range of emissions from CTL fuels production without CCS
(99% higher than petroleum) and EPA’s midpoint for emissions from CTL with CCS (3.7%), to
produce an amount equal to 95.3% of the emissions of fuel displaced.

reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, 32 necessitating significant new resources and
expanded access to financing.
Key Assumptions: This strategy assumes a roughly linear ramp-up from no new CTL capacity
in 2017 to a capacity equal to Kentucky’s diesel use in 2025, and rising with diesel use through
2030.
Key Uncertainties
For this technology to reduce GHGs, it will have to also utilize CCS (see ES-4). The CTL
process lends itself to CO2, but the time frame for the storage of the CO2 is uncertain, as is the
cost. Access to capital is another uncertainty. Since CTL will compete with petroleum, the price
of oil is an important factor that is very uncertain; for CTL to be economically viable, crude oil
must stay above a threshold amount for the life of a CTL plant.
It is not certain to the ES TWG whether the combustion of the CTL fuel results in more carbon
emissions than the petroleum-based fuel it is displacing.
Another concern is the long-term effect of the use of the alternative fuel on engines.
Manufacturers remain unsure about the use of these fuels, as there has not been enough research
in this area. The recommendation to construct a small-scale pilot facility to produce CTL fuels to
support such testing is in response to this concern.
Additional Benefits and Costs
The use of CTL will increase the energy independence of Kentucky and the nation by reducing
our reliance on imported petroleum. This policy would lead to the continued and increased use of
Kentucky coal-producing jobs, increased severance, and other tax revenue.
The benefits and cost of CO2 reduction will be addressed in the technical evaluation.
Feasibility Issues
There are multiple feasibility issues, especially associated with the future availability and cost of
CCS, as noted above and in related policies.
Status of Group Approval
Rejected.
Level of Group Support
Two in favor, two abstentions, four objections.

Barriers to Consensus
Members objecting to the inclusion of ES-12 believe that this policy does not reduce GHG
emissions, and thus is inappropriate to be included in Kentucky’s Climate Action Plan. The
analysis conducted shows that even with carbon capture, optimistic assumptions are needed to
achieve a tiny reduction in carbon emissions. When those optimistic assumptions are not used,
this policy actually increases carbon emissions. The objectors believe that while this policy may
have a place in a plan to increase coal use, it is not a strategy to reduce carbon emissions and
should not be included in the Climate Action Plan.

Annex 1. Calculation of Levelized Costs
This annex provides a brief conceptual overview as well as an annotated example regarding the
calculation of levelized costs associated with power generation technology. Levelized costs are
useful in evaluating financial feasibility and for directly comparing the cost of one technology
against another.
Conceptual Overview of Levelized Costs
Levelized cost can be defined as a constant annual cost that is equivalent on a present value basis
to the actual annual costs. That is, if one calculates the present value of levelized costs over a
certain period, its value would be equal to the present value of the actual costs of the same
period. Using levelized costs, often reported in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), allows for a
ready comparison of technologies in any year—something that would be more difficult to do
with differing annual costs. This concept is illustrated Figure ES-A-1. The present value of the
levelized costs is equal to the present value of the annual costs.

$/MWh = dollars per megawatt-hour.

Components of Levelized Costs
Several components make up levelized costs:
•

Capital costs: Typically reported in units of dollars per kilowatt ($/kW), these costs include
the total costs of construction, including land purchase, land development, permitting,
interconnections, equipment, materials, and all other components. Construction financing
costs are also included.

F-82

•

Fixed O&M: Typically reported in units of dollars per kilowatt-year ($/kW-yr), these costs
are for those that occur annually, regardless of how much the plant operates. They typically
include staffing, overhead, regulatory filings, and miscellaneous direct costs.

•

Variable O&M: Typically reported in units of dollars per megawatt-hour ($/MWh), these
costs are for those that occur annually, based on how much the plant operates. They typically
include costs associated with maintenance and overhauls, including repairs for forced
outages, consumables, water use, and environmental compliance costs.

•

Fuel: Typically reported in units of dollars per million British thermal units ($/MMBtu),
these costs are for startup fuel use, as well as online fuel use.

Information Needed to Calculate Levelized Costs
Additional information is needed to calculate levelized costs, as briefly described below:
•

Plant size: This refers to the size of the plant, expressed in units of megawatts (MW).

•

Capacity factor: This refers to the share of the year that the plant is in operation, expressed as
a percentage.

•

Capital recovery factor: This refers to assumptions regarding the plant lifetime, the effective
interest rate or discount rate used to amortize capital costs, and various other factors specific
to the power industry (see subsection that follows). Expressed as a decimal, capital recovery
factors are typically between 0.10 and 0.20. (See below and Annex 2 of this document for a
detailed explanation of capital recovery factors and a sensitivity analysis of two capital
recovery factor assumptions and their impacts on policy quantification results.)

•

Fuel price projection: This refers to the projected price of the fuel used to produce electricity
over the lifetime of the plant, expressed in units of $/MMBtu.

•

Heat rate: This refers to the efficiency by which fuel is consumed for the production of
electricity, expressed in units of British thermal units per kilowatt-hour (Btu/kWh).

Additional Information Regarding the Capital Recovery Factor
The capital recovery factor (CRF) depends on a number of factors, as briefly described below:
•

Cost of capital: This refers to the capital needed to construct the power supply facility, and is
typically obtained from a bank in the form of debt and funds borrowed from shareholders in
the form of a reduction in shareholder retained earnings or an issuance of capital stock. The
bank charges interest on the debt, and shareholders have an anticipated return on equity for
the funds provided the company. The weighted-average cost of capital is the weighted
average of the interest and the return on equity shareholders expect from investments of
similar risk.

•

Income tax shelters: Depending on how the facility is financed and how the plant cost is
depreciated, income tax reductions can result that offset some of the cost. Depreciation is an
expense on the income statement that has the effect of reducing income taxes, but is not an
actual cash outflow. Therefore, its effect on cash flow is to reduce the income tax liability.
Also, interest on debt is an expense on the income statement that, too, reduces the income tax
burden, having the net effect of reducing the cost of financing with debt. On the other hand,
F-83

the costs of financing with equity are paid back to shareholders in the form of earnings and
are not expensed on the income statement. Dividends paid to preferred shareholders are not
tax deductible. Therefore, financing with equity provides no income tax sheltering effect for
the business.
•

Property taxes: While property tax rules vary from locality to locality, in most cases they are
equal to some fraction of the assessed value of the property, which is often the book value.
Depending upon the location, some facility improvements may be exempt from property tax.

•

Insurance: The cost of insurance on the plant assets is normally included in the CRF. It is
typically a small fraction of the book value of the plant assets.

Formulas Used to Calculate Levelized Costs
There are several formulas needed to convert the various units into the $/MWh units used to
express levelized costs. These are briefly described below.
•

Capital costs (CC): These costs are converted to $/MWh units as per the formula below:
Levelized capital cost = CC * CRF * conversion factor / (HPY * CF)
Where:

CC = capital cost ($/kW)
CF = capacity factor (%)
HPY = hours per year = 8,760
CRF = capital recovery factor
conversion factor = 1,000 (convert from kW to MW)

•

Fixed O&M (FOM): These costs are converted to $/MWh units as per the formula below:
Levelized fixed O&M cost = FOM * conversion factor / (HPY * CF)
Where:

FOM = fixed O&M ($/kW-yr)
CF = capacity factor (%)
HPY = hours per year = 8,760
conversion factor = 1,000 (convert from kW to MW)

•

Variable O&M (VOM): These costs are already provided in units of $/MWh, so no
conversion is needed.

•

Fuel costs (FC): Each year’s fuel price is converted to units of $/MWh as follows:
Fuel price = FPt * HR / conversion factor
Where:

FPt = fuel price in year t ($/MMBtu)
HR = heat rate (Btu/kWh)
Conversion factor = 1,000 (convert from kW to MW)
t = year in the plant lifetime
F-84

These annual fuel costs are then levelized as follows:
Levelized fuel cost = [ PV * DR * (1+DR)t ] / [ (1 + DR)t – 1 ]
Where:

PV = present value of discounted fuel cost stream
DR = discount rate

Example Calculation of Levelized Costs
The above information can be combined to develop the levelized cost for any technology. As an
example, the case of a conventional natural gas-fired combined cycle plant is considered. Table
ES-A-1 summarizes the starting assumptions. Levelized cost calculations are offered in the
bullets that follow.

Capital costs: The levelized capital cost is equal to:
Levelized capital cost = 703 * 0.12 * 1,000 / (8,760 *0.65) = $14.82/MWh

•

Fixed O&M: The levelized fixed O&M cost is equal to:
Levelized fixed O&M cost = 12.14 * 1,000 / (8,760 * 0.65) = $2.13/MWh



Variable O&M: The levelized variable O&M cost is equal to $2.01/MWh

•

Fuel costs: The present value of the discounted fuel cost stream is equal to $104.35/MMBtu.
The levelized fuel cost is equal to:
[ 104.35 * 0.05 * (1+0.05)30 ] / [ (1 + 0.05)30 – 1 ] = $6.79/MMBtu
This levelized value is then converted to units of $/MWh as follows:
Levelized fuel cost = 6.79 * 7,064 / 1,000 = $47.97/MWh

F-85

•

Total levelized cost: The total levelized cost is equal to the sum of the above components, as
follows:
Total levelized cost = levelized CC + levelized FOM + VOM + levelized FC = 14.82 + 2.13
+ 2.01 + 47.97 = $66.93/MWh

Annex 2. Sensitivity Analysis of Capital Recovery Factor
This annex provides the results of a sensitivity analysis of the effect of the capital recovery factor
(CRF) on the cost-effectiveness of the ES policies involving power generation. As indicated in
the previous ES policy descriptions, a constant value of 0.115 was used across all fossil, nuclear,
and biomass technologies. CRFs for renewable facilities as presented previously assume they
will be merchant-owned or located out of state and are lower than CRFs for nonrenewable
generation facilities. To assess the impact of the use of the CRF used, a sensitivity analysis was
conducted. Table ES-A-2-1 provides a summary of the CRFs used in the sensitivity analysis.
Table ES-A-2-2 summarizes the effect of the changes in the CRF on the cost-effectiveness of
each of the ES policies involving power generation.

GHG reductions are calculated for each year (columns three and four above) and the cumulative for 2010–2030 (column

The cost per tCO2e (column seven) over 2010–2030 is the discounted, net present value of the 2010–2030 cash flows in

The numbering used to denote the above policy recommendations is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect
prioritization among these important policies.
*This analysis reflects the use of full-fuel-cycle GHG emission factors.
On October 27, 2010, the RCI Technical Work Group (TWG) discussed the issue of direct versus “full-fuel-cycle”
emission factors. Full-fuel-cycle GHG emission factors include the GHG emissions associated with the production,
processing, transmission, and distribution of fuels and electricity. These “upstream” emissions associated with energy
supply are 5%–25% greater than direct, or end-use, emission factors that are calculated as a result of fuel combustion at
the power station or building. On the October 27 call, the RCI TWG decided to present the summary table above
showing GHG emissions and cost-effectiveness based on full-fuel-cycle emission factors. The work group also decided
that the results for each RCI policy recommendation should show both direct and full fuel cycle emissions factors. On
balance, the difference in 2011–2030 cumulative GHG reductions is about 10% between the two methodologies. The
choice of emission factor does not impact the net present value calculations. However, because cumulative 2011–2030
GHG emission reductions are increased under full-fuel-cycle emission factors, the $/ton cost-effectiveness estimates will
differ modestly between the two methodologies.

Policy Overlap Discussion
The Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) and the Residential, Commercial, and
Industrial (RCI) Technical Work Group (TWG) quantified seven policy options to reduce the
emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the RCI sector. RCI-10 (Advanced Metering) was
duplicative with ES-11 and has been developed and quantified by the Energy Supply TWG. In
addition to estimating the impacts of each individual policy, the combined impacts of the quantified
policies were estimated, assuming that all were implemented together. This involved eliminating
any overlaps in coverage that would occur to avoid double counting of impacts. Also, some of the
policies in one sector overlapped with policies in another sector; therefore, these overlaps were
identified and the impact analysis was adjusted to eliminate double counting of impacts associated
with these intersectoral overlaps. This section identifies where these overlaps occurred and explains
their treatment.
RCI Sector Cumulative Impacts Analysis Methodology
To assess the cumulative emission reductions for the policies in the RCI sector, it is necessary to
consider any overlaps among the policies that affect similar types of energy use. Specifically, some
policies (such as RCI-2) are defined by their goals for reducing energy use, while others (such as
RCI-3, RCI-5, and RCI-6) are defined by addressing a specific type of energy use or supply.
Policies were compared in terms of the type of energy use they target and the energy reduction
measures each is expected to implement. Overlaps were identified and quantified by sector (RCI or
government), type of energy use targeted (water heating, space heating, etc.), and measure (e.g.,
high efficiency air conditioning).
•

RCI-1 (Improved Building Codes) is a regulatory policy that is assumed to take precedence over
voluntary and incentive options. The GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from this
policy are not reduced to account for overlaps with other policies.

•

RCI-2 (“Beyond Code” Energy Efficiency) is a combined electricity and fuels incentive policy.
The policy is assumed to be incremental to, or occur on top of, the reductions that are achieved
from the RCI-1 building codes policy. The GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits
from this policy are not reduced to account for overlaps with other policies.

•

RCI-3 (Expand Electric Utility DSM Programs) overlaps are estimated at the measure level.
RCI-3 and RCI-2 are both policies that offer incentives to end users to purchase more efficient
equipment. RCI-3 provides incentives for electricity measures, such as ENERGY STAR
appliances, weatherization, and building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC)
measures. We estimate that these measures and targeted markets (end users) are similar to those
expected to be provided incentives under RCI-2. Because of the similarity in measures and
targets, the GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from electric efficiency under this
policy are reduced by 75% to account for overlaps with RCI-2. This estimate is conservative, to
ensure that GHG reductions under RCI-3 are not double counted with RCI-2.

•

RCI-5 (Financing for Combined Heat and Power [CHP]) is a supply-side policy
recommendation that is quantified according to the expected demand for thermal resources in
the commercial and industrial sectors. More efficient use of hot water from improved
commercial building heating and cooling or domestic use of hot water under RCI-2 could
reduce the supply of commercial CHP. Commercial GHG reductions and associated costs or
G-3

benefits from electric efficiency under this policy are reduced by 20% to account for potential
overlaps with RCI-2. The KCAPC did not develop an RCI policy specifically to improve
industrial energy efficiency that could reduce the supply of industrial CHP. Therefore, industrial
GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from the CHP policy are not reduced to
account for overlaps with other policies.
•

RCI-6 (Financing for Renewable Energy) is a supply-side policy recommendation that is
quantified according to the expected demand in the residential and commercial sectors. More
efficient use of hot water from improved building heating and cooling or domestic use of hot
water under RCI-2 could reduce the supply of residential and commercial solar thermal, but
these effects are separate from the installation of new solar hot water units. GHG reductions and
associated costs or benefits from the solar photovoltaic element of this policy are not reduced to
account for overlaps with other policies.

•

RCI-7 (Government Lead by Example) is applied only to government energy consumption,
while other policies address residential and commercial buildings. Government high-efficiency
building standards typically show little overlap with utility programmatic investments and are
additional to code improvements. The GHG reductions and associated costs or benefits from
this policy are not reduced to account for overlaps with other policies.

•

RCI-9 (Building Commissioning, Benchmarking, and Labeling) is composed of two main
elements: commissioning as well as building audits that are the basis for benchmarking and
labeling.

Commissioning new buildings is assumed to be a part of the “above code” or green building portion
of RCI-2. Similarly, recommissioning existing buildings is a cost-effective program to reduce
energy consumption that is assumed to fall under the retrofit element of RCI-2. Therefore, the GHG
reductions and associated costs or benefits from the commissioning and recommissioning elements
of the policy are reduced by 100% to account for overlaps with RCI-2. The net effect of the overlap
reductions is to reduce GHG mitigation from the policy by 85% by 2030, as most of the reductions
from the policy are estimated to result from commissioning and recommissioning.
While building audits are part of most residential energy efficiency programs, their penetration
without the home sales element of this policy would be limited. A similar argument can be made for
the limited penetration of commercial audits in the reference case. The GHG reductions and
associated costs or benefits from the auditing element of this policy are not reduced to account for
overlaps with other policies.
Overlaps Between Sectors
There are several potential overlaps between RCI and other sectors. These potential overlaps are
discussed qualitatively here. The first is that electricity energy efficiency investments from the suite
of RCI policy recommendations reduce electricity demand. Reducing future electricity sales makes
it easier for regulated entities to meet a target for renewable electricity sales as a percentage of total
sales. Such a renewable electricity target is being developed under ES-7, and the demand reductions
from RCI would likely make compliance with the target more cost-effective and easier to attain.
AFW-3 (On-Farm Energy Production and Efficiency Improvements) targets energy-efficient
electric pumps, lighting, and electric drying on farms. We assume that agricultural electric energy
G-4

efficiency is largely separate from energy efficiency measures in the RCI sector. While there are
some potential overlaps in the agricultural building energy efficiency measures of AFW-3 and RCI2 (Beyond Code Energy Efficiency), we believe that any potential double counting of energy
efficiency savings (and associated GHG reductions) are more than adequately accounted for in the
75% decrease in GHG reductions from RCI-3 due to its potential overlaps with RCI-2.
Finally, an additional feedback is that certain Energy Supply policies will have the effect of
reducing the GHG emissions associated with electricity generation. In this case, RCI policies that
target electricity use will have a reduced ability to deliver GHG emissions. The RCI analysis
assumes that current and future electricity generation is largely coal-fired. If considerable fuel
switching occurs from coal to cleaner sources of electricity, then the GHG electricity-related
reductions from the RCI policies would be reduced. This impact has not been reflected in the
analysis.
Figure RCI-1 shows the costs and supplies of GHG reductions from the RCI sector in the summary
table above. These estimates are adjusted for overlaps. Figure RCI-1 shows reductions of about 375
million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) with cost savings or low costs to the
state.

Electricity Savings from Integrated Policy Recommendations
Estimated savings from the combined policies (net of overlaps) for 2030 for electricity are
estimated at 10,064 gigawatt-hours (GWh). This includes energy efficiency savings under RCI-1
Improved Building Codes, RCI-2 “Beyond-Code” Efficiency, RCI-3 Electric Energy Efficiency,
RCI-7 Government Lead by Example, and RCI-9 Building Commissioning and Recommissioning.
This represents about 7.7% of the 130,500-GWh forecasted sales in 2030 according to the Kentucky
inventory and forecast. 1 In addition to these demand reductions, RCI-5 CHP switches an estimated
6,300 GWh from central station electricity generation to distributed commercial and industrial CHP
electricity generation.

GHG Reductions from Recent State Actions
Recent actions are accounted for in the summary table as policies that have been enacted, but that
are not in the reference case Kentucky inventory and forecast. Recent actions are defined as
legislative or executive orders that have been enacted in Kentucky by November 2010. The impacts
from federal actions are assumed to be included in the reference case forecast.
The first recent action that needs to be included is Kentucky House Bill (HB) 2 of 2009, which
requires:
(1) Beginning July 1, 2009, require that all construction or renovation of public buildings for which fifty
percent (50%) or more of the total capital cost is paid by the Commonwealth shall be designed and
constructed, or renovated, to meet the high-performance building standards established in Section 5 of this
Act….
(2) Require that all building leases entered into by the Commonwealth or any of its agencies on and after July
1, 2018, shall meet the high-performance building standards….
(3) Incorporate ENERGY STAR-qualified products in state agency procurements to the extent economically
feasible using a life-cycle cost analysis. 2

G-6

We quantify the lease renewal and efficient appliance portions of HB 2 that are not included in
RCI-7. Only the GHG reductions associated with the new construction portion of HB 2 are
considered to overlap with RCI-7, and thus are eliminated from the RCI-7 quantification. The total
GHG reductions associated with HB 2 in Kentucky are listed in Table RCI-2.
Kentucky’s utilities have been pursuing limited demand-side management (DSM) programs for
some time. For the analysis of RCI-3, we assume that existing residential electric DSM programs
are equal to 0.25% of load over the 2010–2030 period and are not in the reference case forecast;
therefore, they need to be treated as recent actions. 3 This estimate is based on the activities for one
investor-owned utility (IOU), and may not be representative of statewide activities. Nonetheless,
the important thing is that potential DSM activities are included in recent actions and are not being
double counted in RCI-3. Commercial electric DSM programs are assumed be funded at lower
levels. Thus, they are adequately incorporated into the electric utility load growth forecasts used for
the Kentucky Inventory and Forecast, and are not treated as recent actions. The fuels forecast for
Kentucky is based on growth estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA’s)
Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) 2009. The fuels forecast includes historical improvements in energy
efficiency, so fuel DSM programs are not treated as recent actions in this analysis. See the RCI-3
quantification results section for the assumptions used to calculate GHG reductions from recent
DSM actions in the electric sector.

RCI-1. Improve Building Codes for Energy Efficiency, Coupled with Improved
Energy Code Training and Enforcement

Policy Description
Building energy codes specify minimum energy efficiency requirements for new buildings or for
existing buildings undergoing a major renovation. Given the lifetime of buildings, amending state
building codes to include minimum energy efficiency requirements and periodically updating
energy efficiency codes could provide long-term GHG savings. Kentucky can improve energy
codes that go beyond HVAC systems to include efficiency gains, such as designs to reduce lighting
needs, electric lighting design, building envelope design, and integrated building design strategies.
Building codes, such as fire, structural, and electrical codes, were originally developed to address
building conditions and safeguard occupants; building officials have thought of themselves as
protectors of the public. Energy codes are a relatively recent addition to the family of building
codes and do not have the same immediate connection to public safety. Therefore, many
jurisdictions have given them lower priority when allocating resources. Energy codes are
increasingly being relied upon to address health issues, energy supply concerns, and climate
change. Accordingly, officials will need to put building code enforcement on a par with that of
traditional codes.
State and local governments must communicate that energy code enforcement is an equal partner in
the family of building codes. They must also allocate sufficient resources to allow code officials to
enforce the energy code requirements on a level playing field with fire, life, and safety codes.
Building codes are generally funded and enforced by permit fees, which average less than 1% of
construction costs.
Adequate training of building plan reviewers and building inspectors is key to the success of
building codes, as is appropriate enforcement capability. Unless these functions are adequately
funded and staffed with qualified personnel, the full value of building codes will not be realized.
Accordingly, the state’s building code efforts should include an education and outreach program for
building inspectors to encourage incorporation in inspection protocols of energy efficiency and GHG
emission reduction considerations.
Policy Design
Goals/Levels
•

Expand enforcement of building energy codes.

•

Adopt national codes with amendments as appropriate.

•

Achieve targeted improvements in energy efficiency through educational programs for building
inspectors and code enforcement officials to ensure that the existing codes are implemented and
enforced.

•

As a longer-term goal (e.g., ~2030), consider the benefits and shortcomings of basing the state’s
energy codes on units of carbon emitted, rather than units of energy consumed.
G-8

Timing
•

Expand adoption and enforcement efforts of building energy code requirements immediately.

•

Update Kentucky energy codes within one year to coincide with the most recent version of the
national codes, and keep them updated to the latest standards.

•

Coordinate training of building code officials with the adoption and enforcement of the new
codes.

Parties Involved: The Kentucky Department of Housing, Building and Construction (DHBC) and
local jurisdictions as applicable, with input from the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet
(KEEC) and Finance and Administration Cabinet; building designers; builders and contractors;
building inspectors; mortgage lenders.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
As noted above, implementation would primarily occur through the adoption and enforcement of
updated building codes by the involved parties. Training and education efforts would occur in
parallel.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

Training workshops of industry personnel and public awareness efforts are contemplated under
a grant administered by DHBC through the Department for Energy Development and
Independence (DEDI).

•

Compliance with model energy codes (e.g., 2009 International Energy Conservation Code
[IECC] and American Society of Heating, Air Conditioning, and Refrigeration Engineers
[ASHRAE] 90.1_2007) is scattered in all but a few states. In response, the International Code
Council (ICC) and the Building Codes Assistance Project (BCAP) have put forth an initiative
and partnership called the Energy Code Ambassadors Program (ECAP). One important barrier
to improved code compliance is a general lack of local and state infrastructure and experience in
enforcing energy codes. Using national and regional energy code experts as mentors or
“ambassadors” to assist state and local code officials in developing and implementing effective
enforcement/compliance approaches will provide needed support and technical assistance. The
ambassadors will provide support and energy code expertise, including infield guidance and/or
training, to the code enforcement community. Further, ambassadors will be adept in using ICC,
BCAP, U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and other resources and will act as grassroots code
adoption and implementation representatives, as needed. Further, ambassadors will provide
advocacy support in their states for code adoption and updates. Kentucky is one of four states
selected to participate in this pilot program, which will be coordinated by DHBC, the state code
enforcement authority.

•

Kentucky has formed a High-Performance Building Advisory Committee to set aggressive
energy consumption standards for state buildings as part of the state’s government-lead-byexample efforts.

G-9

•

By accepting American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) State Energy
Program funding and submitting letters assuring DOE that it will comply with the terms of
Section 410, Kentucky has committed to do three things:
o Adopt a residential building energy code that meets or exceeds the 2009 IECC;
o Adopt a commercial building energy code that meets or exceeds the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI)/ASHRAE/Illuminating Engineering Society of North America
(IESNA) Standard 90.1–2007; and
o Develop and implement a plan, including active training and enforcement provisions, to
achieve 90% compliance with the target codes by 2017, including measuring current
compliance each year. 4

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
•

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary gas reduced by avoided electricity generation from fossil
fuel sources, but trace amounts of methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions are also
avoided.

•

CO2 is the primary gas reduced by avoided fossil fuel combustion in the RCI sectors, but trace
amounts of CH4 emissions are also avoided.

Quantification Methods: The analysis first calculates gross costs, which include the incremental
capital, labor, and fuel (if appropriate) costs of the efficient technology over the assumed baseline
technology. Administrative (program, evaluation, marketing, and outreach) costs are also included
in the costs of RCI energy efficiency. These cost assumptions are listed in Tables RCI-1-3 and RCI1-4. Next, gross benefits from avoided energy expenditures are calculated. Net cash flows (costs or
benefits) are then calculated, which are gross costs-gross benefits. Finally, the net present value
(NPV) of this stream of net cash flows is derived.

G-11

Gross Costs
The gross costs in each year are derived as follows:
•

The quantity of energy savings (gigawatt-hours [GWh]/billion British thermal units [BBtu]) for
each year is determined from the goal and timing sections of each policy recommendation.

•

The above costs of the incremental energy-efficient equipment is multiplied times the quantity
of energy savings (GWh/BBtu) assumed mitigated in each year. This gives the total gross cost
of the policy recommendation in each year.

Gross Benefits
The gross benefits in each year are derived as follows:
•

The avoided prices of energy, which are the avoided energy expenditures (or bill savings) from
the RCI policies. These avoided prices are listed in Table RCI-1-2.

•

The quantity of energy (GWh/BBtu) used to calculate the gross benefits is the same amount of
energy as calculated for gross costs above.

•

The gross benefit is the avoided energy price multiplied by the quantity of energy assumed
mitigated in each year.

Net Costs or Benefits
The net costs or benefits in each year are derived as follows:
•

Gross benefits are subtracted from gross costs in each year through 2025 to give a net cash flow
for each time period. Negative values represent positive economic cash flows.

Net Present Value
•

The NPV of this stream of cash flows is calculated using a 5% real discount rate to estimate a
discounted, lump sum cost (benefit) in $2006 to the state from the program in 2010 (assuming
the relevant 2012–2030 implementation schedule).

The building code analysis begins with the new construction growth rate for each sector and applies
this rate to the relevant electric sales forecast. The percentage of electricity use that falls under code
buildings in each year is calculated and then multiplied by the cumulative electricity savings
percentage from assumed improvements in efficiency in future energy codes. Electricity savings
from major retrofits are then included, and losses from noncompliance are subtracted. Fuel savings
from the code policy is derived at the ratio of fuel use to electricity use for each building type.
Key Assumptions
•

The direct emissions factor for avoided CO2 emissions intensity for electricity is approximately
1.03 metric tons per megawatt-hour (t/MWh) for all years, and is derived from a consumptionbased carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) forecast for each year divided by MWh forecasted
sales. This approach includes electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) losses in emission
intensity. The full-fuel-cycle emissions factor is assumed to be 5% higher than the direct factor.
As coal is the source of nearly all electricity generation in Kentucky, the full fuel cycle for coal
is used, which is 5% higher than the direct emissions factor.
G-12

•

Table RCI-1-2 lists the fuel emissions factor assumptions. The direct emission factors come
from EIA, and the full-fuel-cycle emissions are in addition to the direct emissions developed for
New York from the GREET (Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in
Transportation) model. 5

Existing code enforcement rates are 50%, rising to 90% by 2019 under ARRA. Residential
compliance entails plan reviews and inspections by local officials. This activity is part of the
baseline, given it is a condition of ARRA (2009) funding.

•

The baseline energy consumption forecast is derived from the 2010 AEO, which assumes a
slow adoption of residential and commercial building codes.

•

The baseline for this analysis is that Kentucky adopts the 2009 residential and 2007 commercial
codes by the start of RCI-1 in 2012. It also assumes that Kentucky updates these codes to the
most recent vintage in 2021 as part of the baseline activity.

Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) (2009). For example, the fixed costs for
residential efficiency equal (0.15 * $5.29) = $0.79/MMBtu. Total costs of residential are thus $5.29
+ $0.79 or $6.08/MMBtu.
The energy savings assumptions for RCI-1 are listed in Table RCI-1-6. The savings from building
energy codes are driven by estimated electric energy demand reductions. Efficiency savings for
natural gas, fuel oil, and other fuels are estimated by their usage in each sector relative to electricity.
For example, in the residential sector on a total Btu basis approximately 28% more natural gas is
used than electricity. Therefore, an improvement in a building energy code cycle that reduced
electricity demand by 10% would result in a 12.8% reduction in natural gas for the residential
sector and a 6.35% reduction in natural gas for the commercial sector.

RCI-2. Promote, Encourage, and Provide Incentives for
“Beyond-Code” Efficiency in All Building Characteristics and Systems
That Impact Energy Consumption

Policy Description
This policy provides incentives and targets to induce the owners and developers of new buildings to
improve the efficiency of the use of energy and other resources in those buildings, along with
provisions for raising target levels periodically and providing resources to building industry
professionals to help achieve the desired building performance. This policy can include elements to
encourage the improvement and review of energy use goals over time. Additionally, it can support
flexibility in contracting arrangements to encourage integrated energy- and resource-efficient
design, construction, and renovation. Incentives could include low-cost loans for investments in
energy efficiency, tax credits, expedited plan review permits, and feebates for design professionals.
Improving the energy efficiency design of buildings will have an immediate and ongoing impact on
reducing GHG emissions.
For the remainder of RCI-2, we will use the base energy use intensities from ANSI/ASHRAE/
IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 for various building types in climate zone 4A, as defined by DOE
Executive Order (EO) 430.2B.
Policy Design
Goals
• Provide tiered incentives for energy efficiency in new buildings that achieve a reduction in
energy use relative to the base established per the DOE EO 430.2B energy standard for
commercial buildings and the 2009 IECC for residential buildings through certification by a
design professional or a nationally recognized third-party-verified green building certification
system for commercial or residential buildings (e.g., Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED), ASHRAE/U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC)/IESNA Standard 189, or
Green Globes New Construction).
•

Reward projects where minimum energy efficiency exceeds ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard
90.1-2004 benchmark levels 11 by the amounts shown in Table RCI-2-1.

This benchmark applies base energy use intensities from ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 for various
building types in climate zone 4A as defined by U.S. DOE Executive Order 430.2B. See

Provide projects and project teams appropriate incentives for achieving the appropriate levels
above. Give projects and project teams that surpass the above goals an additional incentive for
every 5% greater efficiency achieved beyond the above goals. In 2025 and 2030, once the team
has made the project as energy efficient as possible (i.e., 100%), give the project and project
team all aforementioned incentives.

•

Require participating organizations or individuals to calculate, monitor, and report the costs and
actual performance of energy efficiency improvements, as well as annual GHG emissions.
Compare the performance of energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings against a
regional average of similar building types.

Timing: Legislation may be required for implementation. Develop any necessary legislation in
2011, and implement the incentives policy in 2012.
Parties Involved: Legislative Research Commission (LRC), Commonwealth of Kentucky Finance
Cabinet, DHBC, developers, builders and contractors, building owners, energy service companies,
building material suppliers, recycled building material sellers, design professionals, and home

RCI-3. Expand Utility DSM Programs for Electricity

Policy Description
Note: This policy recommendation was developed jointly with the Energy Supply TWG as policy
ES-2.
Demand-side management (DSM), energy efficiency education, programs, pilots, or goals for
reduced electricity consumption call for actions that influence the quantity and/or patterns of use of
energy consumed by end users. This policy recommendation focuses on increasing investment in
electricity DSM/energy efficiency through innovative actions developed and implemented by
utilities, community partners, and customers. The ultimate goal is to provide tools, information,
assistance, and knowledge that will help customers manage their energy consumption more
efficiently and reduce their consumption.
Policy Design
Given the current cost of electricity in Kentucky and the lack of consensus in the U.S. House and
Senate on increasing the costs of electricity through the establishment of a price on carbon,
renewable portfolio standards, efficiency standards, or clean energy standards, the most costeffective method of preparing the Commonwealth for increased energy efficiency and DSM is to
increase education and the number of efficiency/DSM programs and pilot projects that provide
customers with the tools and information they need to better manage their energy consumption.
The current rate structure for utilities in Kentucky creates a business environment where additional
energy efficiency and conservation measures may have a negative financial impact for utilities.
Historically, utility rate structures encourage the sale of power. To align energy efficiency and
conservation incentives with the utilities’ business model, Kentucky should examine alternative rate
structures that equalize the incentive for utilities to invest in cost-effective energy efficiency, with
the incentive to invest in new supply resources.
Goals
•

On a collaborative basis, by June 2011, develop a consortium of IOUs, electric cooperatives,
and municipal utilities to work with DEDI and the Public Service Commission (PSC) to develop
rate mechanisms and remove regulatory barriers so that utilities are better able to invest in DSM
and energy efficiency programs. Considerations for this recommendation could include, but are
not limited to, corporate tax incentives, sustainable building tax credits, green building
incentives, green building standards for state facilities, energy efficiency bond programs,
personal tax incentives, sales tax incentives, lease purchase programs, grant programs, and loan
programs.

•

By January 2012 have in place a regulatory environment that provides a mechanism and
procedure for investment in DSM and energy efficiency. Investment in DSM and energy
efficiency may include, but is not limited to:
o Consumer and member education

G-24

o Consumer and member focus groups
o Pilot programs to explore and test creative and innovative opportunities
- SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) systems
- Communication systems
- Advanced Volt/Var control

- Distributed generation pilots, where consumers work collaboratively to implement
economic alternative power supply systems, such as:


Solar water-heating systems



Heat pump water-heating systems



Geothermal HVAC and water-heating systems



Wind power systems



Biomass power supply systems



Net-zero-energy homes



Electric vehicle/utility interconnection systems

- Energy storage systems
- Weatherization, HVAC upgrades, and ENERGY STAR appliance upgrade pilot
programs in collaboration with finance and community networks to provide innovative
funding mechanisms to assist customers to finance their energy efficiency efforts.
•

By June 2011, have DEDI in a collaborative effort with the PSC and the state’s utilities. Based
on empirical studies of nationwide energy efficiency and DSM programs, determine the costs of
electricity where participation in energy efficiency and DSM has become commonplace. In
addition, determine the impact of DSM on energy consumption in Kentucky as well as
G-25

nationwide. Charts identifying the aggregated DSM energy savings from filed programs from
1995 through 2015 would provide a good historical basis to assist in determining a reasonable
policy going forward.
•

By January 2012, have pilot programs and consumer education in place at all utilities in the
Commonwealth.

•

By January 2014, have advanced the pilot programs to make energy efficiency/DSM
opportunities available to all consumers in the Commonwealth. Beginning in 2014 and running
to 2030, consider targets for DSM GHG reductions, pending additional research on experience
in other states with comparable demographics and energy price points.

•

As the cost of electricity increases to the level that causes significant energy efficiency/DSM
results, have a strong, viable consumer education program and an energy efficiency/DSM plan
in place at all utilities in the Commonwealth.

Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: IOUs, municipals, cooperatives, DEDI, PSC, community action groups, financial
organizations, environmental groups, and DSM equipment manufacturers. It is the intent to work in
a collaborative process, to properly align the roles of these parties.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
DEDI will convene a collaborative team made up of all of the stakeholders identified above to work
in a consensus decision-making process to achieve these goals. New legislation may be required to
implement resulting recommendations, especially any relating to well-established PSC
requirements.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

Many Kentucky utilities have DSM funds and programs in place for residential and commercial
customers.

•

DSM is a component of Kentucky’s Energy Efficiency Resource Standard (EERS), one of four
major action items in Kentucky’s proposed energy strategy. 12

•

Government Lead by Example (GLE) is also one of the four major action items in Kentucky’s
energy strategy; the recommended targets are 15% reduction in energy consumption from 2009
levels by 2015 and 25% by 2025.

•

DSM and education programs begin in 2012 and reach full implementation by 2015, when they
achieve incremental annual load reductions of 1% of the forecasted load. Load reductions occur
for all RCI sectors at the same implementation rate. Load reductions from the programs for
2016–2030 are at the 2015 rate. Table RCI-3-2 presents the assumed short-term implementation
schedule for load reductions.

The 1% annual reduction for 2015–2030 is moderate compared to what other states with low
electricity prices have implemented for aggressive electricity DSM programs. As a point of
reference, Kentucky’s all-sector average electricity price for 2007 was $58.40/MWh according
to EIA. 13
o Iowa’s IOUs are scheduled to achieve incremental annual load reductions from DSM of
1.4% of load by 2013, up from 0.8% in 2007. 14 Iowa’s all-sector average electricity price
for 2007 was $68.30/MWh.
o Idaho Power spends about 4.7% of revenues on energy efficiency, in spite of low electricity
prices. 15 Idaho’s all-sector average electricity price for 2007 was $50.07/MWh.
o The Arkansas Governor’s Commission on Global Warming recommended meeting all new
electricity load growth (about 1.7%/year) through DSM programs. 16 Arkansas’ all-sector
average electricity price for 2007 was $69.60/MWh.

Considerable caution is necessary in development of energy reduction targets. It should be
recognized that achieving any level of energy savings requires consumer behavior change and
acceptance. The 1% outlined in the current document should be used with caution, as it is
unknown what incentives are necessary to motivate Kentuckians to fully participate in energy
efficiency programs sufficient to achieve a 1% reduction year-over-year. Thus, this policy
recommends that the evaluation process be lengthy enough to thoroughly vet the concerns of all
participants, and that the setting of any policy/targets be cautious to allow for adequate time for
adoption by Kentucky residents.
Technology Costs
•

Technology costs can vary widely, and emerging technology contains risks that are not fully
understood.

•

Targets must be set while considering market acceptance (consumer behavior changes) and
development (to maturity) of technologies.

Rebound Effect
•

Depending on price elasticity of demand, the rebound from pricing changes could be
substantial, and needs to be understood completely in relation to overall efficiency goals.

Participation
•

Out-of-pocket expenses and incentives of consumers should be considered, as they may be the
key to successful participation.

•

Predicting consumer behavior changes related to energy savings may be difficult.

Regulatory Process/Approval
•

The Kentucky PSC is required to adhere to well-established requirements in assessing costeffectiveness. Modification of these procedures, if needed, may require new statutory
authorization.

Marketing, Including Consumer Awareness, School Curriculum,
Truth-in-Advertising, Technical Information and Support
(e.g., How to Do GHG Inventories, Rationales for Action, etc.)

Note: This policy recommendation bears similarities with Cross-Cutting Issues TWG policy
recommendation CCI-2. Consideration and, if appropriate, adoption and implementation of RCI-4
and CCI-2 should take into account these similarities.
Policy Description
Education in this policy recommendation falls under three categories:
•

Consumer awareness and education.

•

School curriculum.

•

Truth-in-advertising campaigns.

The ultimate effectiveness of emission reduction activities depends in many cases on providing
information and education to consumers regarding the energy and GHG emission implications of
consumer choices. Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a broad awareness of climate
change issues and effects (including co-benefits, such as clean air and public health) among the
state’s citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in actions to reduce GHG emissions
in their personal and professional lives. Public education and outreach efforts should integrate with
and build upon existing outreach efforts involving climate change and related issues in the state.
Ultimately, education and outreach will be the foundation for the long-term success of all of the
mitigation actions proposed, as well as those that may evolve in the future.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Develop consumer education courses and outreach programs for GHG emission reductions.

•

Provide information and education to present and future consumers in all levels of education—
elementary, secondary, college, university, and community colleges.

•

Develop guidelines to ensure that factual and accurate information regarding GHG emission
implications is provided to consumers through a truth-in-advertising campaign targeting
advertising of energy-consuming products.

•

Develop consumer product programs that may include education, incentives, retailer trainer,
marketing, and promotion.

•

Utilize tools, such as Web-based calculators, to assist residents, businesses, and communities
with developing GHG inventories and to evaluate and act upon their GHG inventory results.

Timing: By 2012, put the education awareness programs in place, begin outreach programs, and
evaluate school curriculum areas to make sure they include GHG awareness.

RCI-5. Financing Programs and Incentives for Energy Efficiency and CHP
(PBF, Revolving Loans, etc.)

Note: This policy recommendation bears similarities with recommendation RCI-6 and CrossCutting Issues TWG recommendation CCI-7. Consideration and, if appropriate, adoption and
implementation of RCI-5, RCI-6, and CCI-7 should take into account these similarities.
Policy Description
Financing programs need to be designed to eliminate a major barrier to private investment in energy
efficiency, conservation, or combined heat and power (CHP) measures installed on buildings: the
large up-front investment. By removing this barrier, building owners are more likely to pursue
building-scale energy efficiency retrofits and/or CHP installations.
A number of programs and incentives that have been successful in other jurisdictions could be
designed and implemented in Kentucky as part of this policy recommendation. 17 Green mortgages
roll the costs of energy efficiency or CHP measures into new or refinanced mortgages and allow the
amortization of the costs of the efficient equipment to better match future utility bill savings from
the equipment. Public benefit funds provide a source of financing for all types of sales rebate
programs to “buy down” the incremental costs of CHP and/or energy-efficient equipment. State
income tax credits and property tax credits can also provide a source of funding to households and
firms to purchase energy efficient equipment and/or CHP. Energy loan programs, financed by state
issued bonds, provide low-interest loans and can also reduce the large up front investments
associated with energy-efficient equipment and/or CHP. Finally, Property Assessed Clean Energy
(PACE) financing programs work through the creation of a public loan fund at the municipal level
that is directed solely to financing energy efficiency and/or CHP installations. The repayment of the
funds takes place annually along with the building owner’s property tax bill, giving PACE
payments the same treatment as taxes for lien priority purposes. 18
This policy pairs with RCI-6, which provides for similar financing mechanisms to encourage
investments in renewable energy by building owners.
Figures RCI-5-1 and RCI-5-2 show the industries and sectors that are the sources of CHP supply in
the state. The estimates for the Southeast region are used for Kentucky.

17

See www.dsireusa.org for examples of funding programs in other jurisdictions.

18

On May 5, 2010, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—the U.S. government-chartered entities that collectively back around
half of the mortgages in the United States—issued “lender guidance letters,” which suggested that PACE programs
were incompatible with their mortgages because they were left in a subordinate debt position. As a result, PACE
implementation has slowed or stalled nationally (since this policy recommendation was crafted), pending resolution of
this issue.

Policy Design
Goals: Address the significant opportunity in Kentucky for increased energy efficiency measures
and CHP generation. Numerous ways exist to provide incentives for the adoption of energy
efficiency measures, including rebates funded through public benefits funds or other mechanisms,
low-cost loans provided through revolving loan funds, providing greater security to lenders through

concerning what kinds of improvements qualify for funding. For the purposes of quantification,
CHP projects in Kentucky are assumed to be financed by a wide range of mechanisms that reduce
market barriers to CHP deployment and result in the CHP policy goals being achieved. Sample
assumptions, detailed below, illustrate potential GHG reductions and costs/savings.
Timing: See assumptions below.
Parties Involved: Building owners, mortgage lenders, local governments, state and local building
officials.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
A variety of implementation approaches are possible, as discussed above.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
A Public Benefit Fund (PBF) is a component of the EERS proposed as part of Kentucky’s 7-Point
Strategy for Energy Independence. 21 Tax incentives are cited as a possible component as well.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, N2O, CH4: Displaces emissions from fossil-based, central-station, electricity generation.
Local emissions of criteria pollutants can increase due to the distributed nature of generation,
depending on the efficiency of the avoided boiler and other considerations.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings

institutional CHP installations have accounted for the majority of new installations in recent years.

$/MWh cost for each CHP technology in each year to derive the cost. The $/MWh cost for each
CHP technology is a function of the unit heat rate, operating and maintenance costs, and fuel costs.
Benefits are calculated by multiplying the assumed avoided electricity $/MWh cost by the above
number of linearly deployed MWh for each CHP sector in each year. Avoided boiler expenditures

which is then discounted at 5% from 2010 to 2030 to estimate NPV. The NPV value is then divided
by the cumulative number of MMtCO2 reduced (net of the CHP unit’s emissions) to arrive at the
$/tCO2e value. These and other factors and assumptions used in quantifying this policy

•

Financing mechanisms are required to fully develop the CHP supplies in the state. The program
and administrative costs of these financing mechanisms are not included in the analysis.

•

The real financing rate for all CHP projects is assumed to be 8.5%.

•

CHP potential for commercial applications in 2025 is assumed to be 917 megawatts (MW), and
industrial potential is 3,390 MW. These are the 2005 MW potentials identified in Hedman
(2005), and are assumed to be unchanged over the period. This value is consistent with Hedman
(2009), which quotes an Oak Ridge National Laboratory study that estimates 3,000–8,000 MW
of CHP supply for Kentucky. 23

•

CHP potential is installed in equal annual amounts (linearly) from the start of the program in
2012 until 2025. The 2025–2030 capacities remain constant at 2025 levels.

The T&D charges for Kentucky Utilities Company are representative of these charges

Key Uncertainties
•

The costs presented here would be better presented as a range to reflect the uncertainties
associated with future capital costs and heat rates of CHP technologies, as well as fuel price
forecast uncertainties.

•

Kentucky has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country, which hinders market-based
deployment of CHP. Kentucky also has relatively expensive natural gas. However, the avoided
CO2 resource assumption in Kentucky is high, due to coal-fired electricity generation. The
economic costs and benefits from CHP are heavily reliant on the assumptions of avoided
electricity and natural gas costs, as well as CO2 emissions.

•

Some of Kentucky’s key industries (e.g., aluminum) may be less amenable to CHP applications
due to the nature of their production processes.

•

Public concerns could arise over the use of PACE or PBF funding for private industrial
facilities.

•

Financing through utilities—and repayment on the utility bill—could also be an option besides
the PACE approach. In this case, however, steps to insulate the utility from the financial risk of
default would need to be incorporated.

These MW installations in each year are converted to MWh based on each technology’s capacity
factor. The costs of the policy recommendation are the generation costs of each type of solar PV.
The benefits from the policy recommendation are the avoided electricity expenditures ($/MWh
forecasted avoided cost of electricity multiplied by the distributed generation in MWh) for the
residential and commercial sectors in each year. The NPV of the costs less benefits is then
calculated.

Key Uncertainties
•

The costs of this policy recommendation would be better presented as a range to reflect the
uncertainties associated with future capital costs, performance of renewable energy
technologies, and fuel price forecast uncertainties.

•

Kentucky has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country, which hinders market-based
deployment of renewable energy. However, the avoided CO2 resource assumption in Kentucky
is high due to coal-fired electricity generation. The economic costs and benefits from renewable
energy are heavily reliant on the assumptions of avoided electricity costs, as well as CO2
emissions.

•

The federal 30% investment tax credit is scheduled to run through 2018. It may not be extended
to 2030.

•

Biomass production could also be included as a renewable energy policy, but this technology is
being assessed as part of the AFW-2 policy recommendation.

•

Financing through utilities—and repayment on the utility bill—could also provide a financing
mechanism. In this case, however, steps to insulate the utility from the financial risk of default
would need to be incorporated.

Additional Benefits and Costs
•

Increased residential wood burning could lead to increases in emissions of criteria and other
pollutants, especially particulate matter.

RCI-7. Government Lead by Example (GLE) in Highly Efficient
State and Local Government Buildings

Policy Description
This policy provides energy efficiency targets for new construction of state and local government
buildings and renovation of existing state and local government buildings that are much higher than
code standards.
The Kentucky state government is a significant consumer of energy. The state owns about 66.9
million square feet of building space and leases an additional 5.2 million square feet. 29 Further,
local government buildings, such as courthouses, city halls, K–12 schools, and other facilities, are
not included in these figures. This policy recommendation estimates local government building
square footage at 60 million square feet, based on the 2003 U.S. EIA Commercial Building Energy
Consumption Survey. 30
The Kentucky General Assembly has made great strides in the maintenance of public buildings.
However, the potential for significant improvements and upgrades remains, reflecting opportunities
for more energy savings through more energy-efficient equipment and practices.
This policy requires the Kentucky Finance and Administration Cabinet (FAC) to improve the
efficiency of energy and other resources in public buildings that receive 50% or more of their
construction funding from the Commonwealth. Improving the energy efficiency of buildings will
provide immediate and ongoing energy savings and reduce GHG emissions.
The remainder of RCI-7 uses the base energy use intensities from ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard
90.1-2004 for various building types in climate zone 4A, as defined by DOE EO 430.2B.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Require new buildings to achieve a reduction in energy use relative to the base established per
the DOE EO 430.2B energy standard for commercial buildings and the 2009 IECC for
residential buildings through certification by a design professional or a nationally recognized
third-party-verified green building certification system for commercial or residential buildings
(e.g., LEED, ASHRAE/USGBC/IESNA Standard 189, or Green Globes New Construction).

•

This policy recommendation closely parallels RCI-2, but unlike that policy, it does not provide
for incentives to government, thereby raising the bar and establishing government leadership by
example.

Timing: Legislation may be required for implementation. Develop any necessary legislation in
2011, and implement the incentives policy in 2012.
Parties Involved: LRC, FAC, DHBC, developers, builders and contractors, building owners,
building material suppliers, recycled building material sellers, design professionals, and home
improvement stores.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
Public buildings that receive 50% or more of their construction funding from the Commonwealth
would be required, as a condition of receiving that funding, to meet the specified reductions from
benchmark energy use intensity.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
HB 2 (2008) also addresses state-owned, high-performance buildings.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2 is the primary gas reduced by avoided electricity generation from fossil fuel sources, but trace
amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions are also avoided.

Policy Description
Providing training, education, and outreach for builders, contractors, building operators, and code
officials encourages these building professionals to incorporate energy efficiency and GHG
emission reduction considerations in the conduct of their work. Education and training should be
mandatory and available to builders, contractors, and others involved in the construction of new
buildings and the retrofitting and renovation of existing buildings.
Policy Design
Goals
• Develop technical/professional education courses and outreach programs for GHG emission
reductions to increase the number of professionals trained in energy efficiency.
•

Achieve targeted improvements in energy efficiency through educational programs for builders,
building inspectors, and other building industry professionals to help ensure that the existing
codes are implemented and enforced.

Timing: By 2012, put the education/training policy in place and begin outreach programs.
Parties Involved: Consumers, retailers, manufacturers, technicians, and professionals in building
and related trades, code enforcement agencies and other government agencies (e.g., DBHC), trade
schools, and community colleges.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
Funding for education programs could come from a variety of sources, including professional
associations, matching grants from federal agencies, regional market energy efficiency
organizations, and energy efficiency surcharges paid by energy customers of from utilities and nonutilities.

RCI-9. Building Commissioning and Recommissioning, Including Energy Tracking
and Benchmarking, and Implement a Building Energy Labeling Program

Policy Description
Building commissioning is the process of verifying that systems perform as required for such areas
as energy consumption, system function, system operations, and systems maintenance.
Commissioning is the process applied to new construction projects or major renovations involving
capital expenditures. Existing building commissioning is the process applied to facilities in
operation to ensure proper operation and mitigate the impact of system degradation. Ongoing
commissioning is the continued implementation of preventive maintenance and performance
reviews in order to keep building systems operating efficiently, involving energy tracking and
benchmarking, system tune-ups, equipment and sensor calibrations, and staff retraining, among
other program elements.
The benefit of commissioning is to not only identify, but also address, operational issues that
impact energy consumption and system performance. The effort goes beyond energy analysis to
assess parameters, such as indoor environmental quality, equipment longevity, and system
maintenance, among others, as needed for the use and occupants of a given facility.
This policy recommendation would initiate commissioning efforts for publicly owned buildings.
The efforts would extend the scope of facilities to not only include capital construction, but also
systematically address existing buildings and facility management processes. The recommendation
would look at possible incentives for private facility owners who implement commissioning efforts
for new construction and renovations, existing buildings, and/or facility management processes.
This recommendation would require that findings related to commissioning identified in new
construction and renovation projects be addressed within the construction contract. For existing
building commissioning, the policy will require no- and low-cost findings to be addressed within
the project, while developing a plan to implement recommendations requiring capital expenditure
within a reasonable time period.
The integrity of the process will be defined by one of the following: the Building Commissioning
Association, ASHRAE, the Associated Air Balance Council Commissioning Group, the National
Environmental Balancing Bureau, or equivalent. Commissioning will be implemented by an
independent third-party commissioning authority certified by the associations listed above.
The minimum systems that will be commissioned include those that impact the energy consumption
of the facility, namely: HVAC, domestic hot water, lighting, renewable energy, building envelope,
all controls associated with listed systems, and additional systems as desired by the facility owner.
This recommendation would also initiate a program to inform building owners and operators,
tenants, and prospective buyers on the energy use of buildings, similar to a nutrition label on food
or miles-per-gallon ratings on cars. Examples include the Building Energy Quotient (or “Building

G-58

EQ”) program administered by ASHRAE 32 and Seattle’s Energy Use Benchmarking ordinance
#123226. 33
Energy Tracking and Benchmarking
Tracking and benchmarking the energy used in a building provides valuable information, not only
for comparative purposes between buildings of similar use classification, but also for identification
of buildings that have high and/or low performance, in order to determine efficient utilization of
energy and where resources need to be spent to reduce the energy costs. Benchmarking is
commonly used to identify the minimally acceptable performance of buildings.
Building Energy Labeling
Building energy labels provide information on the potential and actual energy usage of buildings,
give feedback to building owners and operators on how their buildings are performing, provide
insight into the value and potential long-term costs of a building and market-based forces to
influence energy efficiency investment opportunities, and can serve as a tool to provide for
differentiation in the marketplace.
Building energy disclosure benefits the Commonwealth by providing a mechanism for uniformly
measuring all building consumption, assists in the enforcement of building energy codes,
demonstrates responsible use of taxpayer funds when used in public buildings, protects consumers
from unknown future energy costs, and reduces energy use while allowing building owners to make
decisions about their property. One analysis 34 identified building energy disclosure as a more costeffective means for reducing energy use than codes. Mandatory labeling requirements are already in
place in the European Union, California, and Washington, DC.

The costs of new building labeling and benchmarking are assumed to be the same as an investment
grade audit. These costs include building energy simulation and certification. The savings from
new-building labeling and benchmarking is assumed to be 5%, which results from more efficient
equipment installations due to the labeling, as well as reduced market failures from landlord/tenant
and builder/operator agency problems.
Key Uncertainties
The costs of this policy recommendation would be better presented as a range to reflect the
uncertainties associated with future capital costs and performance of renewable energy
technologies, as well as fuel price forecast uncertainties.
Kentucky has some of the lowest electricity prices in the country, which hinders market-based
deployment of renewable energy. However, the avoided CO2 resource assumption in Kentucky is
high due to coal-fired electricity generation. The economic costs and benefits from renewable
energy are heavily reliant on the assumptions of avoided electricity costs, as well as CO2 emissions.

TLU-1. Bicycle and Pedestrian Comprehensive Plan and
Infrastructure Development

Policy Description
This policy would improve, construct, and promote sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and shared-use
paths to increase pedestrian and bicycle travel and thus reduce energy demands and GHG
emissions from automobile use.
Not so many years ago, most urban and suburban communities had sidewalks and many lowvolume, low-speed roads. Many rural communities had few sidewalks, but traffic was sparse and
moved at lower speeds than today. Increases in population and automobile use have resulted in
complex transportation systems that accommodate more traffic, while often ignoring the needs of
non-drivers. In response to a growing interest in walking and bicycling, planners and engineers
have developed sound guidance, which should be applied to all future bicycle and pedestrian
planning in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The following principles of this guidance ensure
maximum utilization of bicycle and pedestrian systems.
Principle #1: Local bicycle and pedestrian systems should provide safe and comfortable
facilities.
Research has contributed to our understanding of the needs of bicyclists and pedestrians. For
instance, there is unequivocal evidence that sidewalks protect pedestrians and contribute to
overall traffic safety. 2 Other research indicates that bicycle lanes increase the safety of bicyclists
on roadways between intersections and enhance a bicyclist’s sense of comfort in traffic. 3
Research is inconclusive as to whether bicycle lanes help or complicate movements at
intersections. To increase the perception of safety, careful design judgment is required for the
best application of many bicycle and pedestrian improvements. Areas that are inherently
unfriendly to bicyclists and pedestrians can be improved with practical design treatments, such as
with the addition of refuge islands and recessed stop lines at multi-lane crosswalks. The addition
of landscaping and well-maintained facilities also increases the sense of personal comfort and
safety for pedestrians and bicyclists.
Principle #2: Direct access to destinations and continuity through connected facilities
encourage the use of bicycle and pedestrian facilities.
Higher-density environments that provide sidewalks and Bicycle paths with short distances
between residential and commercial areas encourage walking and biking. Therefore, local
facilities should be connected with adjacent communities and state and regional trails.
Pedestrians and bicyclists need a continuous system of sidewalks/paths, Bicycle lanes, and
crossing opportunities that connect residential areas to schools, jobs, shopping, and other

services. There should be a proactive approach by government that will require sidewalks and
Bicycle paths in new developments and in-fill of missing links.
Additional considerations include:
•

Signing and re-striping of existing roadways and building off-road trails.

•

Accommodating the highest-priority destinations of local pedestrians and cyclists through
connected facilities.

•

Providing walkways and Bicycle paths to and within large developments and shelters for
transit users.

•

Implementing “Bicycles-on-Buses” programs, with bicycle parking available at transit
stations, shopping areas, schools, libraries, and parks.

Principle #3: The design and extent of a bicycle and pedestrian system should reflect the
needs of the community.
Communities differ in the type of bicycle and pedestrian facilities they require. The character of
a community, its existing infrastructure, and the needs of local bicyclists and pedestrians
determine the opportunities and constraints that define a reasonable approach to planning. Rural
communities that are characterized by relatively narrow roads with shoulders, limited public land
holdings, and long distances between farms and towns are quite different from urban areas with
high traffic volumes, curbed streets, and compact land uses. University and college towns, as
well, have special needs.
Opportunities for off-road trail facilities also vary by community location and type. Suburban
communities often fare well, especially if they have actively planned for open-space preservation
along rivers and abandoned railroad rights of way. They can develop inter-urban trails, create
local Bicycleway networks, and include sidewalks in new development.
Opportunities to create linear trails in urban areas are sometimes constrained by dense land use
and intense development pressure. However, in many cities, river walks and railroad corridors
have been developed as important public spaces. Cities usually have the advantage of a grid
street pattern and a relatively complete sidewalk system that offer alternatives for bicycle travel
and places to walk.
Principle #4: A bicycle and pedestrian plan should be implemented in phases over a
reasonable period of time.
The development of a bicycle system network and pedestrian circulation system will be
determined, in part, by input from the public, the configuration of the existing infrastructure and
linear corridors, and the availability of funding. It is important to select popular initial projects
that can be readily implemented. In addition, early projects should include low-cost items that
will make a difference to the community. Subsequent projects will include those that require
more coordination and a longer funding horizon.
It is advantageous to secure local funding from a variety of sources. Demonstrating that a plan
can be executed through a combination of already-planned transportation projects, various grant

H-4

programs, and local volunteer efforts builds support for allocating needed matching funds and
accessing local budgets.
Policy Design
Bicyclists want access to most of the same places as motorists, and they can legally use any
roads from which they are not officially banned. Many roads are usable for local bicycling, but
others are undesirable because of such factors as excessive traffic and high speeds. Bicyclists
have varying levels of comfort in traffic, depending on skill levels and aversion to risk. The
average adult bicyclist is uncomfortable in heavy, fast traffic and prefers an improved designated
bicycle facility system.
Pedestrian planning differs from bicycle planning partly because almost everyone walks.
Individuals from every age group and ability level use the pedestrian environment, and most
destinations need to be accessible by walking. People may be walking less these days, especially
in environments that lack pedestrian accommodations. However, many communities are
beginning to reverse this trend through pedestrian infrastructure improvements.4 This promotes
health, brings people in contact with their neighbors, and offers mobility to those who cannot or
choose not to drive.
A bicycle- and pedestrian-friendly community must provide facilities that allow people to
bicycle and walk safely. In some circumstances, roadways and developments must be retrofitted
to make bicycling and walking easier and more inviting. Facilities alone will not encourage a
change in behavior. Revitalizing downtowns and planning for density and mixed-use
development are equally important.
Goals

Increase walking and bicycling by making it a fun, comfortable, and accessible mode of
travel.

Implementation Mechanisms
Mechanism 1: Provide accessible, safe, and well-maintained bicycle and pedestrian
facilities along and across all streets.
•

Create a list of projects with a defensible, data-driven prioritization process that incorporates
public input, current and future demand, socioeconomic measures, and land use in order to
make the most of limited funds and to ensure that improvements best meet needs.

•

Involve pedestrians and cyclists in the identification of local land use needs by appointing
community pedestrian/cyclist advisory committees that meet regularly with local community
pedestrian/bicycle program managers to review progress and update land use plans.

•

Accommodate and improve bicycle and pedestrian access to and across bridges, railroads,
and state highways and through interchanges.

Mechanism 2: Institute policies and practices to ensure that Kentucky accommodates the
needs of bicyclists and pedestrians.
•

Adopt a statewide “complete streets” policy establishing the inclusion of bicycle and
pedestrian facilities in all new construction and reconstruction projects within the public right
of way.

•

Modify the annual KYTC traffic survey to collect data on pedestrian and bicycle traffic that
allow monitoring of behavioral change.

•

Prepare an expanded set of KYTC standard drawings and specifications related to bicycle
and pedestrian facilities.

•

Coordinate bicycle and pedestrian improvements with construction projects, such as roadway
maintenance, repaving, painting, sewer and water works, and utility corridors.

Mechanism 3: Establish education, encouragement, and enforcement programs that
support safe bicycle and pedestrian travel.
•

Design and implement a data-driven safety education campaign that targets drivers,
bicyclists, and pedestrians.

•

Develop a social marketing campaign to promote bicycling and walking.

•

Develop health improvement incentive programs related to biking and walking.

•

Review and update legislation regulating pedestrian and bicycle travel to incorporate recent
research findings and proven programs from other regions.

•

Train police officers to consistently enforce laws that promote safe bicycle and pedestrian
travel.

•

Expand auto trip reduction programs to encourage more people to travel by means other than
the private automobile (including bicycling and walking).

•

Encourage employer-based programs that offer incentives to bicycle and use transit with
disincentives to drive.

H-6

•

Develop a strong safety education program that includes videos for children and mandatory
street-crossing education and bicycle education programs as part of the physical education/
practical living curriculum.

•

Develop bicycle education programs targeting adult males, who suffer higher bicycle injury
and fatality rates than women or children. Discourage drinking and bicycling, recognizing
that alcohol is a factor in more than a third of bicycle fatalities.

•

Expand bicycle way-finding efforts statewide, to include maps, signage in the right of way,
and Web-based tools.

Quantification Methods
For the increase in walking and biking, the projected goal is identified in the POD and was used
to calculate the associated emission reductions:
•

Walking and bicycling account for 1% of person miles traveled by 2020, and 1.5% by 2030.

H-7

•

The participation in increased walking and biking was assumed to apply to all central
business districts (CBDs) in the state with employment and population rates greater than
20,000 people. These cities include:
o Louisville
o Lexington
o Bowling Green
o Owensboro
o Covington
o Richmond
o Hopkinsville
o Florence
o Henderson
o Frankfort
o Nicholasville
o Jeffersontown
o Paducah
o Elizabethtown
o Radcliff
o Independence
o Georgetown
o Ashland

Cities and rural areas with employment and populations below 20,000 were not considered in the
analysis. The analysts created a forecast to the year 2030 for employment using historic data
from 2005 to 2009 from the Workforce Kentucky Web site 5 for the following cities:
•

Louisville

•

Lexington

•

Bowling Green

•

Elizabethtown

•

Frankfort

The growth rates used for forecasting the employment to 2030 were taken from the Workforce
Kentucky Web site. The rest of the analysis was completed using the EPA COMMUTER Model,

H-8

as well as spreadsheet-based analysis. Individual runs using the employment baseline in 2005
and the employment forecast to 2030 for metropolitan areas, such as Louisville, Lexington,
Bowling Green, Elizabethtown and Frankfort, were completed using the EPA COMMUTER
Model. The EPA COMMUTER Model allows for local inputs, such as average time of driving to
work in a single-occupancy vehicle (SOV), and the user can specify local mode share inputs.
The EPA COMMUTER Model created a baseline daily VMT estimate. This baseline was
converted to daily PMT (person miles traveled) using the DOE person miles multiplier. 6 For the
scenario, the target total PMT decrease was assumed to be 0.78% by 2020 and 1.28% by 2030.
This scenario assumes that some activity in biking and walking is part of the baseline. In
addition, the scenario analysis was completed in a separate spreadsheet, since the COMMUTER
Model does not take into account that only trips below a certain travel distance threshold can be
considered for shifting away from using an SOV to bicycling and walking.
The daily PMT savings of increased participation in walking and biking were converted to reflect
yearly estimates assuming 240 work days per year. Emission factors and full fuel factors from
the most recent AEO were applied to the yearly VMT savings to create estimates for million
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) emissions saved as well as fuel savings.
These steps were completed for the five cities mentioned above.
Since workforce data were not readily available for the cities with populations between 20,000
and 40,000 employees, a factor for estimating the impacts was created using the Frankfort data
as a basis. A ratio of employment to population was created for Frankfort, and was applied to the
population data available for the remaining 13 small cities to estimate the total affected
employment in that area. The sum of the estimated number of employees for the small cities was
then used to estimate total emission savings by extrapolating from the Frankfort example.
The same process was repeated to estimate the impacts of increased carpool participation in the
city of Owensboro with a population between 50,000 and 60,000 using Bowling Green as the
example.
In addition to GHG emission savings, the analysts considered vehicle cost savings of 41 cents
(2005$) per mile from the AAA Web site. 7 Cost estimates include the following: Louisville, with
a population of 720,000, would spend $360,000 per year on Bicycle/pedestrian coordination;
Lexington, with a metropolitan population of 470,000, would spend $235,000 per year; and
Frankfort, with a population of 28,000, would spend $14,000 per year. A $20 million initial
construction cost and $1.5 million annual maintenance costs for the cities of Louisville,
Lexington, Elizabethtown, Bowling Green, and Owensboro were also implemented. This allows
for the construction of 25 miles of bicycle lanes per city. The region of the 14 smaller cities was
assumed to have an initial construction cost of $40 million and annual maintenance costs of $3
million. 8 Finally, the cost and GHG reduction estimates for the 14 small cities were added to the
individual estimates for Louisville, Lexington City, and Elizabethtown, as well as to the

TLU-2/6. Livability, Brownfield Redevelopment, Downtown Revitalization,
Location-Efficient Strategies, Land Use, Building Code Reform, and Connectivity

Policy Description
The Livability/Land Use bundle includes policies that will align growth and/or development in
Kentucky with the Commonwealth’s energy plan 11 and GHG reduction goals. Livability means
different things to different people. One common theme of livability is a high quality of life
encouraged by walkable, compact, and mixed-use development, which, among other things, has
the co-benefits of improving public health and reducing GHG emissions. An integral part
of livability is sustainability in using resources in a way that does not deplete nor permanently
damage them. Livability used here is a high quality of life lived in a sustainable manner.
These policies are intended to increase the number of walkable, bikable, compact, and mixed-use
communities in the Commonwealth, provide incentives for their development, and extend theses
concepts wherever feasible. In addition, these policies strive to encourage infill development,
increase density in support of transit services, and thus promote preservation of undeveloped
land outside urbanized areas. These policies are proven to reduce VMT and resulting GHGs.
Additional co-benefits of these development practices are less infrastructure to support a given
population/employment base, resulting in lower costs for water, sewer, and utility services and
reduced service distances as well as reduced maintenance costs; all sustainable development
practices.
In 2009, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA), and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) formed a partnership to
move our nation toward a livable and sustainable future. Through this partnership, six principles
were developed that describe livable, sustainable communities as places where transportation,
housing, and commercial development investments are coordinated to better serve the people
living in those communities:
1. Providing more transportation choices.
2. Expanding access to affordable housing.
3. Enhancing economic competitiveness-–giving people access to jobs, education, and services,
as well as giving businesses access to markets.
4. Targeting federal funds toward existing communities to spur revitalization and protect rural
landscapes.
5. Target federal funding toward existing communities—through strategies like transit oriented,
mixed-use development, and land recycling. Increasing collaboration among federal, state,
and local governments to better target investments and improve accountability.
6. Valuing the unique qualities of all communities, whether urban, suburban, or rural.

Gov/ Steven L. Beshear, Intelligent Energy for Kentucky’s Future: Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy
Independence, November 2008. Available at: http://www.energy.ky.gov/energyplan2008/.
H-12

Upon consideration of these principles, the desired outcome for our communities is a
“completeness” of economic, cultural, and environmental resources. Only then will our policies
result in a sustainable, positive impact on the issue of climate change. In an effort to achieve
“complete communities” for the citizens of the Commonwealth, the policies described in this
section will promote more location efficient growth and will align growth and/or development in
Kentucky with greenhouse gas reduction goals.
Implementation of such policies and strategies will enable more Kentuckians to conveniently
travel on foot, by bicycle, by transit, or with shorter driving trips; thereby, reducing VMT.
Improving the availability of planning tools and other resources will enable implementation. This
Livability/Land Use Planning bundle of policies includes the following elements:
•

Coordinated Transportation and land-use planning;

•

Livability Tools for Planning and Measuring Performance;

•

Bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure;

•

Transit-oriented development;

•

Revitalization in urban and rural communities, including infill, greyfield, and brownfield
redevelopment;

•

Educational resources and technical support for local and regional agencies;

•

Incentives and financial support to local and regional agencies; and

•

Evaluation of property tax assessment and zoning policies.

The combination of these policies and strategies will ensure maximum impact on attaining a
reduction of GHGs.
Policy Design

Goals: The Kentucky Chapter of the American Planning Association (KAPA) in consultation
with related industry, would explore how comprehensive planning documents (comprehensive
plans, metropolitan transportation plans (MTPs), Statewide Long Range Plans (SLRPs),
Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIPs), Metropolitan Transportation
Improvement Programs (MTIPs), and local land use plans can be coordinated to meet the
Commonwealth of Kentucky’s GHG reduction goals.
Timing:
•

By 2012, initiate partnership with the Kentucky American Planning Association (KAPA);

•

By 2012, disseminate to all local governments the EPA assessment tool, “Green Buildings
for Local Governments”, to assess current codes/ordinances and determine if barriers exist
for sustainable design and green buildings;

•

By 2015, all counties will have a comprehensive mapping of existing land uses that identifies
opportunities for development, redevelopment, and preservation;

H-13

•

By 2015, all incorporated cities with a population greater than 5,000 will adopt site planning
and urban design standards that help reduce VMT and GHG emissions;

•

By 2015 all counties will have a pedestrian/bicycle plan in place that will include “complete
street” policies;

•

By 2020, create a statewide incentive package that promotes compact urban and mixed use
development; and

•

By 2020, create a statewide incentive package that promotes brownfield, greyfield, and infill
development.

Implementation Mechanisms
The following implementation mechanisms all involve public outreach and input. All
implementation mechanisms will be coordinated through the proposed virtual State Planning
Resource Office.
Creation of a “Kentucky State Planning Resource Office”
Implementation of the following recommendations would be greatly facilitated by the creation of
a Kentucky State Planning Resource Office. The mission of this virtual office would be to
facilitate communication and collaboration among state agencies in the planning and delivery of
sustainable infrastructure investments across the Commonwealth of Kentucky. At a minimum,
this office would provide education, technical assistance, and links to funding resources for both
rural and urban communities. The three chief functions of the proposed Kentucky State Planning
Resource Office would be to:
•

Develop a compendium of best practices;

•

Help coordinate the policies and activities of state agencies;

•

Provide technical assistance and serve as an informational resource; and

•

Provide training and public awareness.

In 2008, considerable work was done creating specifications for a state planning office. The
results of this effort are available as attachments to this document.
Study of Best Practices (Part 1)
Identify potential best Sustainable Urban Development Practices (inventory) including ideal
development densities, GHG projection techniques, and energy efficiency. In addition,
transportation authorities should be given authority to prioritize projects that reduce VMT and
consider the GHG impact of constructing new roads. All practices should include specific
measurable results to permit evaluation of progress over time.
Ongoing Survey of Best Practices (Part 2)
Develop a continuous survey of Sustainable Urban Development Best Practices (SDBPs) in and
around Kentucky to assess their feasibility and profitability. The survey would serve as a
resource for the development community and related industries in identifying successful and
profitable SBDP programs (e.g., speakers bureau, Web site, public service announcements, etc.).
H-14

The close proximity of these case studies would permit interested Kentuckians to visit these
locations with minimal time and expense. This would be a continuous monitoring system of
SDBPs in Kentucky and surrounding states that would monitor performance and profitability,
emphasizing measurable and trackable results.
The survey would begin with a study setting up the system, collection of the initial data, and
design of updating procedures and public education program. The established system would be
assigned to an appropriate agency (State Planning Resource Office) to periodically update the
data; identify new, emerging SBDP programs; and to publicize findings. The underlying
assumption for continuous updating of the material is that the national economy is entering a
new paradigm challenged by future energy shortages and changing climate; and that this may
result in a long period of rapidly changing/ evolving SDBP programs that Kentucky could learn
from and prosper by with implementation
Coordination of Land Use and Transportation Planning
Effective coordination of state, regional, local land use and transportation plans will be necessary
to develop realistic GHG reduction targets. At the same time, individual communities need the
flexibility to choose the specific policies that help them meet those targets. Many communities
have used scenario planning as an effective way to quantify land use and transportation planning
decisions in their efforts to reduce VMT and GHGs.
Scenario planning matches alternative future land use plans with alternative future transportation
plans. These plans are evaluated and/or run through a simulation model (e.g., TransCad, ICLEI,
Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator [MOVES], etc.) to project impacts on VMT, land
consumption rates, air pollution, GHGs, infrastructure costs, and other outcomes. When technical
modeling is not feasible, qualitative assessments can be performed. GHG projections from
alternative land use and transportation proposals should be incorporated into state and local
plans.
In October 2010, the FHWA released a scenario planning guidebook to assist government
agencies in implementing the scenario planning process from start to finish.
Livability Tools for Planning and Measuring Performance
The KYTC and the FHWA–Kentucky Division will develop a “livability matrix” to assist
communities to determine their current livability status and the status of proposed development.
Bicycle and Pedestrian Infrastructure
Complete Streets are streets that provide transportation facilities for all users, including
pedestrians, bicyclists, transit users and motorists, to the extent appropriate for the land use or the
context of the street. The Commonwealth of Kentucky should develop a statewide policy that
requires “complete street” design be considered for all state and federal projects. (This is similar
to the existing “bike/ped” policy that the KYTC currently has in existence.”)
An extra component should be added to the KYTC’s Project Identification Form (PIF) that
indicates whether a project is a complete street. Projects that are “complete streets” should rise

H-15

higher in the ranking process for the STIP and receive priority funding. Metropolitan planning
organizations (MPOs) should also follow suit when ranking projects for their MTPs and TIPs.
This requirement would apply to all roads that will receive state or federal funding. It would
require support from the FHWA, the KYTC, and local governments. For neighborhood
developments it would involve planners, builders, electricians, architects, developers, utilities,
and retailers of energy-efficient products. All efforts would involve the general public. In
addition to supporting a statewide complete streets policy, KYTC should:
•

Work to implement KYTC’s access management guidelines where feasible by developing
Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) with local communities;

•

Develop “road diet” guidelines and will work with local communities to implement
guidelines where feasible; and

•

Continue to support the maintenance and development of the rural and urban transit systems.

Transit-Oriented Development
A transit-oriented development (TOD) is mix of land uses—residential, office, shopping, civic
uses, and entertainment—within easy walking distance of a transit station. TODs can reduce
VMTs and GHGs emissions by promoting the use of multimodal and mass transit. This
development concept is similar to development that occurred throughout the United States prior
to the 1950s and can be seen in many of Kentucky’s historic districts near rail lines. State,
regional, and local governments should plan transit-ready corridors and provide incentives for
TODs. Transit-ready corridors would improve the feasibility of future transit service throughout
the state.
Revitalization, Including Infill, Greyfield, and Brownfield Redevelopment
The Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development (KCED) and the Kentucky Department for
Environmental Protection will work together to facilitate the cleanup and redevelopment of
brownfields and greyfields. In particular, they will work with company representatives and local
officials when facilities are initially closing, which in turn will expedite the cleanup and
redevelopment of the facility. Earlier coordination enables the placement of the property on the
market before the facility deteriorates due to lack of maintenance or vandalism.
State government will lead by example in promoting infill and redevelopment of brownfields and
greyfields. The High-Performance Building Committee, established in House Bill 2 (2008
regular session), should consider the effect on VMT and community sustainability as it assists
the Finance and Administration Cabinet (FAC) in the review of state building projects. These
issues should be included in professional development programs for state and local building
designers, construction companies, school districts, building managers, and the general public.
KCED should create a statewide package of sustainable growth incentives and promote them in
coordination with local governments. Such incentives should include, but not be limited to,
contracting based on measurable GHG reduction and utilizing such devices as fast-tracking
permits, tax reductions, “green” certification designations, awards programs, etc.
School Siting Considerations
H-16

The location of a school has a major impact on a community’s land use and development
patterns. The state should encourage the Kentucky Board of Education to support the concept of
sustainability for school facility planning, including the renovation and reuse of existing school
buildings. To accomplish this, the board could:
•

Eliminate minimum acreage standards in order to preserve community-centered schools.

•

Eliminate the guideline that suggests a new school should be built if the renovation costs
exceed 80% of building a new school.

•

Ensure a complete analysis is conducted, taking into consideration all consequences, before a
decision is made concerning school consolidation. The analysis should consider the number
of students for whom school location makes walking or biking to school feasible.

•

Adopt revised policies and regulations that encourage restoration and rehabilitation of
community schools over new construction of school buildings.

•

Encourage renovation projects with a sustained, substantial, and dedicated funding
commitment through an “Aging Schools Construction Fund.”

•

Amend state law to allow local governments and school boards to sell surplus property for a
nominal fee if the property is to be used for public purposes.

•

Expand local school planning committees to include a representative from the local
government office that is responsible for planning and development.

•

Explore the possibility of obtaining supplemental funding for historic schools to assist with
adaptive reuse projects, such as senior housing and community centers. Funding from the
Main Street and Renaissance Kentucky programs could be used in those locations.

Educational and Technical Support for Local and Regional Agencies
Develop a related public sector educational program for local mayors, county judge executives,
and city planners. Work with KAPA, MPOs, and area development districts (ADDs) to provide
training on scenario planning, complete streets programs, livability assessments, and the EPA
assessment tool for analyzing current codes and ordinances.
State agencies will collaborate on providing educational and technical assistance to Kentucky
communities about the “complete communities” strategies. Sample policies and strategies and
best practices will be provided for local consideration through the Kentucky State Planning
Resource Office. Not every community will be expected to use the exact same tools or strategies.
Communities will be given flexibility and choices to achieve VMT reduction goals through their
ideal growth and development. Local governments and other stakeholders, such as developers
and private lending institutions, will be provided technical assistance that will include diverse
strategies for communities to consider using in reaching their VMT reduction goals.
Educational and technical assistance will include:
•

The capabilities for communities to examine their current level of livability and
sustainability, and to plan toward increasing that current level.

H-17

•

The capabilities for local governments to adopt comprehensive plans, zoning regulations,
and urban design standards that help reduce VMT and GHG emissions, such as:
o Implementing design standards that increase street network density and connectivity in
new development and redevelopment projects (i.e., reduce cul-de-sacs and increase street
network densities);
o Implementing community development that is compact and mixed-use, and includes
adaptive re-use of existing resources;
o Developing a pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly environment by creating design guidelines
that require connectivity and accessibility within the community, especially to “basic
needs” services (food, clothing, healthcare, education, etc.);
o Implementing TOF that includes “basic need” services; and
o Providing incentives for greater sidewalk coverage in all future residential, commercial,
and retail developments (meaning that all streets within such developments should have
sidewalks);
o Providing incentives to design or locate residential projects to encourage a greater
proportion of dwelling units to be developed within a one-half mile walking distance of at
least two or more commercial, retail, or entertainment centers; and
o Providing incentives for the preservation of rural landscapes.

Education will be provided to the general public and state legislators, as well as to local officials
and developers, as appropriate. Education and technical assistance will be developed with the
advice of federal, state, and local governments, academics, and other stakeholders and will focus
on bridging the gap between transportation planners and land-use planners. State agencies will
share responsibility in implementing cooperative strategies, where deemed appropriate.
Incentives and Financial Support to Local and Regional Agencies
Existing incentives, funding, and loan programs administered by the state that are applicable to
growth and development should be assessed and realigned to support the elements of this
Livability/Land-Use Planning bundle of policies. Rating systems and prioritization of funding
will be reviewed and improved to meet livability/sustainability objectives. New programs will be
developed, and existing programs will be revised to fill in gaps where no program exists to meet
needs that cannot be achieved, or are far less likely to be achieved, without funding assistance
(e.g., improved brownfields and greyfields incentives, increased technical assistance funding).
Evaluation of Property Tax Assessment and Zoning Policies
Local governments should utilize the EPA toolkit for sustainable design, “Green Building for
Local Governments.” This toolkit is designed to help local governments identify and remove
barriers to sustainable design and green building within their permitting process. It addresses the
local codes and ordinances that would affect the design, construction, renovation, and operation
and maintenance of a building and its immediate site. For example, it is common for zoning
ordinances to have minimum parking requirements, minimum setbacks, land use segregation,
and maximum densities. In many cases, these ordinances prevent sustainable development and
should be revised to allow flexibility.
H-18

In addition to revising local ordinances to provide flexibility, local governments should work
with state and federal agencies to create incentive packages for transit oriented, infill,
brownfield, greyfield, and rehab developments. Local governments need to be aware of existing
tax incentives and new ones as they become available. The Kentucky State Planning Resource
Office would be able to provide this information and examples of their implementation. At the
local level, tax incentive packages should be targeted to areas identified for sustainable
development. This would provide developers with multiple sources of financing for projects in
those locations. Examples of tax incentive tools for funding include but are not limited to:
•

Brownfield redevelopment tax credits,

•

Energy-efficient construction tax credits,

•

Low-income housing tax credits;

•

New markets tax credits,

•

Historic preservation tax credits,

•

Rehabilitation tax credits, and

•

Tax Increment Financing Districts.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
No major policies or programs are in place. Some programs that relate somewhat to livability
include:
•

KYTC Bike/Ped Policy,

•

Safe Routes to School program, and

•

“Healthy Communities” initiative partnership between KYTC and the Kentucky Cabinet for
Health and Family Services (CHFS),

Louisville Metro has several programs and initiatives in place that are consistent with these
policies, including:
•

Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan,

•

Complete Street Policy,

•

Healthy Hometown Movement,

•

Partnership for a Green City, and

•

Step Up Louisville.

Key Uncertainties
There is a strong feeling that it is not the state’s responsibility to dictate land use to local
communities. And, there is concern that any effort to “educate” not be interpreted as “dictating.”
As stated, a Kentucky State Planning Resource Office—virtual or otherwise—was seen by the
Livability/Land Use team as critical for the implementation of most of these recommendations.
•

Will there be inter-cabinet support for the concept of a Kentucky State Planning Resource
Office?

•

If so, who will take the lead to implement a Kentucky State Planning Resource Office?

•

Will necessary resources, including staff time, be made available?

In addition, these policies are not recommending the restriction of any form of development.
Rather, they are promoting development that will create more transportation choices for
Kentucky residents.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Statewide policies to foster complete communities will have significant economic, social, and
ecological benefits for communities across Kentucky. Implementation of such policies and
strategies will enable more Kentuckians to conveniently travel on foot, by bicycle, by transit, or
with shorter driving trips. Proven co-benefits to these policies include:
•

Reduced cost for building and maintaining infrastructure,

•

More transportation choices for residents, and

•

More opportunities for residents to have physically active lifestyles.

TLU-3A. Transportation System Management

Policy Description
This policy is designed to align Kentucky’s transportation system with the Commonwealth’s
energy plan 12 and GHG reduction goals. Transportation system management (TSM) is the
concept of pairing transportation demand with transportation supply to help transportation
networks serve the demand effectively and efficiently. TSM strategies are relatively low in cost
but effective in nature. Each strategy alone provides a relatively small benefit to energy demands
and GHG reduction, but when applied in concert, substantial gains can be achieved.
TSM strategies attempt to reduce the number of trips taken by SOVs, shorten trip lengths, reduce
delay, increase the reliability of the network, and reduce idling (and/or other transportation
actions that increase GHG emissions). The goal of TSM is to reduce the daily VMT per capita on
the transportation network. An added benefit of effective TSM is reduced vehicle hours traveled
(VHT) per capita, which measures the amount of traffic congestion delay. Reduced VMT or
VHT is highly correlated with reduced GHG emissions.
TSM attempts to both improve transportation system performance and alter travel behavior
through a combination of technological improvements, incentives, design, and restrictions.
Technological improvements include traffic signal coordination, traveler information displays,
lane management, real-time monitoring of traffic conditions to adapt/improve operations, and
other intelligent transportation system (ITS) applications. Incentives can include policies that
financially favor desired behavior or allow users to gain a time advantage and include value
pricing and smart parking strategies. System design is also important, since infrastructure and
technology can be adapted to encourage less driving, and it includes access management;
intersection improvements; bottleneck removal; and integrated, interconnected, intermodal
systems to serve the mobility needs of people and goods and foster economic growth. Finally,
users can be barred from performing certain actions that would negatively impact the efficiency
of the transportation system.
TSM policies can be instituted at every level of government. Some can have a virtually instant
effect, while others require many decades to realize full benefits.
Policy Design
Goals: The overarching goal is to reduce urban per-capita VMT in the range of 10%–15% by
2030.
•

Develop and implement policies and strategies that include program funding, financial and
development incentives, infrastructure investment, and regulatory requirements to promote
transportation system management improvements that result in reduced VMT and/or VHT
which, in turn, result in reduced GHG emissions. These actions, taken in concert with other
aggressive TLU policy actions, should be designed to reduce urban per-capita VMT in the

range of 10%–15% by 2030; VHT can be reduced by amounts that are associated with these
VMT reductions. VHT reduction is recognized as a means of reducing driver delay, while
also reducing excess fuel consumption in congested traffic.
•

Reduce existing and future trips and trip lengths in an effort to reduce both VMT and VHT.
Driving less, in terms of both hours and miles driven, will decrease GHG emissions. This can
be achieved through the aggressive implementation of specific transportation demand
management (TDM) strategies and coordinated TLU planning and decision making.

•

Distribute existing and future trips in terms of both time and geography—when trips are
taken and where trips are taken—to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flow. Reducing
congestion and smoothing flow by changing people’s driving patterns—by changing either
the time of day they drive or the route they take—will result in less idling and stop-and-go
driving. This will reduce VHT and GHG emissions and can be achieved through increased
investment in supporting transportation infrastructure, implementation of specific TSM
strategies, and the aggressive implementation of specific TDM strategies.

•

Improve transportation system operations to improve travel conditions on the transportation
network. This includes traffic signal coordination and remote communication, real-time
traveler information and traffic monitoring and analysis, advanced computerized lane and
parking space management, value pricing at future toll locations, intersection improvements
such as roundabouts, diverging diamond, 13 grade separations, advanced incident
management, and other traffic operation applications. This will reduce the frequency of
transportation actions that contribute to high levels of GHG emissions (for example, quick
starts, idling, and excessive braking). It will require an increased investment in TSM-related
capacity/infrastructure and aggressive implementation of non-capacity operational strategies
that improve the flow of vehicles (including smart/efficient integrated transit, Bicycle, and
pedestrian facilities) on the transportation network.

Timing: 2010–2030—Various TSM strategies have a variety of implementation time frames.
Some, such as workplace-based strategies, can begin implementation almost immediately. Others
that are based on infrastructure construction will have an implementation timeline of 4–10 years.
Systemic changes to the urban landscape have the longest horizon—up to 25 years.
Parties Involved: Federal transportation agencies (FHWA, Federal Transit Administration);
state government agencies (many departments of KYTC and District Highway Offices, economic
development agencies); state and local community affairs agencies; selected Kentucky
environmental protection agencies; regional government agencies (metropolitan planning
organizations [MPOs], area development districts [ADDs)] regional planning councils); regional
transportation authorities; local transportation providers (public transit agencies, airports, river
ports, expressway/bridge authorities; local governments and agencies.
Other: None identified.

A diverging diamond interchange is a rare form of diamond interchange in which the two directions of traffic on
the non-freeway road cross to the opposite side on both sides of the bridge at the freeway. It is unusual in that it
requires drivers on the freeway overpass (or underpass) to briefly drive on the side of the road opposite than what
they are accustomed to.

Implementation Mechanisms
Collectively, the implementation mechanisms recommended under this policy attempt to reduce
GHG emissions by enhancing system efficiency and modifying travel behavior and conditions
through TSM strategies. Those strategies will require a combination of program funding,
financial and development incentives, infrastructure and technology investment, and regulatory
requirements implemented at local, state, and regional levels.
Reduce existing and future trips and trip lengths.
These implementation mechanisms are intended to result in either the reduction of trip lengths or
the complete elimination of certain trips. This can reduce both VMT and VHT, which in turn will
reduce GHG emissions. Implementation mechanisms intended to reduce trips and trip lengths
include:
•

Encourage and/or incentivize public- and private-sector employers to implement telework
programs for eligible employees. This can result in fewer work-based vehicle trips.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public- and private-sector employers to implement job-sharing
programs for eligible employees. This can result in fewer work-based vehicle trips.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public- and private-sector employers to fund and implement
regional and local carpooling and vanpooling programs. This can result in fewer work-based
vehicle trips.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize enhanced coordination between land use and transportation
planning and decision making to reduce distances between clusters of affordable housing,
employment opportunities, and people supplies/services.

Distribute existing and future trips in terms of both time (when a trip is taken) and
geography (where a trip is taken).

H-24

These implementation mechanisms are intended to change people’s driving patterns and
behaviors (by changing either the time of day they drive or the route they take), resulting in
reduced congestion and smoother traffic flows. Reducing congestion will result in less idling and
stop-and-go driving which, in turn, can result in fewer GHG emissions. Implementation
mechanisms intended to change people’s driving patterns and behaviors include:
•

Encourage and incentivize transportation facility operators to implement value-pricing
(variable-pricing) policies. This can encourage travelers to change the time of day they make
various types of trips and result in fewer vehicle trips during peak periods. Alternatively, this
will encourage travelers to change the routes they take for various types of trips and will
result in a more even distribution of vehicle trips across the transportation network.

•

Encourage and incentivize public and private parking facility operators to implement smart
parking policies. This can encourage travelers to change the time of day they make various
types of trips and will result in fewer vehicle trips during peak hours.

•

Encourage and incentivize local governments and private developers to build up the
supporting transportation network (e.g., lower functional class street network), improve local
transit routes that support express bus routes and premium transit options, and construct more
sidewalks and Bicycle pathways. This can encourage/enable travelers to make appropriate
route and mode choices and result in a more even distribution of vehicle trips across the
transportation network.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public- and private-sector employees to implement flex-time
and compressed time programs for eligible employees. This can result in fewer work-based
vehicle trips during peak periods and, in cases of compressed time programs, fewer workbased trips overall.

Improve transportation system operations to reduce occurrences of transportation actions
that contribute to high levels of GHGs (e.g., “jack rabbit” starts, idling, and excessive
braking).
These implementation mechanisms are intended to maximize the efficiency of the transportation
system through the application of technology and advanced design. Management of the supply of
transportation capacity through the application of various technologies and design strategies will
result in reduced congestion and smoother traffic flows, which, in turn, can result in less idling
and stop-and-go driving and reduced GHG emissions. Implementation mechanisms intended to
change people’s driving patterns and behaviors and reduce VMT and VHT include:
•

Increase investment in ITS technologies at all levels (including ITS systems already in
operation/installed), particularly those that can help smooth traffic flow.

•

Increase investment in traffic monitoring and analysis systems to support TSM, ITS, incident
management, congestion management, systems maintenance, sustainability, etc.

•

Increase investment in incident management programs and technologies (e.g., roadside
assistance) that can smooth traffic flow and reduce delay.

•

Increase investment in traffic signal systems to smooth traffic flow and reduce delay through
traffic signal timing, such as coordination, prioritization, and installing/upgrading/
maintaining remote communications.

H-25

•

Encourage and/or incentivize access management programs at all levels, particularly those
that coordinate land use and transportation decision making. This can reduce conflicts among
other positive impacts.

•

Increase investment in traveler information technologies that can maximize efficient use of
the network.

•

Increase investment in managed-lane technology to maximize available capacity and smooth
traffic flow.

Other TSM implementation mechanisms (not specifically mentioned above) that have proven to
reduce VMT, VHT, and GHGs and fall into the strategies mentioned above include:
•

Special-events management strategies.

•

Installation, upgrades, and maintenance of traffic signal hardware, such as controllers,
cabinets, and vehicle and pedestrian detection hardware.

•

Turning lanes.

•

Acceleration, deceleration, and weaving sections (e.g., lanes and ramps).

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Quantification Methods
This analysis examines potential GHG reductions from TSM strategies. Within this broad
category are three strategies:
•

Reduce Existing and Future Trip Lengths

•

Distribute Existing and Future Trips Across Time and Geography

•

Improve Transportation System Operations

The goal for the TSM strategy is to reduce LDV GHG emissions by 3.05%. The target is based
on DOT’s estimate of the GHG reduction potential of strategies to improve transportation
systems. 14 DOT estimates strategies to improve transportation system efficiency may reduce
GHG emissions by 3%–6% compared to the BAU scenario. However, 1.1%–1.8% of the 3%–6%
emission reduction is attributed to reduced speed limits. Since states may not be able to influence
speed limits as easily as other aspects of transportation system efficiency, for the purposes of this
analysis speed limit reduction was not included in the analysis. After factoring out speed limit
reduction strategies, the estimated midpoint of the range of potential GHG emission reduction
achievable from TSM is 3.05%.
Each of the three strategies will contribute to the total emissions reduction goal. Reducing
existing and future trip lengths, distributing existing and future trips, and improving
transportation system operations were assumed to each reduce GHG emissions by 1.016%.
Combined, these three strategies would reduce per GHG emissions by about 3.05%.
Each strategy was assumed to take 10 years to fully implement and had a 10-year linear ramp up.
After the ramp-up period, the strategy was assumed to be fully implemented and held constant
for the remainder of the period of analysis. The 10-year implementation estimate is consistent
with DOT estimates. DOT estimates transportation system strategies may take 5–10 years to
fully deploy. 15 This analysis assumes the more conservative 10-year strategy implementation
period.
The reduction in GHG emissions was calibrated with the Kentucky Inventory’s total VMT
estimates. The difference between the baseline total VMT and the scenario with the GHG
emission reduction strategies is used to estimate fuel and vehicle operation cost savings. The
VMT reduction estimate is also used to estimate gallons of fuel saved and vehicle ownership and
operation cost savings. The projected fuel cost estimates are from the most recent AEO projected
cost estimates. The vehicle ownership and operation costs are estimated using AAA estimates of
the cost to own and operate a vehicle per mile. The capital costs of the TSM strategy were
estimated to be about $13 million per year based on Kentucky’s average annual expenditure on
ITS between 2001 and 2007. 16

The statewide average annual expenditure on ITS was checked against city-level expenditure
estimates to ensure the reasonableness of the statewide estimate. The statewide average annual
expenditure on ITS is about 3.5 times larger than TRIMARC’s average annual expenditure on
ITS. Kentucky’s average annual expenditure on ITS was about $13 million per year between
2001 and 2007, whereas TRIMARC’s average annual expenditure on ITS was about $3.7 million
per year between 1997 and 2007. 17 These state and local estimates from two different studies
corroborate one another.

fluctuations affect VMT significantly.

Another uncertainty is the degree to which people will respond to incentives and
disincentives to reduce existing and future trip lengths, distribute existing and future trips
across time and geography, and improve transportation system operations. This sort of effort
requires buy-in and some coordination between employers, employees, homebuyers, car and

TLU-3B/4. Transit Management and Infrastructure

Policy Description
This policy presents objectives and strategies intended to make public transit a legitimate
transportation choice for the citizens of Kentucky, which will reduce energy demand and the
GHG emissions associated with transportation. DOT recently announced that the national
average CO2 emissions per passenger-mile for bus transit is just two-thirds that of the average
private automobile. When buses operate with all seats occupied, that fraction is reduced to less
than one-fifth. The following additional data support this policy recommendation:
•

EIA forecasts that oil prices could rise to $210 per barrel from their current level
(approximately $75/barrel) by 2035. 19 The rising cost of fuel will cause more Kentuckians to
rely on public transit for travel needs.

•

Public transit is the safest form of transportation in America today. In 2007, 864 people were
killed on Kentucky roads, and 38,786 people were injured. 20

•

Kentucky has one of the lowest per-capita funding rates for public transportation in the
country. Currently, that rate is less than $ 0.30 per person annually.

•

During 2008, Kentucky’s three urban transit agencies (Lextrans, Transit Authority of River
City, and Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky) provided 25,487,600 trips to passengers.

•

Greater use of public transit and reduction in automobile travel can be achieved by expanding
public transit infrastructure, both within and among Kentucky’s communities. Infrastructure
improvements, such as conversion of mixed-traffic lanes to dedicated bus or light-rail lanes,
can significantly aid level-of-service measures.

Public transportation improvements are critical to support livability initiatives (as referenced in
TLU-2/6), and are essential to an ongoing effort to reduce VMT. As an example, a 2008
Transportation Research Board study found that households in 17 TODs the country took 44%
fewer car trips than the Institute of Transportation Engineers’ manual suggests for a typical
housing development
This policy includes four recommended components of change that are needed on the state level
to expand and improve transit infrastructure:
•

Funding—Increase funding for transit at the state level. Current levels and allocation
formulas of state funding for transit are inadequate to maintain—let alone substantially
expand and improve—transit infrastructure to reduce VMT.

•

Studies and Planning—Provide local governments and MPOs the leadership and assistance
needed to initiate transportation corridor studies. Partner with local governments and MPOs
to study how we might provide more transit opportunities within and between rural areas of
the state, as well as between our urban centers.

H-30

•

Technical Assistance—Provide technical assistance, where needed, to promote the
coordination of land use and transportation infrastructure planning, with the goal of
increasing transportation options and decreasing transportation costs.

•

Transit Marketing and Promotion—Provide incentives and marketing strategies aimed at
increasing awareness regarding the benefits of mass transit in a community.

The goals and strategies outlined in this policy recommendation will support transit as a viable
transportation choice for the citizens of Kentucky, and will help the state realize the potential for
GHG emission reductions associated with transportation. At the same time, the policy will
encourage growth and development that make the most effective and efficient use of the state’s
resources by supporting cost-effective transportation mode choices. The policy will:
•

Support desired shifts in passenger transportation mode choice to lower-carbon options.

•

Encourage growth and development in Kentucky that make effective and efficient use of
expenditures on transportation infrastructure by supporting cost-effective mode choices.

•

Partner with existing transit agencies to improve the level of service (travel time, reliability,
and convenience) through support of transit operating and capital programs.

•

Encourage and facilitate “buy-in” among affected agencies and stakeholders.

Policy Design
An important strategy in reducing GHG emissions produced from transportation sources is
reducing the growth rate in per-capita VMT. Providing alternatives to the SOV has been shown
to reduce the number of trips and VMT on the highway system. Modal alternatives can include
bus transit and paratransit, rail transit, ridesharing, and vanpools (in addition to bicycling and
walking, which are not addressed here).
Increased transit use is key to reducing the growth rate of VMT. A higher rate of transit use can
be achieved by improving transit’s competitiveness with other modes, expanding transit services,
ensuring the safety and security of transit systems, and educating the public about transit options
available in their community. Transit’s competitiveness will be enhanced by providing the
livable, walkable, complete streets context in which transit can be cost-effective. (See TLU-2/6.)
Goals: Increase transit ridership statewide by 100% from 2010 levels by 2020, and an additional
150% by 2030. (Ridership will be measured on a per-capita basis, in order to prevent population
demographics from affecting the goal.)
Timing: See the Goals section, above.
Parties Involved: The Kentucky Public Transportation Association (KPTA), public transit
agencies, MPOs, local governments, and KYTC all have a place in implementing this policy.
Communities that currently have public transit will be positively affected by the policy.
Other: None identified.

H-31

Implementation Mechanisms
•

Enact complete streets legislation. In the context of the Kentucky’s Complete Streets
Ordinance, encourage local governments and developers to provide and expand bicycle and
pedestrian facilities. Complete streets provide the context for transit to be successful.
Improved pedestrian access to Kentucky’s transportation infrastructure promotes transit use,
since all transit trips begin and end as pedestrian trips.

•

Establish a dedicated source of funding to fully match federal transit funds allocated to
Kentucky, and to support transit capital investments in Kentucky’s communities.

•

Increase capital investment in transit infrastructure to ensure reliability (vehicle location and
next-bus systems increase on-time performance and, therefore, reliability); improve safety
(lighting and surveillance at stops and stations, improved signage); and increase the
competitiveness of transit (e.g., bus-only lanes and signal prioritization).

•

Increase investment in public transit systems to provide more frequent service and longer
service hours, which will make transit more competitive with SOV travel. More frequent
service is more convenient service.

•

Support the creation of new public transportation systems and options, including bus rapid
transit and commuter rail.

•

Provide preferential and discounted parking to vanpool vehicles at all state-owned parking
facilities.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
KPTA addresses issues with public transportation and seeks to attain funding from the Kentucky
General Assembly to match all federal funds for transit programs.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Predominantly CO2 emissions.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
The estimated GHG reductions, energy savings, net present value, and cost-effectiveness of
TLU-3B/4 are summarized in Table TLU-3B/4-1. Transit management and infrastructure
strategies have a net positive cost. Transit systems often have significant capital costs, but the
share of system expansion costs allocated to transit-displaced GHG emissions activities are
mostly offset by fuel cost savings and vehicle ownership and operation cost savings from mode
shift, congestion relief, and land use leverage.

Quantification Methods
This analysis examines potential GHG reductions for a transit management and infrastructure
strategy. Based on the POD goal language from above, the goal for the strategy is to increase
transit ridership in the state by 100% from 2010 levels by 2020, and an additional 150% by 2030.
The scenario was modeled by increasing transit passenger revenue miles by 100% between 2011
and 2020 and 150% between 2011 and 2030.
Using the strategy goal, the associated GHG emission reductions were estimated using analytical
methods developed by the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). 21 According to
APTA, transit service provision reduces total VMT and GHG emissions in three ways: mode
shift, congestion relief, and land use leverage. Mode shift occurs when transit service reduces
total VMT as some people switch from private vehicle trips to transit trips and fewer vehicles are
used to transport people. Congestion relief occurs when the reduction in total VMT from mode
shift decreases congestion, which improves overall transportation system flow and fuel economy.
Land use leverage occurs because transit service often facilitates denser land use and planning
options. Communities with compact development patterns tend to have lower demand for
private vehicle trips relative to communities with less compact development.
The analysis was performed using Jack Faucett Associates’ TARGGET (Transit Associated
Reduced Greenhouse Gas Emissions Tool) program. TARGGET develops historic, current, and
projected displaced GHG emissions from transit, as well as fuel savings and vehicle ownership
and operation savings on an annual basis. TARGGET fully adheres to APTA’s guidance on
measuring transit-displaced GHG emissions. However, instead of using APTA’s default land use
leverage factor of 1.9, TARGGET calculates a unique land use leverage factor based on transit
agency passenger revenue miles and service area population and density. This allows the analysis
to develop Kentucky-specific estimates.
Current transit passenger revenue mile estimates were taken from the National Transit Database,
which is maintained by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA). 22 Using APTA’s guidance,
the quantity of statewide VMT that transit systems displace can be estimated. Displaced VMT is
then used to estimate fuel and vehicle operation cost savings. The VMT reduction estimate is
also used to estimate gallons of fuel saved and the associated reduction in GHG emissions. The

capital costs of the transit management and infrastructure were estimated using GHG emission
reduction strategy cost estimates in the Moving Cooler report and a joint product cost allocation
estimate. 23
Joint product cost allocation is a process by which a share of a program's overall cost is applied
to one specific benefit, rather than the entire cost. Transit produces many benefits in addition to
GHG reduction. These include improved transportation services, easier access to a variety of
work, leisure, family, and commercial destinations. GHG reduction is one of several benefits
purchased with the expenditure on increased transit, and it was allocated to only part of the
capital cost estimate. For the purpose of this analysis, a joint product cost allocation of 20% was
applied to the capital cost estimates from the Moving Cooler report.
Mode shift was estimated by taking current and projected transit passenger revenue miles and
multiplying them by APTA’s mode shift factor based on transit service region population.
Congestion relief was estimated by taking current and projected transit passenger revenue miles
and multiplying them by APTA’s congestion relief factor, which is derived from the Texas
Transportation Institute’s 2009 Annual Urban Mobility Report. 24 The Urban Mobility Report
provides congestion profiles and factors for cities based on size. Land use leverage was
estimated using the TARGGET tool, instead of APTA’s national default land use leverage factor.
TARGGET uses transit service area population, density, and passenger revenue miles to develop
unique, Kentucky-specific land use leverage factors for each year and for each local transit
agency to account for changes in population, density, and passenger revenue miles.

Key Assumptions
An important assumption is that transit passenger revenue miles will increase by 100% between
2011 and 2020 and 150% between 2011 and 2030. This is the goal of the strategy and the
primary assumption the reduction scenario is modeled upon.

Key Uncertainties
•

Funding availability for the provision of additional transit service.

•

A key uncertainty is future fuel prices. Fuel prices may fluctuate unpredictably, and their
fluctuations affect VMT significantly.

•

Another uncertainty is the degree to which land use leverage will occur. Aside from transit
service provision, land use planning and zoning influence how much density and decreased
demand for private vehicle trips is achieved in a region when transit service is provided. For
example, mixed-use zoning may facilitate less demand for vehicle trips by locating
residential units, grocery stores, community centers, retail and services, and businesses
within walking distance of one another. Therefore, land use planning and transit service

H-35

provision influence one another when strategies are implemented to reduce private vehicle
trip demand.
Additional Benefits and Costs
The provision of transit service results in other more direct benefits and cost impacts. Most
important are travel time benefits that accrue to transit users, reduced air pollution, and
congestion relief that affects road users on parallel routes.

TLU-5. Education and Outreach for Vehicle Maintenance, Idle Reduction,
and Co-Driving, and Promote Alternative Modes of Travel

Policy Description
This policy is designed to inform Kentucky’s citizens of how they can save energy, reduce costs
and protect the environment through their daily activities can influence the ability of the
Commonwealth to meet its objectives of reducing energy demand and GHG emissions. Slight
modifications in behavior and habit can result in significant energy demand and GHG reductions.
Therefore, to achieve the objective of a more informed citizenry, a comprehensive and
coordinated education outreach program is required. While education and outreach efforts need
to address numerous topics, these key areas have been identified as critical for raising awareness
on this issue:
•

Energy demand and GHG emissions are reduced by improving fuel efficiency, using such
measures as:
o Improved driving habits, including moderating acceleration, shifting at lower revolutions
per minute, using cruise control, and reducing idling.
o Maintaining proper tire pressure and appropriate levels of engine lubricants.
o Encouraging use of replacement vehicles that have higher fuel efficiency.

•

Alternative transportation modes that do not contribute to energy demands and GHG
emissions are promoted by:
o Campaigns to promote use of transit riding, walking, and cycling, rather than vehicle use.
o Educating drivers to “share the road” and cyclists to obey traffic laws.

Educational opportunities can come in many forms. Opportunities to cooperate and partner with
existing promotional campaigns and public outreach should be sought. Development and
implementation of a focused multimedia campaign will be a cornerstone of the educational
program. Incorporating a GHG message into existing educational venues, such as the Kentucky
Driver Manual and licensing exam for new drivers and the driver education classes provided by
many Kentucky high schools should be considered. Mandating that driver education be offered
as part of all Kentucky high school curricula may also be considered. Establishing a “Drive
Smart–Drive Green” or other similarly monikered license plate may raise not only awareness but
also funding for other education initiatives. Efforts to reach existing drivers can be made by
distributing information when motor vehicle licenses or vehicle registrations are renewed.
Partnerships with the insurance industry could result in reduced insurance rates for drivers who
have completed “green drivers training” and pledged to follow the guidelines.
Promotion of the Smart Cycling program, a set of curricula for adults and children and the
certified instructors who teach it, will be important for expanding the use of alternative modes of
travel. Smart Cycling classes are taught across the United States by League Cycling Instructors
(LCIs), certified by the League of American Bicyclists, to provide the tools, tips, and techniques
to safely ride a Bicycle, to be confident enough to share the road with vehicles, and to teach
H-37

children to ride cautiously and conspicuously on their own. Simply knowing how to ride a
Bicycle is not the same as knowing how to operate a Bicycle safely and legally. This training, in
addition to Share the Road training for drivers, will be important as initiatives begin to show
results and the number of cyclists on the road increases.
Policy Design
This CAP policy is intended to increase awareness of the general public of personal
transportation-related behaviors, within their control, that may positively or negatively impact
energy use and GHG emissions. An effective multimedia campaign can be developed that
promotes improved driving habits and behavior, encourages use of alternative or more efficient
means of transportation, emphasizes the benefits of proper vehicle maintenance, and explains the
interconnection between land use decisions and the consumption of resources. Developing
educational opportunities for both the driving and the cycling public will promote harmonious
use of existing facilities and reduction in conflict between vehicles and people traveling along
the roadside.
Measures developed will have the intent of promoting positive change through education
statewide. These measures should appeal to the good will and common sense of the citizens
statewide, resulting in behavioral changes that will improve community livability, which can be
a source of pride for all Kentuckians.
Goals
•

The objective will be to increase public awareness of these issues by 10% by 2020 and an
additional 10% by 2030. The goal of the education and outreach program will be to raise
awareness of the public to issues that may directly or indirectly influence GHG production
and its implications for corresponding climate change. The level of public understanding will
be measured through a statewide survey at the outset of the program to establish baseline
conditions. The survey will be designed to measure awareness through numerical scoring of
responses.

•

The Smart Cycling initiative will be intended to reduce bicycle/vehicle conflicts and will be
measured by doubling the number of counties where there are certified LCIs by 2020.
Additional goals related to bicyclists’ fatality and injury rates resulting from vehicle conflict
may also be considered.

Timing: Early development and execution of the baseline survey will be critical to establish
existing conditions. Frequency of follow-up surveys will be determined by the implementing
agency at an interval sufficient to develop meaningful feedback and support an iterative
approach to program modification and improvement.
There currently are five counties with at least one certified LCI. Expansion of this population
would likely be influenced by the ability to secure training at localities statewide.
Parties Involved: To develop and manage a statewide educational program, the Governor’s
Office may establish a focus group, task force, advisory commission, or advisory committee that
will consist, at a minimum, of representatives from KYTC, the Kentucky Energy and
Environment Cabinet (KEEC), CED, and the Kentucky Education and Workforce Development
H-38

Cabinet. A Key Stakeholders Group may also include representatives of the Kentucky
Broadcasters Association (KBA), Kentucky print media, the auto insurance industry, KPTA, and
the Kentucky State Police (KSP), as well as other public or private organizations that may be
identified as key to the success of the education program. The purpose of the group will be to
oversee and administer a public education program to modify behaviors and promote change to
reduce GHG emissions. KYTC will be responsible for the execution of the program.
The program developers may seek the involvement of the Kentucky Environmental Education
Council for its skill in delivering educational programs to schools and the public in general, as
well as its experience conducting statewide surveys regarding public knowledge. Partnering of
the program with other existing programs having similar or related messages, such as the KSP
Click-It or Ticket and the KYTC Highway Safety program will also be advantageous. Measures
addressing education of new drivers through modification of the Kentucky Driver Manual would
also require the involvement and cooperation of the KSP.
To advance and promote bicycling education, the League of American Cyclists, area cycling
clubs, and the public may be involved.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
The Governor’s Office may establish a focus group, task force, advisory commission, or
advisory committee that will address implementation of a public education program to inform
citizens on this complex issue. A Key Stakeholders Group consisting, at a minimum, of
representatives from KYTC, KEEC, CED, and the Education Cabinet should be empanelled to
specifically address educational needs related to transportation and land use. Recommendations
of this panel should be considered and coordinated with other educational initiatives being
conducted on the climate change issue. A Key Stakeholders Group may also include
representatives of KBA, Kentucky print media, the auto insurance industry, KPTA, and the KSP
as well as other public or private organizations that may be identified as key to the success of the
education program. The purpose of the Key Stakeholders Group will be to oversee and
administer a public education program to modify behaviors and promote change to reduce GHG
emissions and climate change.
The Key Stakeholders Group will commission the development and implementation of a
statewide survey that assesses the understanding of the general public regarding personal
behavior and decisions that influence GHG production and climate change, as well as knowledge
of the effects of land use decisions on resource consumption. This may be incorporated within an
existing surveying effort conducted by the Kentucky Environmental Education Council or may
be conducted independently. Additional surveys will be conducted in future years to gauge the
effectiveness of the proposed educational campaigns.
The Key Stakeholders Group will consider effective means for addressing desired modification
to public behavior, including:
•

Mass media campaigns using print, radio, and television media. KBA may be a key partner in
this initiative.

H-39

•

Modification of the materials studied for the driver licensing examination to include benefits
of eco-driving and a “share the road” message. The KSP will be integral to this objective.

•

Partnering with existing organizations with similar goals and objectives to the extent
practicable to make the best possible use of available funds.

•

Establishing a driver education requirement in the public school curriculum that would
provide education on the benefits of using eco-friendly driving techniques and the
importance of proper maintenance to reduce fuel consumption and emissions, in addition to
addressing the rules of the road. An emphasis on the corresponding safety benefits of these
measures should also be incorporated.

•

Working with the County Clerks Association to disseminate information on the benefits of
green driving when drivers’ licenses or vehicle tags are renewed.

•

Working with the auto insurance industry to develop cost incentives or discounts for people
who have completed eco-friendly driving and Share the Road training that should both
reduce emissions and improve safety.

•

Establishing a Smart Cycling program that will expand bicycling education opportunities
throughout the state, and promoting a Share the Road educational program for drivers.

The source of funding for the educational program should be established by the Governor’s
Office. The Key Stakeholders Group will identify and make best use of other available funding
opportunities, including public–private partnerships, grants, and other related federal funding
sources to promote its message of change. One possible revenue stream for this program is the
creation of a “Drive Smart–Drive Green” specialty license plate, similar to those benefiting the
Share the Road program and the Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund.

TLU-7. Parking Management and Ride Sharing

Policy Description
This strategy will reduce GHG emissions and lower fuel consumption by reducing the number of
SOV trips, resulting in reduced VMT. Parking management refers to policies and programs that
result in more efficient use of parking resources. Reserved and preferential parking for HOVs
near places of employment will further provide incentives to reduce SOV trips. HOV parking
may be reserved at preferential locations, such as near building entrances or parking garage exits.
Free or reduced-fee parking for HOVs may also be provided. Similarly, preferential parking and
incentives can also be offered to drivers of vehicles with low GHG emission rates. Depending on
effectiveness, these incentives could include preferential vehicle access to metered parking
spaces or HOV lanes.
Providing safe, convenient park-and-ride lots will facilitate the use of carpooling, vanpooling,
and transit. The most utilized park-and-ride lots are those that are in highly visible locations, are
police-patrolled, and have direct access to transit if available. Locating park-and-rides near
HOV-only highway lanes would complement this strategy. Promoting carpooling and
vanpooling through rideshare matching, marketing, and public awareness increases the success
of shifting to HOVs for work trips. Regional ride-matching programs provide a centralized
database for matching drivers with others with similar commute schedules, origins, and
destinations.
Policy Design
An effective policy for parking management and carpooling will encourage more efficient travel
choices. This is accomplished by facilitating the shift to HOVs, providing for the safety and
security of HOV travelers, and encouraging the use of low-GHG-emitting vehicles.
Goals: Goals for this policy are as follows (from a 2005 baseline):
•

Provide additional state funding for studies/plans and for design and construction of parkand-ride lots.

•

Increase the number of park-and-ride spaces by 50% by 2030.

•

Increase the utilization of existing park-and-ride facilities.

•

Increase the number of carpool and vanpool participants by 75% by 2030.

•

Increase funding for regional and state ride-matching programs.

•

Recommend standards for local jurisdictions to reserve parking spaces, provide transit or
park-and-ride facilities, or offer free or reduced parking rates for HOVs and low-GHG
vehicles.

Timing: 2010–2030.

H-42

Parties Involved: Kentucky legislature, KYTC, parking authorities and parking departments,
local transit operators, local governments, MPOs, ADDs, other community agencies, commuters,
and large employers.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Conduct studies and develop plans to locate and build additional park-and-ride lots to
encourage and enable increased carpooling, vanpooling, and transit ridership.

•

Improve the security and accessibility of existing park-and-ride facilities.

•

Fund and conduct studies to develop efficient successful methods to facilitate the use of
HOVs (e.g., preferential parking facilities and monitoring systems for enforcement).

•

Develop and fund marketing strategies and incentives to promote the use of HOVs and
ridesharing.

•

Provide additional funding for regional ride-matching services.

•

Build regional rideshare matching databases on the same platform to ensure accurate and
easier tracking of participation goals.

•

Improve the existing state ride-matching system.

•

Fund regional guaranteed-ride-home programs. Such programs typically offer registered
carpool and vanpool commuters a partial reimbursement of the cost of cab fare or transit fare
home.

•

Provide incentives and fund associations or networks for transit or transportation
coordination and management.

•

Provide various effective incentives and strategies to businesses/employers and individuals to
encourage or use ridesharing, carpools and vanpools, and transit.

•

Provide employer outreach, education, and technical assistance, especially for large
employers. Employer outreach may include information on tax incentives and providing
reserved/preferred parking for HOV and low-GHG vehicles, as well as parking cash-out
options.

•

Encourage text amendments to ordinances and regulations that promote or require new
developments and redevelopments to include transit and park-and-ride facilities and
reserved/preferred parking for HOV and low-GHG vehicles.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Rideshare, vanpool, and mobility programs exist in some of the larger MPOs operating in
Lexington, Louisville, and northern Kentucky. There is also an existing state ride-matching
system. This policy would support these programs already in place. An education and outreach
component of this policy should be combined with promoting better vehicle maintenance, idle
reduction, eco-driving, and alternative modes of travel (TLU-5). Where public transportation is
available, the addition of park-and-ride lots is to be coordinated with public transit agencies.

Quantification Methods: This policy includes multiple components; however only the
increased participation in carpooling and vanpooling for work trips with the help of employee
support programs has been quantitatively analyzed. While other elements are mentioned as subcomponents, they are not addressed explicitly in this analysis. The quantitative analysis is a
conservative estimate because it only includes a subset of implementation strategies. As a result,
the potential for GHG emission reductions and energy savings may be larger than the
conservative estimates provided indicate.
For the carpool components, the following projected goal is identified in the POD and was used
to calculate the associated emission reductions: Increase the number of carpool and vanpool
participants by 75% by 2030 for work trips. The participation in carpooling and vanpooling and
preferential parking was assumed to apply to all CBDs in the state with employment and
population rates greater than 20,000 people. These cities include:
•

Louisville

•

Lexington

•

Bowling Green

•

Cities and rural areas with employment and populations below 20,000 were not considered in the
analysis. The analysts created a forecast to the year 2030 for employment using historic data
from 2005 to 2009 from the Workforce Kentucky Web site 25 for the following cities:
•

Louisville

•

Lexington

•

Bowling Green

•

Elizabethtown

•

Frankfort

The growth rates used for forecasting the employment to 2030 were taken from the Workforce
Kentucky Web site. The rest of the analysis was completed using the EPA COMMUTER
Model, 26 as well as spreadsheet-based analysis. Individual runs using the 2005 employment
baseline and the employment forecast to 2030 for metropolitan areas, such as Louisville,
Lexington, Bowling Green, and Frankfort, were completed using the EPA COMMUTER Model.
The rate of increased participation in ridesharing was assumed to be 75% by 2030 from a 2005
baseline, with carpool programs being implemented in 2011. The EPA COMMUTER Model
allows for local inputs, such as average time of driving to work in an SOV or in a carpool
arrangement, and the user can specify local mode-share inputs.
The EPA COMMUTER Model created a baseline daily VMT estimate, and a scenario ramp-up
of daily VMT was also created. The daily VMT savings of increased carpool participation were
converted to reflect yearly estimates assuming 240 work days per year. Emission factors and full
fuel factors from AEO 2009 were applied to the yearly VMT savings to create estimates for

MMtCO2e emissions saved as well as fuel savings. These steps were completed for the five cities
mentioned above.
Since workforce data were not readily available for the cities with a population between 20,000
and 40,000 employees, a factor for estimating the impacts was created using the Frankfort data
as a basis. A ratio of employment to population was created for Frankfort and was applied to the
population data available for the remaining 13 small cities to estimate the total affected
employment in that area. The sum of the estimated number of employees for the 13 small cities
was then used to estimate total emission savings by extrapolating from the Frankfort example.
The same process was repeated to estimate the impacts of increased carpool participation in the
city of Owensboro with a population between 50,000 and 60,000 using Bowling Green as the
example.
In addition to GHG emission savings, the analysts also considered vehicle cost savings of 41
cents (2005$) per mile from the AAA Web site. 27 Additional costs were assumed to be an annual
program administration cost of $2,600 (2005$) per employer for carpool programs. The analysts
used data from city-specific Web sites to consider the number of employers with more than 100
employees that would implement a carpooling program for their employees. Only employers
with more than 100 employees were assumed to implement a carpooling program.
Finally, the cost and GHG reduction estimates for the small cities was added to the individual
estimates for Louisville and Lexington City, as well as to the estimates of Bowling Green and
Owensboro. Table TLU-7-2 summarizes the final results for a 75% increase in carpooling and
vanpooling.

TLU-8. Strategies to Move Freight in More GHG-Efficient Ways

Policy Description
Trucking continues to deliver a majority of the freight in the United States and Kentucky. On a
national level, the trucking industry delivers over 70% (by weight) of all the freight transported.
In Kentucky, over 72% of the freight tonnage and over 90% of all commodities are delivered by
truck. Existing infrastructure makes it unlikely that this distribution will be significantly changed
at any point in the near future. According to the ATA, the freight forecast predicts freight
tonnage being moved by truck will continue to increase over the next several years. Kentucky
can make significant strides in improving the efficiency and environmental impact of the
necessary freight movements within its boundaries and current infrastructure.
Shifting freight from trucks to river and rail will decrease impacts on highway infrastructure, and
will reduce GHG emissions and particulate matter.
The development of warehouses or distribution in the rural areas surrounding the larger cities in
Kentucky is needed to improve inefficiencies within the supply chain. With additional square
footage of distribution space, the ability to coordinate freight movements in non-peak times will
increase, resulting in a reduction of congestion and emissions.
Policy Design
These latest efforts to improve air quality continue a nearly quarter-century trend of reducing
truck emissions. In 2002 (the most current year for which data are available), on-road diesel
engines contributed approximately 1% of the nation's total emissions of volatile organic
compounds, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide; less than 1.5% of the nation's total emissions
of fine particulate matter; and approximately 16% of the nation's total emissions of nitrogen
oxides. 34 Fine particulate emissions from on-road diesel engines have been cut by more than half
over the past decade.
Even with all the improvements in emission control systems, the challenge of significantly
improving GHG emissions in the trucking industry is still very difficult. The vast majority (97%)
of the motor carriers across the United States have 20 or fewer trucks. Many smaller trucking
companies are unable to afford the upgrades and add-ons that would make a significant impact
on their fuel efficiency and consumption. The bottom line is that most of these small companies
that are operating on-road or off-road equipment have no capital, and their ability to obtain credit
is limited.
Intermodal freight transportation is expanding across the United States every year. The ATA
projects the largest increases in tonnage hauled will occur over the next 20 years. Intermodal
freight movement can be more efficient than moving that same freight by a single mode of
transport, depending on the distance, weight, and time sensitivity of the shipment. The tonnage
of freight moved by intermodal transportation in Kentucky is well below the national average.

Goal: Increase participation in the SmartWay program by 10%.

•

Provide tax incentives and rebates to trucking companies to encourage:
o The purchase and installation of devices that eliminate the need to idle, including battery
electric auxiliary power systems, vehicle battery systems, thermal energy storage
systems, fueled auxiliary power systems, automatic tire-inflation systems, diesel
oxidation catalysts, diesel particulate filters, on-board plug-in systems, hydrogen systems,
and trailer fairings.
o Investment in hybrid truck and alternative fuel technologies as they become available in
class 7 and class 8 trucks over the next 3 years and beyond.

H-51

•

Research the possibility of changes in truck weight and configuration restrictions to
maximize trip efficiency.
Mechanism: Kentucky/Local Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration/KSP will research
the possibility of increasing weight restrictions in Kentucky. Research should examine
different modes of truck transport and routes where additional weight creates no harmful
effects to safety or highway maintenance. Increasing overweight permit fees should also be
explored.
Goal: Move freight more efficiently in certain transportation segments. Seek to increase road
funding by 10% through increased overweight permit fees.

Mechanism: Conduct research to develop effective incentives for the development and
operation of more privately owned and operated truck layover/parking facilities.
Goal: Reduce unnecessary truck/freight VMT and idling by providing more privately
owned/operated truck delivery/parking facilities. Locate these facilities close to delivery
points to enable drivers and carriers to more efficiently deliver freight and meet required rest
periods, therefore reducing VMT, idling, and GHG emissions.

•

Encourage railroad and river capital investment to increase capacity and efficiency. KYTC
will continue to support and expand such initiatives as:
o Federal tax credit to Class 1 railroads, short-line railroads, river transport operators, and
intermodal terminals.

H-52

o Public–private partnerships to expand freight river and rail capacity.
o State tax credits to Class 2 and Class 3 railroads.
o Protect future funding.
Mechanism: Kentucky will work with all the stakeholders on developing ways to expand
railroad and river capacity. Kentucky will explore different funding opportunities and work
with KYTC on areas of development, and with the goods movement industry on defining and
increasing opportunities. Kentucky should support federal funding of the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers to find ways to maintain and improve the locks and dams in the inland waterway
system.
Goal: Expand rail and river freight transport capacity by 10%.
•

Adopt progressive performance standards for rail, truck, terminal equipment, and watergoing vessels.

RailRunner, Maglev, and virtual container yards. Collaboration could include state grant
funding, tax incentives, and public–private partnerships.
Mechanism: Kentucky, MPOs, private financing groups, the goods movement industry, and
research institutes will work together to encourage public–private partnerships to develop
and test new technologies. Tax incentives and penalties, tariffs, performance standards, and
freight fees will encourage private investment. Kentucky will lobby for more federal grants
and incentive funding.
Goal: Reduce carbon emissions by 20% at these locations.

•

Kentucky, MPOs, private financing companies, and trucking companies will collaborate on
low-to-zero emissions truck technology, including hybrid and electric engines. Collaboration
could include state grant funding, tax incentives, and public–private partnerships.
Mechanism: Kentucky, MPOs, private financing groups, the goods movement industry, and

•

Kentucky will adopt and/or enforce anti-idling regulations for trucks and trains where
appropriate.

H-53

Mechanism: Kentucky, MPOs, private financing groups, the goods movement industry, and
research institutes will work together to encourage public–private partnerships to develop
policies, ordinance, or laws. Land use policies, tax incentives and penalties, tariffs,
performance standards, and freight fees will encourage private investment. Kentucky will

industry.
o Developing marine, rail, and air terminal electrification projects.
o Creating a Clean Truck Program, with eventual move to electric trucks/zero-emissions
container movers.
The strategy will be administered through leases, incentives, and tariffs, and financed
through grants, freight fees, and public–private partnerships.
Goal: Reduce carbon emissions by 20%.

•

Kentucky will encourage clean diesel retrofits. Diesel vehicles are often more fuel efficient
than their gasoline-powered counterparts, but have traditionally been higher emitters of other
air pollutants, including black carbon, a potential GHG. New diesel vehicles, however, are
manufactured to meet much more stringent emissions standards. Additionally, retrofit
technologies are available for almost all older diesel applications that can reduce harmful air
pollution. These retrofits allow the owner to enjoy the fuel efficiency benefits and reduced
emissions from clean diesel technologies, without having to replace the diesel vehicle.
Different approaches from those that would be used to encourage new clean vehicle purchase
may be needed to incentivize the application of retrofit technologies.
Mechanism:
o Outreach and Education—Raising awareness of the emission reduction possibilities of
retrofits and the resulting health benefits may encourage owners to retrofit existing diesel
vehicles and equipment.
o Grant Programs—These types of programs provide a financial incentive to retrofit,
repower, or replace equipment by covering the cost of the new technology. For an
example, see: http://www.air.ky.gov/homepage_repository/Kentucky+Clean+
Diesel+Grant+Program.htm.
o Financing Assistance—These types of programs provide a financial incentive to retrofit,
repower, or replace equipment by lowering the cost of the new technology. For an
example, see: http://www.louisvilleky.gov/economicdevelopment/businessdevelopment/
GreenIncentives.htm (POWER Loan).

This analysis focused on four specific efficiency and emissions-reduction strategies discussed in
the “Implementation Mechanisms” section. Three are under the umbrella of technologies
approved and promoted as part of the EPA’s SmartWay program. Those four strategies are as
follows:
SmartWay strategies:
•

Trailer fairings to reduce wind resistance.

•

Auxiliary power units (APUs) to reduce demand for engine idling.

•

On-board automatic tire-inflation units.

Other strategy:
•

Weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology allowing truck weight compliance checks without
stopping vehicles at weigh stations.

Each technology has a different level of impact on emissions. Trailer fairings were found by one
study to achieve an average fuel efficiency gain of approximately 6%. APUs, which do not affect
efficiency on the road, reduce idling by several hours a night on average, and result in a similarly
large overall efficiency improvement. Tire-inflation units have a smaller impact, and WIM
technology achieves idling reduction on a per-transaction basis, rather than on a per-vehicle
basis.

With regard to costs, each achieves fuel savings, but also involves expenses for equipment. The
following equipment costs were estimated:
•

Trailer Fairings: Fairings vary widely in cost, but two different estimates placed typical
costs at approximately $2,200 to upgrade a single trailer.

•

APUs: Three sources put the cost of APUs at between $6,000 and $7,000 per unit. These
units are capable of providing cabin heat, cabin air conditioning, and electricity to both the
vehicle’s electrical system and other devices. Smaller units, capable only of producing cabin
heat, were not considered for this analysis.

•

On-Board Tire-Inflation Units: Two estimates averaged to a cost of $545 per unit. The unit is
attached to the trailer and regulates tire pressure on the trailer tires, or to the non-steering
tires of a single-unit truck.

•

WIM Equipment: Several sources established an average cost of approximately $6,200 to
install necessary equipment at a single weigh station. Kentucky already provides
transponders for such a program free of charge to heavy-duty vehicle (HDV) owners, at an
estimated cost of $40 per transponder. Additionally, private contracts to operate WIM
systems average approximately $400,000 per year.

H-57

Fairings and APUs achieved significant fuel and emission savings, resulting in a net cost savings
from the reduced fuel expenditure that overwhelms the equipment cost. Tire-inflation units and
WIM technology achieved smaller impacts, resulting in less of an offset against their costs. As
shown in Table TLU-8-5, annual costs stay fairly stable, while fuel savings each year climb with
adoption rates.

Quantification Methods
The quantitative analysis is a conservative estimate because it only includes a subset of
implementation strategies. As a result, the potential for GHG emission reductions and energy
savings may be larger than the conservative estimates provided indicate.
The strategy sought to achieve 10% reduction in GHG emissions from the BAU projection by
2030. When considering that the potential of all four technologies summed together reaches
approximately 13% improvement in vehicle efficiency, the strategy design was made very
aggressive. WIM technology was assumed to reach installation at all 17 of Kentucky’s weigh

H-58

stations, and to be in operation every day of the year. SmartWay technologies were assumed to
reach 100% rates of installation on the HDVs registered in Kentucky.
The quantification method for this analysis relies on the VISION model, which is a
transportation energy and emissions model developed and updated every year by ANL. The
model is built around a detailed perpetual-inventory model of the national vehicle fleet. A great
deal of detail can be customized in this tool with regard to fleet size and makeup, driver
behavior, fuels characteristics and levels of use, and emission factors.
This model is first adjusted to represent only Kentucky’s share of fuel use and VMT in the
heavy-duty sector, using FHWA historical data, and is then calibrated for this analysis with data
from the Kentucky CAP inventory and forecast. HDV-specific baselines for emissions, energy
use, and VMT were developed in this process.
The efficiency gains from SmartWay technologies were developed by assuming gradual rampups of application to the HDV fleet registered in Kentucky. This produced a fleetwide average
impact on vehicle efficiency from each technology. The impacts grew at different rates as the
ramp-ups assumed were different. The average impacts for each year of the scenario (2011–
2030) were combined and applied to the model. Emissions and energy savings were extracted
from the model, and converted to fuel savings and fuel costs using AEO 2009 data and full fuelcycle energy-content estimates developed by DOE.
The efficiency gains for WIM technology adoption were developed independently, utilizing cost
and emission numbers and estimates for technology adoption rates.
Key Assumptions
•

The rate of adoption for the three SmartWay technologies was assumed to be equal. For each
APU installed on a truck, one other truck was assumed to install fairings, and one truck was
assumed to install automatic tire-inflation technology. The analysis was not weighted in
favor of or against technologies based on either emissions impact or cost.

•

Approximately 12.5% of HDVs registered in Kentucky, or one of every eight, is assumed to
have the SmartWay technologies in place. The scenario involves increasing adoption,
reaching full adoption by all Kentucky-registered trucks in 2030.

Key Uncertainties
•

The impact on truck tonnage is uncertain. Even with increasing the freight tonnage
transported by intermodal, rail, or river, the overall impact in Kentucky is minimal.

•

The efficiency equipment considered in this strategy analysis undergoes significant
environmental forces, and is likely to incur wear and tear, requiring eventual replacement.
Without data on scrappage rates or life spans, no replacement costs were included in this
analysis; however, most of the equipment considered for this analysis is likely to eventually
need replacement.

H-59

Additional Benefits and Costs
This policy will also decrease impacts on highway infrastructure and reduce emissions of
particulate matter, including black carbon. The improvement in efficiencies in the movement of
freight within Kentucky’s boundaries and current infrastructure will reduce the impact of
harmful emissions.
Improvements in HDV efficiency, as well as reductions in idling, will also mitigate the negative
consequences that result from the emissions of criteria pollutants. Although these pollutants,
such as black carbon and carbon monoxide, are not always considered to be GHG pollutants,
they do have other negative impacts, particularly on public health. Reductions in these pollutants
will have significant positive impacts on health issues and air quality outside of the reductions in
GHG emissions.
The improvement in efficiencies in the movement of freight within Kentucky’s boundaries and a
decrease in unnecessary idling will also lessen the freight sector’s impact on highway
infrastructure. These policies will also reduce emissions of criteria air pollutants. Criteria air
pollutants are ones for which the EPA has set National Ambient Air Quality Standards and are
those generally associated with regulated emission standards. These pollutants, such as ozone,
particulate matter, and carbon monoxide, have adverse effects on human health. Strategies that
reduce criteria pollutant emissions will also result in significant public health benefits and air
quality improvements in addition to GHG reductions.
Diesel particulate matter (PM) contains significant amounts of black carbon, 35 which has been
increasingly implicated as a contributor to climate change. Diesel PM is also listed by EPA as a
mobile source air toxic due to its cancer and noncancer health effects, making diesel PM an even
greater concern to public health. As evidenced by the SmartWay program, several years of
continued funding for diesel emission reduction grant programs, and an increasing number of
idle reduction mandates nationwide, addressing diesel PM emissions has become a pressing
public health priority.

TLU-9. Promote Consumption of Locally Produced Goods and Services

Policy Description
Today it is often more convenient to buy distantly produced goods (including food), which at
face value appear to be cheaper. Indeed, most produce in the United States is picked four to
seven days before being placed on supermarket shelves, and is shipped for an average of 1,500
miles before being sold. However, these “cheaper” goods are not always less expensive, as there
are hidden economic, environmental, and societal costs related to transporting distant products.
This policy supports “buy local” programs, like the Kentucky Proud marketing campaign, which
promotes local cycling of dollars and resources, and reduces the need to haul freight. While
“local” is a relative term, for the purpose of this policy we are considering local to mean made in
Kentucky, since this is a statewide CAP. 36
Policy Design
This policy will work by promoting and facilitating the purchase of local goods (particularly
agriculture) and services produced in Kentucky. It will build on current initiatives wherever
possible, such as the Kentucky Department of Agriculture’s (KDA’s) Kentucky Proud program,
and may also entail creating new partnerships and initiatives.
Goals: The overarching goal is to reduce heavy-duty freight VMT by 5% below current
projected levels by 2025.
The methodological approach will first involve developing estimates for the economic volume of
the shift from foreign products and food to Kentucky-produced products and food. Once the
amount of this shift is established, a factor will be established to allow the economic shift to
indicate a reduction in imported freight transportation and an increase in intrastate freight
transportation. From this change, an estimate of total heavy-duty and medium-duty VMT
avoided as a result of the policy will be established. Once an estimate of the VMT reduction
from the freight sector is established, use of the Kentucky VISION tool and emission factors
from GREET will allow for estimation of the GHG reduction potential of these strategies.
Schools
Goal #1
•

Increase the number of public school districts participating in the “Farm to School” program
to promote the use of locally grown foods in all K–12 public school lunch programs.
Currently, 39 counties are participating per the KDA Web site. The aim is to have 50
counties participating by 2015 and all 120 counties participating by 2030.

Timing: The project would begin in 2012. It would be partly implemented by 2015 and fully
implemented by 2030.

farmers. Affected parties: Students, cafeteria staff.
Implementation Mechanisms: Work with stakeholders in a concerted effort to ensure
agriculture is incorporated into school curriculum. Identify and expand opportunities for students
to obtain hands-on educational experience by touring local farms. 37
Key Uncertainties: The level of support/funding, the ability of local farmers to supply the
amount of food needed on consistent basis, and the lack of facilities (infrastructure) to prepare
food.
Related Policies and Programs in Place: Farm to School program.
Goal #2
•

Incorporate agriculture into the K–12 curriculum.

Timing: The project would begin in 2012 and would be fully implemented by 2015.
Parties Involved: Kentucky Education Cabinet, KDA, local school districts, teachers. Affected
parties: Students.
Implementation Mechanisms: Clark County is Kentucky’s model program for integrating Farm
to School with nutrition and health education. The county is developing and piloting the Clover
CAT (Cooking, Activity, and Time to be well) curriculum, which includes nutrition, time
management, exercise, and self-esteem. The curriculum is being piloted in the 5th, 7th, and 9th
grades with respective introductory, intermediate, and advanced levels. The implementation
strategy would be to replicate this model program into additional Kentucky schools and to
expand this curriculum to include agriculture education and gardens located on school grounds. 38
Key Uncertainties: The level of support/funding, the ability of educators to allot classroom time
for this effort, and whether the program developed would support and be integrated into required
curriculum.
Related Policies and Programs in Place: Clover CAT curriculum.
Economic Development
Goal #3
•

Encourage local governments to buy locally produced products by 2012. This project would
build upon the mandates for state agencies to buy locally grown agricultural products,
including wood products, under HB 669.

Implementation Mechanisms: Educate local purchasing coordinators regarding the benefits of
buying locally (through workshops, etc.), and remove barriers to buying locally. Identify
Kentucky-made products and services on the state master price contract, so that municipalities
can use this information during their selection of vendors. 39 Also ask the legislature to pass
legislation specifically allowing city and county governments to consider “local” when
determining best bids.
Key Uncertainties: The availability of locally produced products, and whether buying local
products would significantly increase costs to local governments.
Related Policies and Programs in Place: HB 669 and amendment to KRS 45A.645: “Agencies
to purchase Kentucky-grown products meeting quality standards and pricing requirements if
available.” Also climate protection plans and transportation plans that use similar initiatives to
lower VMT.
Goal #4
•

Create a “Made in Kentucky” logo/brand for nonagricultural products to complement the
Kentucky Proud brand, or expand the Kentucky Proud brand to more nonagricultural
products if practical.

Timing: The project would build upon current KDA and CED efforts. Implementation would
begin in 2013 and continue annually.
Parties Involved: Producers, Kentucky legislature, KDA, CED, and Kentucky Department of
Tourism. Affected parties: Citizens.
Implementation Mechanisms: Create branding similar to Kentucky Proud to denote products
that are made in Kentucky for nonagricultural products. An alternate mechanism would be to use
Kentucky Proud for nonagricultural products. Develop an outreach strategy to educate the public
about the benefits of buying locally. Have CED and KDA identify additional products made in
Kentucky, and post this information on their Web sites.
Key Uncertainties: Possible concern for watering down/competing with the Kentucky Proud
brand.

Ask CED and KDA (with the assistance of universities) to study and contrast the economic
benefits of buying locally versus distantly produced foods and products (if this has not been
done already), to include identifying distances that food typically travels, quantifying carbon
emissions, cycling of dollars, and similar issues.

Timing: The project would begin in 2012 and would be completed by 2013.
Parties Involved: Kentucky legislature, CED, KDA. Affected parties: Citizens.
Implementation Mechanisms: Work with the legislature to request such a study and provide
funding to conduct the study (possibly to universities).
Key Uncertainties: The availability of funding/resources to complete the study.

Goal #6
•

Identify needs and facilitate the establishment of infrastructure needed for efficient transport,
storage, and processing of local foods throughout Kentucky.

Timing: The project would be implemented by 2015.
Parties Involved: KDA, Kentucky Agriculture Extension Service, farmers. Affected parties:
Citizens.
Implementation Mechanisms: Ask KDA to use its resources and university resources to study
and identify problem areas and bottlenecks that hinder access to locally grown foods, if these
issues have not already been examined. The study would also investigate whether community
kitchens could be established to allow local foods to be prepared in a centralized location and
then distributed to nonprofit organizations and community groups, as well as for-profit
organizations (for a fee). This could reduce kitchen labor significantly and achieve economies of
scale that would result in more local produce being distributed. As an example, Jefferson County
Public Schools has established a central kitchen that prepares food that is subsequently
transported to individual schools.
Key Uncertainties: The availability of funds to establish the required infrastructure.
Related Policies and Programs in Place: Homeland security (food security) and economic
development.

Timing: Ongoing efforts would be expanded.
Parties Involved: KDA, CHFS. Affected parties: Citizens.
Implementation Mechanisms: Provide additional outreach to the 102 farmers’ markets to
increase acceptance of EBT. 42 Also investigate whether a statewide farmers’ market EBT
program could be established. Technology advancements will also have to be monitored (for
example, if the ability to conduct transactions using a cell phone becomes common, then EBT
may not be necessary).
Related Policies and Programs in Place: Farmers’ markets, community-supported agriculture
(CSA) farms.

•

Provide local health departments with literature and training on gardening and gardening
resources, as well as locations of farmers’ markets, food banks, and area stores where locally
grown produce can be obtained for dissemination to the public.

Timing: The project would be implemented by 2012.
Parties Involved: KDA, CHFS, local health departments, Agriculture Extension Service (Ag
Extension), community organizations. Affected parties: Citizens.
Implementation Mechanisms: Develop a coordinated, uniform educational and outreach
campaign that could be used by health departments throughout the state to encourage more
people to grow their own food, and educate them about where to find fresh produce. Partner with
the Ag Extension and universities on this initiative.
Key Uncertainties: The availability of resources/funding to conduct this outreach.
Related Policies and Programs in Place: Ag Extension.
Goal #11
•

Establish legislation that would encourage local governments to establish community
gardens. Specifically, exempt local governments from liability associated with use of
municipal land for community gardens to make establishing community gardens on public
lands more attractive. The goal would be to have a community garden for every 10,000 urban
residents by 2020 and one for every 5,000 urban residents by 2030.

Timing: The project would begin being implemented by 2012 and would continue through 2030.

information on a central Web site. 43 Model Kentucky efforts after municipalities and states that
already have extensive community garden programs and procedures in place.
Key Uncertainties: The availability of land in urban environment, potential liability issues, the
protocol for ensuring garden space is allotted fairly, preventing use of contaminated properties
for gardening, the maintenance of gardens at end of the year, the application of pesticides near
waterways.
Related Policies and Programs in Place: Homeland security (food security); gleaning
networks, such as the Lexington Urban Gleaning Network; food banks, churches, and
community garden groups.
Goal #12
•

Facilitate establishment of local Food Policy Councils (FPCs) throughout Kentucky as well
as a statewide FPC. FPCs bring together stakeholders from diverse food-related sectors to
examine how the food system is operating and to develop recommendations on how to
improve it. FPCs may take many forms, but typically either are commissioned by state or
local government, or are predominately a grassroots effort. FPCs would in all likelihood be
supportive of and facilitate the other goals outlined in TLU-9.

Timing: The project would be started in 2012 and completed by 2020.
Parties Involved: KDA, Ag Extension, community organizations. Affected parties: Farmers,
citizens.
Implementation Mechanisms: Ask KDA to use its resources and networking to establish FPCs
(beginning in larger communities and then progressively smaller communities). 44
Key Uncertainties: The level of acceptance/support, resources, ability to implement
policies/effect change (particularly across county lines).

GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; tCO2e =

This GHG reduction strategy, focusing on several efforts to encourage consumption of
Kentucky-produced goods and services, was envisioned as an overall effort seeking to reduce
VMT from heavy-duty trucks within Kentucky by 5% below the BAU projection by 2025.
Because the period of analysis for the Kentucky CAP process is 2011 through 2030, analysts
extended the impact of the policy beyond 2025 (the stated year by which the target would be
reached) to 2030. This produced a VMT reduction scenario that grows from no change in 2010
to 5% in 2025, and continues to achieve 5% reductions from BAU VMT in 2026 through 2030.
GHG reductions track very closely with VMT reductions in the analysis results, as was expected.
Emissions fell almost exactly 5% from BAU in 2025, and remained there as the 5% target
remained in place for the last five years of the analysis. The total number of tons avoided grew in
that time, as the BAU scenario projects greater and greater heavy-duty VMT throughout the next
20 years. As a consequence, a constant percentage reduction off of a growing baseline results in
a reduction that grows when measured in total tons. Table TLU-9-2 shows the projected scenario
impacts expected every five years, and demonstrates that reductions grow from 2025 and 2030,
despite a constant percentage reduction in VMT.

(measured in 2007 dollars). They grow to $126 million by 2025, and grow further to $147
million by 2030.
Data Sources
•

Heavy-duty VMT volumes, both historical and projected, were taken from the inventory and
forecast developed as part of this CAP.

•

Fuel price projections for all fuels related to this strategy were drawn from DOE’s AEO
2009, which was released in early 2010.

•

Assumptions regarding the fuel efficiency of various truck classes, scrappage rates for aging
vehicles, and VMT changes corresponding to vehicle age were taken from projections
developed by DOE and ANL.

Quantification Methods
The quantification method for this analysis relies on the VISION model, which is a
transportation energy and emissions model developed and updated every year by ANL. The
model is built around a detailed perpetual-inventory model of the national vehicle fleet. A great
deal of detail can be customized in this tool with regard to fleet size and makeup, driver
behavior, fuels characteristics and levels of use, and emission factors.
This model is first adjusted to represent only Kentucky’s share of fuel use and VMT in the
heavy-duty sector, using FHWA historical data and then calibrated for this analysis with data
from the Kentucky CAP inventory and forecast. HDV-specific baselines for emissions, energy
use, and VMT were developed in this process.
The scenario assumptions regarding VMT reduction were applied within the model to both
medium-duty vehicles (representing truck classes three through six) and HDVs (representing
classes seven and eight). Energy and GHG impacts were assessed by comparison of new
projections to the HDV-specific baseline projections. Energy impacts were converted to fuel
savings, both in gallons and in dollars of expenditure.
Key Assumptions: The fuel efficiency of the heavy-duty fleet is projected to improve slightly
but steadily over the next 20 years.
Key Uncertainties
Key uncertainties include the level of support/involvement in these programs. Further, the
potential program costs are uncertain and depend on the levels of support. While some programs
have relatively fixed and minor costs, such as outreach campaigns, other programs (such as
subsidies or regulations requiring enforcement) may have high and varying costs that are subject
to change as legislative and agency priorities evolve.
Additional Benefits and Costs
There can be hidden economic, environmental, and societal costs in terms of transportation,
packaging, reliance on pesticides, loss of local jobs, cycling of money outside the local

H-69

community, loss of sense of community and community fabric, health impacts, and climate
change.
Although buy-local initiatives are sometimes viewed as “protectionism,” in many respects
buying locally allows communities to preserve and protect their heritage and way of life and to
become more sustainable. The New Economics Foundation, an independent economic think tank
based in London, compared what happens when people buy produce at a supermarket versus a
local farmers’ market or CSA program, and found that twice the money stayed in the community
when people bought locally. 45
Reduced heavy-duty VMT, particularly around large cities, can reduce congestion, saving both
time and fuel otherwise wasted when idling or driving at low speeds.

TLU-10. Promote the Use of Alternative Transportation Fuels

Policy Description
Increasing use of alternative transportation fuels has the potential to result in savings of imported
petroleum-based fuels, and also reduce GHG emissions. State and local governments have the
potential to “lead by example” by increasing use of alternative transportation fuels in fleet
vehicles.
Alternative-Fuel Production Incentives
Adopt standards that require a certain amount or percentage of fuel sold within the state to be a
low-carbon fuel (e.g., ethanol or biodiesel). This percentage can gradually increase over time.
The state can help facilitate transition to low-carbon fuels by regulating quality standards for fuel
blends. This recommendation could also promote research and development related to biofuel
production, such as the use of enzymes for breaking down cellulose to produce ethanol (as
opposed to corn-based ethanol, which has a lower life-cycle benefit).
Targeted State Fuel Procurement to Encourage Alternative Fuel Production
This might require minimum volumes of cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel to be blended into
gasoline and diesel fuel commensurate with specified in-state production of these biofuels. This
would be designed to ensure that biofuel produced will be blended and sold in the state—
ensuring a market for biofuel producers.
Alternative-Fuel Infrastructure Development
Directly or indirectly provide incentives to private providers of alternative-fuel infrastructure.
The development of an alternative-fuel infrastructure can aid in the promotion of alternative-fuel
use and offset the expense of equipment and installation costs. The convenient locations of
stations offering alternative fuels at competitive prices can increase the use of the fuels. In
addition, it is important to increase the availability, accessibility, and use of alternative fuels and
low-sulfur diesel for off-road vehicles. Expand low-carbon fuel use to off-road and recreational
marine vehicles. Provide incentives and support for low-carbon fuel infrastructure development.
Policy Design
Goals: Consistent with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) promulgated in the federal Energy
Information and Security Act (EISA), Kentucky’s share of the RFS2 requirement is projected to
be 335 million gallons of advanced biofuels, based upon Kentucky’s 1.6% share of the nation’s
motor fuel use in 2022. The goal of 20% of Kentucky’s motor fuels demand may be met in 2030
from Kentucky feedstocks, while continuing to produce safe, abundant, and affordable food,
feed, and fiber. Additional biofuels estimated to be produced in AFW-4 beyond the level of instate consumption would be expected to be exported for out-of-state consumption.

H-71

Timing: Current levels are approximately 6%, primarily from E-10 and B-2. Assume growth as
B-10 and E-85 use increases. 46 Additional increases can be achieved by incorporating plug-in
hybrid vehicles and compressed natural gas. Technology and research advances will also
increase the use and availability of alternative fuels.
Parties Involved: Meeting these goals would benefit citizens of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky by generating new jobs and reducing net per capita carbon emissions, while ensuring
Kentucky’s economic viability and assisting Kentucky in gaining energy independence from
imported oil. Parties involved in implementation include the General Assembly and state
agencies, including departments in KEEC, KYTC, KDA Facilities Services, Fleet Management,
and the FAC. Any state agencies with sizable fleets, such as elementary and secondary schools,
colleges and universities, and the KPS, should also be involved. Affected parties who are also
involved in implementation include private industry developers, commercial and retail
distributors, post-secondary institutions, agriculture producers, low-carbon fuel producers, and
technology innovators.
Other: The current largest deterrent for achieving this goal beyond current economic conditions
is the limited availability of alternative fuel products for consistent consumption.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Develop purchasing criteria for the Commonwealth to increase the overall fuel efficiency of
the vehicles in the state fleet.

•

The General Assembly should enact a tax credit of the income tax and the limited liability
entity tax owed by a company installing or locating blender pumps in an amount equal to no
greater than 50% of the capital expenditure costs of the required equipment. This type of
incentive will exponentially increase the availability of alternative fuels.

•

The Commonwealth will establish an escalating renewable fuel standard (RFS) for the state
vehicle fleet. The state will establish an initial RFS of 10%, or 560,000 gallons (10% of an
estimated 5.6 million gallons consumed annually by all state fleet vehicles) for E-10 gasoline.

•

The state will require all eligible fueling stations under government contract to provide, at a
minimum, E-10 gasoline and B-2 biodiesel by 2012.

Quantification Methods: The policy analyzed is a scenario consistent with a goal level for
biofuel consumption that may be summarized as a 20% biofuels share by 2030 (“20-by-‘30”)
goal. To achieve this goal, the policy seeks to utilize a combination of incentives for increased
production of biofuels from in-state feedstock sources and for expansion of biofuel
infrastructure. Biofuel usage is expected to rise significantly, even in the absence of any policy.
Kentucky’s 20%-by-2030 goal is best understood in light of how it differs from those
projections. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) official baseline projections indicate that biofuel
consumption is expected to reach more than 10% of total fuel demand in 2025. Further, by 2030,
biofuel consumption is expected to exceed the 12% share stated by Kentucky’s goal. Table TLU10-2 shows the projected growth of the role of biofuels as an energy source for LDVs under the
baseline scenario, and the 20-by-‘30 scenario. Figure TLU-10-1 shows the baseline and scenario
trends for the 20-by-‘30 scenario.

Figure TLU-10-1. Biofuels Share of Fuel Supply under 20%-by-2030 Scenario

The baseline scenario, or “business as usual” scenario, shows a significant growth in biofuel use.
Biofuels, which currently represent only about 6% of the volume of fuel consumed by on-road
vehicles, are projected to represent over 12% of the volume by 2030, even without any statelevel policy intervention. This increase results from projections that show that the U.S.
transportation sector will make significant strides toward meeting the goals of the federal RFS
established in 2007, which calls for the national fleet to utilize 36 million gallons of biofuels by
2022. Because the baseline itself contains significant growth in consumption of biofuels, the

H-74

20% by 2030 goal has a significant effect, as Figure TLU-10-1, above, shows. Under the
scenario recommended, biofuel use would grow by 60% above the baseline in 2025, and by
almost 80% above the baseline in 2030.
The quantification method for this analysis relies on the VISION model, which is a
transportation energy and emissions model developed and updated every year by DOE’s ANL.
The VISION model is built around a detailed perpetual-inventory model of the national vehicle
fleet. A great deal of detail can be customized in this tool with regard to fleet size and makeup,
driver behavior, fuels characteristics and levels of use, and emission factors.
For these analyses, the VISION model is first adjusted to represent only Kentucky’s share of fuel
use and VMT, using FHWA historical data and the officially accepted Kentucky KCAPC
baseline inventory and forecast. The VISION model is then manipulated to analyze scenarios for
different policies’ goal levels, by adjusting volumes of E-85 and B-10 consumption, overall
ethanol and biodiesel consumption, and rates of biofuel blend purchases by drivers with
compatible vehicles (flex-fuel vehicles).
The TLU-10 policy is not expected to have a significant impact on prices of biofuels, though
some impact is possible. The total projection for U.S. biofuel consumption for 2011–2030 is
projected to exceed 450 billion gallons (according to DOE estimates). In the absence of actions
by other states or the federal government, this strategy would increase national biofuel use by
approximately 2% of the expected use over that time. Taking into account analyses suggesting
that ethanol prices can be sensitive to changes in supply and demand, the price change due to a
shift in consumption of this scale would be, at most, a few cents per gallon. The effects on
gasoline prices, which are based on a much larger volume of consumption, are not likely to be
noticeable.
Key Uncertainties
Prices of fuels, both petroleum-based and biomass-based, are unreliable even over periods of two
to three years. Projections 20 years out should not be taken as reliable. The costs, and costeffectiveness, of this strategy turn on the relative prices of biofuels and petroleum fuels, and the
biggest impacts occur after 2020. If petroleum prices rise above biofuel prices, this strategy will
be much more cost-effective; if they fall below biofuel prices, however, this policy will impose
significant direct costs on consumers.
Additional Benefits and Costs
None noted.
Feasibility Issues
Much of the increased use of alternative transportation fuels will depend on both state and
federal regulations. Reinstating the federal biodiesel incentive will help ensure the continued
viability of the biodiesel industry. The state can help facilitate transition to low-carbon fuels by
regulating quality standards for fuel blends. Targeted state fuel procurement might require
minimum volumes of cellulosic ethanol and biodiesel to be blended into gasoline and diesel fuel
commensurate with specified in-state production of these biofuels. Directly or indirectly

TLU-11. Promote the Use of Clean Vehicles

Policy Description
Increasing use of cleaner vehicles has the potential to result in savings of imported petroleumbased fuels, and also reduce GHG emissions. State and local governments have the potential to
“lead by example” by increasing use of alternative transportation fuels in fleet vehicles.
By promoting the use of clean vehicles, this policy is designed to reduce Kentucky’s energy
demands, as well as GHG emissions from the transportation sector. Clean vehicles reduce GHG
emissions through fuel efficiency, advanced vehicle technologies, and/or use of low-carbon
fuels. The use of clean vehicles should be promoted through incentives and education. These
vehicles include plug-in hybrids, natural gas vehicles, high-efficiency vehicles, hybrid-electric
vehicles, electric vehicles, clean diesel vehicles, and clean diesel hybrid vehicles. Diesel vehicles
have excellent fuel economy, and when paired with up-to-date pollution reduction devices either
by retrofitting older vehicles or as required for new models (collectively referred to as “clean
diesel” technologies), they can be an effective means to reduce GHGs.
Policy Design
To meet a goal for fuel efficiency improvement, the current baseline fuel economy must be
identified. This information would need to be compiled by a state agency charged with
implementing this policy. Once a baseline for Kentucky’s fuel economy is established, the state
could then establish goals for improving the fuel economy of the entire fleet as a basis for
reducing GHG emissions.
In setting this goal, it is important to account for emission reductions that will occur as a result of
national regulations. Recently, EPA and DOT’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
finalized new corporate average fuel economy (CAFÉ) standards for model year 2012 through
2016 LDVs. In total, the new CAFE standards will reduce GHG emissions from the U.S. lightduty fleet by approximately 21% by 2030 over the level that would occur in the absence of new
standards.
Diesel fuel and engine standards have also been strengthened in recent years. In January 2001
and June 2004, EPA finalized the Highway Diesel and Non-road Diesel Rules, respectively,
which set more stringent standards for new diesel engines and fuels. The rules mandated the use
of lower-sulfur fuels in diesel engines (ULSD), which enabled the use of after-treatment
technologies, such as diesel particulate filters on new and retrofitted diesel engines that can
reduce harmful emissions by 90% or more. This includes reductions of diesel particulate matter,
comprised largely of black carbon, a potential GHG.
After-treatment technologies control emissions by removing pollutants from vehicle exhaust
(i.e., filters) or converting those pollutants into less harmful components (i.e., catalysts). These
technologies can be retrofitted onto older engines, and requirements have already begun being
phased into new diesel vehicles and equipment, beginning in 2007 for highway and 2011 for
non-road vehicles and equipment.

H-77

On average, diesel vehicles have longer useful lives than gasoline vehicles. Consequently, the inuse fleet will take much longer to turn over than the in-use LDV (gasoline) fleet. However, with
the use of cleaner diesel fuel, there are retrofit technologies available for most applications.
These retrofits reduce emissions of air pollutants, allowing for the fuel efficiency benefits of
diesel engines with fewer negative impacts on air quality than older, dirtier diesel engines. In
fact, “when ULSD fuel and diesel particulate filters are used, light duty diesel vehicles have a 17
percent CO2equivalent emissions benefit over gasoline powered vehicles.” 47
Goals
•

By 2025, increase the average fuel efficiency of Kentucky’s new-vehicle fleet by 12%–25%
over and above the projected fuel efficiencies of the federal 2016 CAFE standards. This
improvement in fuel efficiency would be achieved by implementing a policy that would
result in an increased number of fuel-efficient vehicles being placed into operation in
Kentucky that is above the number projected to occur under the federal accelerated CAFE
standards alone. This would be achieved through monetary incentives, such as tax credits,
feebates, or reduced registration fees, with the eligibility requirements for vehicle purchasers
to receive the incentive determining the ultimate impact on new-vehicle fleet efficiency.

•

By 2015, improve the state-owned vehicle fleet fuel economy by 30%, to 21.7 mpg, as
compared to a 2007 baseline of 16.7 mpg.

•

By 2025, improve the state-owned vehicle fleet fuel economy by 50%, to 25 mpg, as
compared to the 2007 baseline of 16.7 mpg.

•

By 2025, increase the number of clean diesel vehicles registered in Kentucky (either new or
retrofitted) by 50%.

Timing: The timing for implementing these goals should align with Kentucky’s overall energy
plan and GHG reduction targets.
Parties Involved: The KEEC Department for Energy Development and Independence (DEDI),
KYTC Division of Motor Vehicle Licensing, FAC, Kentucky Department of Revenue, county
clerks, automobile dealer associations, automobile manufacturers.
Other: The design and implementation of measures intended to achieve this policy goal should
be spearheaded by DEDI, but will need to be administered in partnership with state and local
agencies.
Implementation Mechanisms
The proposed policies and programs in this policy recommendation will need to be passed
through the legislative process and implemented by state and local government agencies in
partnership with affected parties. These policies will need to be evaluated by DEDI for feasibility
and effectiveness in Kentucky, as well as the impact on revenue streams supporting other state
programs. Following is a list of possible mechanisms to encourage the purchase of clean vehicles
and achieve the goals set for this policy recommendation.

•

Outreach and Education—Raising awareness of the importance of fuel efficiency and lowGHG fuels, to both the environment and the consumer’s pocketbook, can encourage the
purchase of these vehicles. Along with the awareness, access to information about vehicle
fuel economy and consumer benefits of higher fuel economy should be readily available.

•

Feebates—Feebates are a market-based alternative in which vehicles with fuel consumption
rates above a “pivot point” are charged fees, while vehicles below receive rebates.

•

Tax Credits for Low-GHG Vehicles—A tax credit program has been implemented at the
federal level. The results of this program should be studied for effectiveness and impact on
the state revenue stream.

•

Operating Incentives for Low-GHG Vehicles—This could include access to preferred or
reduced-rate parking, HOV lane access, and other benefits on state or local governmentowned or -controlled properties.

•

Vehicle Registration Fees—This may be similar to a feebate system, but rather than provide
a rebate for low-GHG cars, low-emitting vehicles would simply pay a lower registration fee
than high-emitting vehicles.

•

Grant Programs (Likely for Fleets)—These types of programs provide a financial incentive
to retrofit, repower, or replace equipment by covering the cost of the new technology.

This analysis examines the GHG reductions possible under a series of strategies pursuing a
significantly more efficient statewide vehicle fleet by 2025, as well as a much more efficient
state-owned LDV fleet. The targets are a statewide fleet that is 12%–25% more efficient than
required under recent federal CAFE standard legislation and regulations, and a government fleet
that achieves 30% greater efficiency by 2015 and 50% greater efficiency by 2025. The selected
policy approach to achieving these goals is the application of financial incentives and
disincentives, such as fees and rebates assessed at vehicle purchase, differential registration fee
rates, and other financial incentive mechanisms. The approach to modeling the impacts of
financial incentives is literature-based, relying primarily on targeted incentives research by
Greene et al. 48 and Davis et al. 49 working out of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and DOE’s
Office of Policy, respectively.
Review of this research identified fee and incentive scenarios that would achieve a fuelefficiency improvement in new vehicles of 17% over the 14-year range of 2011–2025, or almost
exactly in the middle of the 12%–25% range described in the TLU POD.
The quantification method for this analysis relies on the VISION model, which is a
transportation energy and emissions model developed and updated every year by experts at ANL.
The VISION model is built around a detailed perpetual-inventory model of the national vehicle
fleet. A great deal of detail can be customized in this tool with regard to fleet size and makeup,
driver behavior, fuels characteristics and levels of use, and emission factors.
This model is first adjusted to represent only Kentucky’s share of fuel use and VMT using
FHWA historical data. Alternate prices representing the impacts of the relevant fees and rebates
on the price facing the consumer of new vehicles are then used to modify the model, and
alternate projections for fuel efficiency are introduced to represent the impact of both changes in
consumer choice and changes by manufacturers to vehicles to take advantage of the policy.

CCI-1. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emission Inventories,
Forecasts, Reporting, and Registry

Policy Description
Inventories inform state leaders and the public on statewide trends, opportunities for mitigating
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or enhancing sinks, and verifying GHG reductions associated
with implementation of all future regulatory and reporting requirements. GHG emission
inventories are a critical component of all GHG policy development. This should also be the case
in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
Emission inventories serve as a regulatory platform by establishing a baseline rate of annual
GHG emissions. A comprehensive GHG inventory of all direct emission sources within the
borders of the Commonwealth, both point and fugitive sources, should be developed and updated
annually. 1 An effective inventory is comprised of specific components:
•

This GHG inventory should serve as the official GHG emissions inventory of anthropogenic
sources and sinks within the borders of the Commonwealth.

•

The inventories should be transparent and consistent with the GHG inventory reporting
guidelines and requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 2

•

GHG emission factors should be consistent with national and international guidance
documents.

•

Threshold reporting levels should be determined by the Commonwealth to adequately and
accurately compile a comprehensive inventory of GHG emission sources and sinks.

•

State emission inventories should serve as a compilation tool for organizing city and county
GHG emission inventory efforts.

•

Emission inventories should be verified by certified independent third-party verifiers.

•

Direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2) should be included in the GHG
emissions inventory. Emission sinks and carbon sequestration credits should only occur
within the physical boundaries of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

•

GHG emission projections should be transparent, and all assumptions should be clearly
disclosed.

•

The inventory will include six GHGs—carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide
(N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)—and
will weight these gases according to global warming potentials reported by EPA.

1

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has demonstrated the importance of GHG inventory reporting
as a precursor to policy making with the General Provisions of 40 CFR Part 98. The Final Rule requires affected
source categories to begin tracking GHG emissions on January 1, 2010, and report annual emissions for calendar
year 2010 by April 2011.

See: http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/reporting_requirements/items/2759.php.

I-2

Policy Design
The comprehensive GHG emissions inventory will serve as a foundation for developing emission
projections and all future GHG emission regulatory requirements. An effective inventory system
is aligned with national protocols and tailored to specific sources and sinks found in Kentucky.
Two essential mechanisms of an inventory are reporting and registry functions.
Reporting
GHG reporting reflects the measurement and reporting of GHG emissions to support goal
development, tracking of GHG emissions, and efficient management of resources. GHG
reporting can help sources identify GHG emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks, and
potentially develop revenue associated with future GHG mandates by developing the required
infrastructure in advance. GHG reporting is a precursor for sources to participate in GHG
reduction programs, opportunities for recognition, and a GHG emission reduction registry, as
well as to secure “baseline protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions).
Registry
A GHG registry enables recording of GHG emission reductions in a central repository with
“transaction ledger” capacity to support tracking, management, and “ownership” of emission
reductions; establish baseline protection; enable recognition of environmental leadership; and/or
provide a mechanism for regional, multistate, and cross-border cooperation. Properly designed
registry structures also provide a foundation for possible future trading programs. The reporting
protocol and format must be aligned with the requirements of the registry provider.
Goals
•

Gather all inventory-related information for calendar years (CY) 2005 and 2010; 2010 will
serve as the inventory base, with 2005 being used to develop trends. For 2011 and beyond, a
GHG emissions inventory should be compiled by the Commonwealth on a biennial basis.
These biennial inventories should be compiled in a biennial report that shows trends and
includes recommendations for improvements.

•

Coordinate with federal agencies to ensure consistency in GHG reporting rules. Follow the
U.S. EPA’s requirements for stationary sources as they relate to GHG emissions.

•

Strive to avoid duplication of reporting requirements on GHG emission sources. Rely on the
use of data that GHG emission sources already report under existing and future state and
federal programs to avoid duplication of reporting burden on the sources. Utilize existing air
pollution reporting systems and processes where applicable. Utilize existing government
structures to identify an appropriate home for this work.

•

Facilitate and encourage voluntary participation in an approved registry program.

•

Encourage cross-departmental collaboration at the local and state levels.

•

Educate and engage key private and public stakeholders in understanding the benefits of
GHG emission measurement and stabilization.

•

Develop a forecasting protocol based on CY 2010. Generate projections of future GHG
emissions in 5-year increments extending to 2050.

2010 will serve as the inventory base, with 2005 being used to develop trends. For 2011 and
beyond, a GHG emissions inventory should be compiled by the Commonwealth biennially.
These inventories should be compiled in a biennial report that shows trends and includes
recommendations for improvements.

CCI-2. Public Education and Outreach

Policy Description
The Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) recognizes the importance of public
involvement and education regarding the issues of climate change to enhance communication
and dialogue about climate issues. An essential element of addressing climate change for
Kentucky is education and outreach. An effective process must be developed that increases
understanding and awareness of the issue and the potential impact of climate change on the
economy, environment, and lifestyle of present and future generations of Kentuckians. This
process must involve a broad range of stakeholders and interest groups in implementing
strategies to address climate change. The outreach and education component will target six
specific groups of stakeholders. The process should be initiated early in the planning stages and
should continue through the development and implementation of a Climate Action Plan.
The purpose of an education and outreach policy is to raise understanding of the technical and
policy issues surrounding climate change, open lines of communication with stakeholders, and
involve those stakeholders in the implementation process. Each identified group may have a
different level of understanding of and stake in the impact(s) of climate change and may be
affected differently by strategies to address climate change. Effective environmental education
involves listening to multiple perspectives, sharing information, and addressing concerns through
proactive community engagement.
Public outreach and environmental education can be used to help identify the main concerns of a
host community, as well as the perceived benefits of an action plan. This process will help the
KCAPC to address the issues of relevance to a particular community. The involvement through
outreach and education of these groups will assist in developing lasting commitments to
improving Kentucky’s environment and economy through methods that minimize negative
impacts and enhance positive outcomes. An additional goal of this policy is to facilitate funding
for climate change and carbon mitigation research, and ensure the results of this research are
used when developing new policies and regulations. Funding will target research in Kentucky
that focuses on these main areas: climate science; energy efficiency enhancement; development
and implementation of low-carbon technologies for industrial, residential, and transportation
sectors; carbon capture technology; and carbon storage technology. Outreach and technology
transfer will be an important part of this research, to help inform, educate, and engage the public.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of the public education and outreach policy recommendation are to increase
awareness of the issues and understanding of the costs of and benefits from adopting new
policies and/or goals for current and future generations, to involve stakeholders in ongoing
dialogue, and to effect behavioral change in a way that minimizes the negative impacts of
climate change. Education of Kentucky’s citizens, business leaders, and policymakers is integral
to the successful implementation of behavioral and infrastructural changes necessary to minimize
potential negative effects of climate change on the state's environment, economy, and lifestyle.
The components of this policy should build upon and be linked to the activities, programs, and
I-6

funding currently in place in the state. The four major elements of the education and outreach
component are:
•

Improve communication and dialogue about climate change.

•

Provide education about climate and climate change.

•

Involve multiple stakeholders in the process, and understand their concerns and awareness of
climate change.

•

Facilitate research funding opportunities within Kentucky, and leverage federal funding in
the areas of climate science and carbon capture and storage technologies, energy efficiency,
and diversification of energy sources. Communicate research results to the public,
policymakers, legislators, stakeholders, and interest groups.

The steps of the public education and outreach policy are:
1. Appoint a Public Education and Outreach Team. The team would be selected by the KEEC
Secretary or his or her designee. Individuals with experience in environmental education,
communications, and technical fields (energy production, conservation, and management;
climate science; or environmental sciences) are preferred. The team should have a broad
representation of these fields from state agencies and public/private and
educational/industrial/environmental interests, and would develop a plan for public education
and outreach to the stakeholder groups. A KEEC representative will be designated as a
member and staff coordinator for the team.
2. Identify key stakeholders and develop balanced outreach messages related to the Climate
Action Plan and associated policies. The Public Education and Outreach Team should first
establish a baseline of public understanding of the impacts of climate change and variability
of proposed state-specific actions to deal with climate change. Second, the group should
identify key messages for each party involved, by conducting a series of public forums and
interviews.
3. Develop outreach materials based on identified outreach messages for specific stakeholders.
Transfer information to the stakeholders, and allow for feedback. While the goal of the group
should be education-based—that is, showing all sides of the issue and teaching how to think
critically about this issue, rather than telling people what to think about the issue—it may
also be necessary for the group to identify and utilize social marketing techniques to
encourage energy conservation and a lower-energy lifestyle.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of the materials through implementation of the Climate Action
Plan, and monitor levels of understanding and changes in public perception and concerns.
Refine the materials based on the evaluation.
Timing
•

Year 1, first 6 months:

will be needed regarding key understandings related to climate change and strategies for GHG
emission reduction, energy intensity, and energy efficiency activities. The key activities needed
to engage the agencies include, but are not limited to, the following:
•

Initial assessment. Assess the level of understanding of the impacts of climate change and
state-specific actions to deal with climate change.

•

Message. Encourage agency actions and leadership in energy efficiency and intensity in state
government agencies.

•

Methods. Create posters and other outreach materials for distribution to state agencies.
Develop optional brown-bag discussion courses about the issue, with a take-home reading
component for state employees, perhaps requiring participation for leaders of these agencies.
Establish model greening language for adoption in agency policies. Strive to reduce and/or
eliminate barriers to green purchasing in state government.
I-8

•

Incentives and recognition. Establish a recurring awards program to recognize leadership
and attainment of the goals and objectives of the Kentucky Climate Action Plan.

Local and State Policymakers
Education and outreach efforts with state and local elected officials will provide education about
issues surrounding climate change and implications for public officials.
•

Partner with the Department of Local Government, the Kentucky Association of Counties,
and the Kentucky League of Cities through existing forums and outreach materials to spread
the message.

•

Utilize the county officials training program in the Department of Local Government.

state, and federal actions on their areas (state or local government).

•

Identify key officials who should be involved initially.

•

Assist with developing new materials and training to inform local and state officials.

•

Include sharing of climate strategies and implementation as part of interactions with Sister
Cities programs.

Future Generations
Materials will be developed and existing materials and forums will be used to inform primary,
secondary, and post-secondary students and teachers about key understandings related to climate
change, and efforts to address climate change in public policy. Curriculum will be developed
with input from educators and correlated to the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE) Core
Content, and the KDE Program of Studies. Focus will be first on core climate concepts, such as
how carbon cycles through Earth’s systems, the difference between weather and climate, sources
and sinks of carbon and other GHGs, what GHGs are and how they relate to the greenhouse
effect, etc.
The second half of the curriculum should focus on sustainability and steps that students and
schools can take to minimize impacts through reducing consumption and promotion of a lowcarbon lifestyle. Methods and programs for developing implementation of these “best practices”
and principles in schools will be identified and utilized, and any additionally necessary programs
will be developed as needed. These best practices will need to be integrated into public school
design and construction, and used as a means to educate students (and parents) and the general
public firsthand in their communities and colleges.
•

Initial assessment. Assess the level of understanding of the concept of climate change and
key understandings related to that concept. Assess the level of understanding of the impacts
of climate change.

•

Message. Communicate core climate and climate change concepts and personal and districtlevel actions that can help reduce the carbon footprints of individuals and school districts.

Groups involved in advocacy from all viewpoints (environmental, groups supporting coal
mining, or business and industrial interests) will be targeted through focus groups and
educational materials. The purpose and focus will be to provide information on core climate
concepts, including sources and sinks of carbon and other GHGs, what GHGs are and how they
relate to the greenhouse effect, reducing energy use, controlling carbon emissions, and enhancing
Kentucky’s use of energy efficiency systems. Along with providing education, conducting focus
groups with these groups will allow better understanding of their concerns and viewpoints.
Climate Change and Solution Research Funding Panel
Designate a Climate Change and Solution Research Funding Panel that will facilitate technical,
business, and social research funding in Kentucky universities and industry. This panel will:
•

Coordinate research on climate science, energy efficiency enhancement, development and
implementation of low-carbon technologies for industrial, residential, and transportation
sectors, carbon capture technology, and carbon storage technology by establishing a database
of pertinent research projects in Kentucky. This database will be made available on the Web
so other researchers and the general public can keep informed on research topics, progress,
and final results.

•

Work with KEEC to identify important research areas and obtain state funding for projects.

•

Identify state and federal funding opportunities, and communicate to researchers who may
want to respond to specific solicitations. Coordinate state matching funds to leverage federal
funds.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
KDE and the KEEC are essential partners in developing education and outreach materials and
processes.
Kentucky NEED is the state affiliate of the National Energy Education Development (NEED)
Project, a nonprofit education association, dedicated since 1980, to equipping students and
teachers with a realistic understanding of the scientific, economic, and environmental impacts of
energy. Kentucky NEED provides core content-aligned curriculum for students, professional
development for teachers, energy management programs for school operations and maintenance
staff, and professional development and workshops for teachers.
Project Lead the Way (PLTW) is a program that works with middle schools and high schools and
involves partnering schools and industry to prepare an increasing and more diverse group of
students for success in engineering and engineering technology programs. PLTW focuses on
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In the engineering curriculum, students
investigate the importance of energy in our lives and the impact of energy use on the
environment. Students design and model alternative energy sources and participate in an energy
expo to demonstrate energy concepts and innovative ideas. They also evaluate ways to reduce
energy consumption through energy efficiency and waste management techniques.

I-12

Green Bank of Kentucky is part of the Kentucky Finance Cabinet. It promotes energy efficiency
in state buildings through competition for low-interest loans to reduce operating costs and energy
use, protect the environment, save taxpayer dollars, promote economic development, and create
new “green collar” jobs by means of education, engineering analyses, and building
improvements. Green Bank of Kentucky is active in public outreach efforts and is an essential
part of a comprehensive outreach and education process.
In the Kentucky Green and Healthy Schools program, students implement projects to improve
the health, safety, or sustainability of their schools in nine different categories: Energy, Green
Spaces, Hazardous Chemicals, Health & Safety, Indoor Air Quality, Instructional Leadership,
Solid Waste, Transportation, and Water Quality. These efforts provide a forum for increasing
environmental literacy and raising awareness of climate issues.
Through the Safe Routes to Schools program, students learn the value of exercise by walking or
riding their bicycle to school. The program could be used as a forum for discussing the additional
benefit of walking and riding instead of driving vehicles, including reduced vehicle exhaust and
improved air quality.
KDE’s Regional Resource Centers (RRCs) also provide educational assistance. The RRC
Program assists state education agencies in the systemic improvement of education programs,
practices, and policies that affect children and youth with disabilities. By working across regions,
RRCs facilitate networking and information sharing among states and U.S. jurisdictions.

CCI-3. Adaptation and Vulnerability

Policy Description
The Commonwealth of Kentucky should undertake a comprehensive planning effort to assess the
state’s vulnerability to the physical impacts of climate change on the natural environment and
human health, and then to identify and evaluate adaptation opportunities. Various organizations
and agencies in the state are already collecting some of the information needed to make such an
assessment, and efforts should be made to coordinate and consolidate these informationgathering activities.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Undertake a comprehensive planning effort to assess the impact of climate change on
Kentucky, including, but not limited to, impacts on water quality and quantity, agriculture,
recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, industry, and human health. The analysis, to the extent
possible, will include the economic impacts on these sectors.

•

Suggest adaptation strategies to minimize the effects of climate change on the above sectors
within the Commonwealth.

Timing: As part of the Kentucky Climate Action Plan, KEEC should begin to coordinate
collection of existing information and identification of data gaps in 2010, and continue in 2011.
Assessment of the state’s vulnerability to climate change impacts in the above sectors will begin
in 2011.
Parties Involved: Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection (DEP), Department for
Energy Development and Independence (DEDI), Department for Natural Resources (DNR);
Kentucky Fish and Wildlife; Kentucky Water Resources Research Institute; Kentucky

CCI-4. Statewide GHG Emission Reduction, Energy Intensity, and Energy
Efficiency Goals, Targets, and Metrics

Policy Description
Kentucky is the third-largest coal producer in the United States and has an electricity generation
fleet that is more than 90% coal-fired. Approximately 49% of that power is delivered to an
industrial sector that produces automobiles, appliances, aluminum, stainless steel, chemicals, and
other products. With its high reliance on coal to meet its electric energy needs, Kentucky may be
subject to disproportionally large economic and infrastructure impacts as a result of federal
action to limit GHG emissions, relative to states with more options available to them (see CCI8). Simultaneously, Kentucky is also a developing economy, depending heavily on
manufacturing and production for a significant majority of gross state product (GSP). Therefore,
any implementation plan must be Kentucky-specific.
In November 2008 Governor Steven Beshear’s office published Intelligent Energy Choices for
Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy Independence. 3 The Kentucky
Energy Strategy includes outcome-based goals that are anticipated to result from implementation
of the seven strategies. They are described in the Policy Design section, below.
Policy Design
Goals: The following GHG emission reduction goals are from the 7-Point Energy Strategy were
used as a starting point for the analysis of potential statewide GHG emission reduction goals for
the Kentucky Climate Action Plan being developed by the KCAPC.
•

“GHG emissions will be more than 50% lower in 2025 than they would otherwise be.”

•

“GHG emissions in Kentucky will be 20% lower in 2025 than were our 1990 emissions.” 4

After analysis of the above GHG reduction goals from the 7-Point Energy Plan, it became
evident that significant reductions would result from implementation of several options in the
latter part of the planning period between 2025 and 2030. Therefore, the following GHG
reduction goal is recommended for Kentucky: Reduce GHG emissions in Kentucky to 20%
below 1990 levels by 2030.
In addition to formulating proposed GHG emission reduction goals as part of the KCAPC
process, the Council has indicated an interest in metrics for energy intensity and energy
efficiency. Therefore, three elements are proposed in this policy:
•

GHG Emission Reductions— Reduce GHG emissions in Kentucky to 20% below 1990 levels
by 2030.

3

Governor Steven Beshear, Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for
Energy Independence, page v, November 2008.

Ibid.

I-17

•

Energy Intensity—Development of a metric and possibly standards or goals for evaluating
the energy intensity, or CO2 emissions, per unit of product or service provided (e.g., 1 metric
ton of CO2 per megawatt-hour (MWh) of power delivered, or 3 MWh used per $1 million of
product value). This is also sometimes called carbon intensity. These values are determined
by comparison to regional or national averages within the same sector and industry.

•

Energy Efficiency—Development of a metric and possibly standards or goals for GSP per
unit of power consumed (industrial), or less overall energy use per hour of operation (homes,
buildings, etc.). This is a means of maintaining current energy use, while reducing overall
emissions through improvements that allow more energy use or more GSP for the same
amount of fuel consumed in the process.

Timing: Initiate in 2011 and ramp up by 2015.
Parties Involved: KEEC, the Public Service Commission (PSC), and the Cabinet for Economic
Development (CED) will be primarily responsible for implementation of the goals. The
legislature, representative organizations from within each of the economic sectors, citizen
groups, regional and national partnerships, etc., must be consulted during this process.
Other: The goals and targets must be reviewed within each sector periodically, with standards or
targets adjusted accordingly as regional and national equivalencies change. For that reason,
implementation of this strategy will require a long-term commitment by the Commonwealth to
fund and enforce reporting, monitoring, and special tariff enactments.
Implementation Mechanisms
To implement this strategy, the following actions should be undertaken:
•

Establish a responsible entity for this activity. This may be enacted within an existing agency
or formulated as an independent commission overseeing existing agency activity.

•

Evaluate Kentucky’s key economic sectors, and determine baseline productivity within each
of those sectors with respect to GSP or productivity per unit of relevant GHG emissions.

•

Determine applicable regional or national emission profiles for equivalent sectors on the
same basis.

•

Develop an economic model to determine which of the three options (or combinations of
options) within this strategy will have the most significant positive benefit in terms of sector
GSP while meeting national GHG goals. Not all sectors may have the same options (e.g.,
manufacturing based on intensity and home energy use based on efficiency).

•

Create the institutional capacity for continued broad stakeholder involvement in the energy
intensity and energy efficiency metric- and goal-setting process. Include entities not currently
represented on the KCAPC, both geographically and economically, such as small and
medium-size manufacturing companies and local Chambers of Commerce.

•

Using a stakeholder process, develop a metric for measuring energy intensity and energy
efficiency. Propose specific energy intensity and efficiency targets (in terms of appropriate
units) for each sector.

I-18

•

The responsible entity will begin study of economic sectors once authorized (July 2011 or
thereafter), utilizing as many existing mechanisms as possible (such as CCI-1).

•

The responsible entity will begin negotiated goals or targets determination with appropriate
stakeholders (July 2012 or thereafter).

•

The responsible entity will propose goals or targets for each identified economic sector to the
Secretary of the KEEC prior to January 2014.

•

The responsible entity will report to the Secretary of the KEEC the progress of GHG
emission reductions, as well as the relevant energy efficiency and energy intensity goals, in
accordance with the implementation of the CCI-1 reporting requirements. The Secretary may
review and adjust goals or targets for each sector.

This strategy will intertwine with CCI-1 and CCI-8 across many areas. For this reason, the initial
determination of regulated sectors and regional and national equivalences will be of paramount
importance. Any GHG mitigation plan ultimately adopted by Kentucky should ensure the costeffective reduction of GHG emissions in a manner that maximizes public benefits; sustains and
improves Kentucky’s economy; mitigates adverse socioeconomic impacts; encourages
innovation in energy production technologies, energy efficiency, and sustainable energy
technologies; and avoids inequitable interstate and interregional impacts.

CCI-5. State and Local Government GHG Emission Reduction, Energy Intensity,
and Energy Efficiency Activities (Lead by Example)

Policy Description
To effectively reduce GHG emissions, improve energy intensity and energy efficiency results,
and enhance air quality throughout the state, the Commonwealth will lead by example and will
encourage and support local governmental entities to take similar actions. Kentucky has already
undertaken numerous initiatives to enhance energy efficiency in state buildings and in public
schools and will further build on these initiatives.
The state will adopt policies, goals, benchmarks, and reduction targets for energy efficiency and
intensity strategies for state-owned or state-operated buildings, facilities, and vehicle fleets. To
encourage broad adoption of and compliance with these new policies, the state will develop
incentives for agencies, offices, and organizations that meet or exceed these established state
benchmarks. To implement these new policies, the Governor should assign or create a multiagency governmental body represented by staff from the Governor’s Office and all three
branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial), to direct ongoing state climate
efforts, including coordination with local government activities. Additionally, all programs and
capital development funded through state bonding mechanisms should be required to meet these
new policies.
Kentucky’s adherence to its own policies, goals, and targets will inform and encourage local
governmental entities to adopt similar policies, goals, and targets by highlighting the financial,
social, and environmental benefits inherent in these policies. Development of the goals in this
policy will help make energy efficiency practices available and accessible to Kentucky’s cities
and smaller communities.
Policy Design
Goals
•

Implement legislative mandates with regard to state-owned and -operated buildings,
renovations, and transportation options.

•

Appoint and organize the multi-agency body by June 30, 2011.

•

By December 31, 2011, the agency will establish goals and targets to accomplish the
following:
o The Commonwealth will increase its use of alternative fuel in the state fleet. This effort
may include increased use of electric and hybrid cars and alternative fuels like biodiesel,
ethanol, and natural gas, preferably from in-state sources. These changes will be
implemented to the maximum extent possible throughout all branches of state
government.
o The Commonwealth will identify roadblocks to the development of alternative-fuel
stations or access to recharge points, and will implement a plan to increase the number
and accessibility of recharge and refueling stations for alternative fuels.
I-21

o The state will identify ways to design, encourage, and provide incentives for regional
interconnected energy systems (e.g., smart grid, building management systems, energy
mapping, energy data collection, customer utility demand management, decentralized
energy production, transmission line upgrades for intermittent power sources) needed to
improve state and local government energy use and encourage innovative approaches to
energy supply and use. While many of these initiatives are not within the state’s power,
the state can serve as abettor, facilitator, and the coordinator in ways no individual
community, organization, agency, or company can.
o All new building and renovation projects funded by state dollars and bonding will be
required to incorporate energy efficiency aspects in the design, construction, or
renovation. Where feasible, projects should strive to achieve Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) standards.
o All state building and renovation projects that include new or substantial revision to
heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) and building systems will utilize
commissioning to maximize energy-efficient operation.
o The state purchasing practices will include the use of energy-efficient products where
feasible, especially in areas of lighting, HVAC units, etc.
o Accomplish culture change within state agencies, including educational institutions at all
levels, to continually identify efficiency measures that can reduce energy use without
damage to the institution’s essential functions.
o As part of the culture change, promulgate and enforce a no-idling policy for state
vehicles, except in traffic or required for health or safety. The state has probably the
largest fleet in Kentucky; this is a great opportunity to lead by example.
•

The multi-agency body will issue challenges to local governmental entities to address their
energy use and attitudes in the same manner.

Timing: The multi-agency entity should be established by the Governor by the end of June 2011,
and will immediately begin to design and develop specific goals and targets for state
government. The goals and targets for state-owned and state-operated buildings will be more
aggressive than those for buildings owned and operated by private entities. These goals and
targets will be adopted no later than December 2012, and implementation will begin
immediately.
Parties Involved: The multi-agency entity will include representatives from each cabinet and a
representative from the Governor’s Office, the state court system, and the legislature.
Other: State government efforts to reduce GHG emissions and improve energy efficiency and
energy intensity will have direct ancillary benefits of improving air quality by reducing
corresponding emissions to the ambient air.

CCI-6. Local GHG Emission Reduction, Energy Intensity, and
Energy Efficiency Actions

Policy Description
Many communities across Kentucky are actively engaged in developing GHG emission
reduction strategies, are seeking energy savings through energy intensity and energy efficiency
initiatives, and are striving to achieve effective air quality improvements. These communities’
existing efforts will be encouraged and supported by the Commonwealth. Additional
communities interested in evaluating the vulnerabilities and opportunities posed by pending state
and federal legislative changes and by predicted climate change will be provided encouragement
and tools for developing a local plan of action.
To leverage these efforts, the state will develop a tool kit for local governments, institutions, and
individuals to assist in planning and implementing effective strategies. The tool kit will utilize
nationally recognized best practices (ICLEI–Local Governments for Sustainability, ENERGY
STAR, LEED, etc.) to provide assistance with GHG emission reduction, energy intensity, and
energy efficiency actions, and will collect “best lessons learned” by entities throughout the
Commonwealth. It is not the intent of the state to utilize this policy to mandate how local
governments or organizations should address this planning process. Rather, the state will be a
partner to local communities by supporting, assisting, and coordinating these efforts where
appropriate or beneficial.
The Commonwealth also recognizes that its communities need assistance with implementing
their plans. The state will establish a “help desk” to share information and resources with its
communities.
Policy Design
Goals: The state will make available to local communities the necessary tools for planning for
potential climate change and associated legislative changes. These tools will be designed to
include educational materials, coordination with state and other communities, facilitation of
planning sessions, and information about potential economic impacts and opportunities ahead.
Local government units, whether county, city, or otherwise, will have the opportunity to
participate in learning about and commenting on the state’s plan of action. This opportunity will
help local planners better coordinate with planning activities already underway and use and learn
from work already completed.
The state will establish a help desk to provide assistance to communities in preparing and
implementing plans through actions to reduce energy use, educate their communities, and lead in
efficiency, reduction, and intensity. This help desk can provide technical assistance with
questions like:
•

How do I get an energy audit done?

What materials are available to use for education and outreach to commercial and industrial
businesses and organizations in my community?

•

How can I get help with writing a bid specifications proposal for procuring energy-efficient
equipment?

•

How do I identify and apply for available grant funding to tackle our projects?

Timing: As the state, through its many initiatives developed under the Kentucky Climate Action
Plan, learns about and identifies processes or actions that are effective in increasing energy
efficiency, reducing GHG emissions, and addressing energy intensity, it will make those tools
available to local governments. This process will be ongoing and will begin with development of
the first climate action plan. The statewide process to develop consensus on targets and goals for
GHG reduction, energy efficiency, and energy intensity will serve as a means to communicate
the tools under development by the state, and most important, as a means to listen to the needs of
the local communities across the state to guide further development, both of helpful tools and of
the goals and targets themselves.
Parties Involved: This effort should be coordinated by the multi-agency body established by the
Governor to direct the state “lead by example” policy. Other participants will be representatives
of local governmental bodies and interested citizens engaged in local planning and
implementation actions.
Other: None identified.

CCI-7. Financial Policies

Policy Description
Recognizing that some policy decisions to reduce GHG emissions will have costs, Kentucky
must develop long-term funding to implement KCAPC-adopted actions. This will require that a
framework be established and funding sources be identified that will be available to public–
private partnerships focused on improving energy efficiency and intensity. To accomplish this
policy, Kentucky will formulate a financial and regulatory structure that promotes investments in
cost-effective initiatives to promote improvements in energy efficiency and intensity.
Policy Design
Goals: In order to secure financing required to implement KCAPC-adopted actions in the long
term, to ensure efficient allocation of limited resources, and to deploy efficiency, emission- and
intensity-reduction strategies at scales across the Commonwealth, Kentucky will strive to
achieve the following goals:
•

Establish a revolving loan program, initially funded by the legislature and supported by
receipt of low-interest payments, to fund required changes that improve energy efficiency
and intensity, potentially structured as a performance savings contract.

•

Identify and aggressively pursue available grants, loans, and other funding to provide capital
funding and operational assistance for changes within the public and private sectors in
adapting to climate change and related policy changes.

•

Provide for an economic analysis that identifies the least-cost and most effective alternative
to improve energy efficiency and energy intensity for each goal in the Climate Action Plan.

•

Develop a marketing plan to attract appropriate investment by existing companies and new
investors in Kentucky’s resources, taking into consideration the potential for increased
energy costs.

•

Identify streamlining actions that can be implemented for permitting new businesses or
adopting revised permits for existing businesses, in order to best address changes in policy,
law, and regulation.

•

Take advantage of existing programs as vehicles for funding (e.g., Kentucky Bluegrass Turns
Green, Green Bank of Kentucky).

Timing
•

The legislature should consider and adopt a revolving loan fund during the 2011 or 2012
session to be administered by the appropriate entity of state government, and should identify
the source and amount of funding to initiate and support the loan fund.

•

The state will immediately create a point of contact within each appropriate cabinet to
aggressively seek and pursue funding from sources outside the state. All state employees
charged with this goal will coordinate with each other to ensure efficient use of resources.

I-28

•

The KCAPC will include the requirement for the economic analysis in its Climate Action
Plan and will recommend the means for implementing this plan.

•

The Climate Action Plan will immediately be reviewed by CED, with appropriate assistance
from DEDI, and will develop a plan of action during 2011.

•

KEEC will develop a plan to streamline permitting processes likely to be impacted by
changes in policy, law, and regulation during 2011, and will then provide that proposed plan
to stakeholders throughout the Commonwealth for input and final plan development during
2011 or 2012.

Parties Involved: The appropriate entity of state government will be primarily responsible for
implementing the goals, and will seek the input of stakeholders in business, local government,
and the higher education community. The Kentucky Science & Technology Corporation will
play a vital implementation role in providing financing for economic development opportunities
related to the Climate Action Plan.
Other: The Attorney General and PSC may be involved in addressing regulatory barriers to
implementation of efficiency improvements and emission reduction projects.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Conduct an assessment of existing financing programs throughout the state, identifying
successful models and approaches, as well as assessing the needs of current programs.

•

Provide for an economic analysis that identifies the least-cost and most effective alternative
to improve energy efficiency, emission reductions, and energy intensity for each goal in the
Climate Action Plan for the purposes of guiding investment decisions.

•

Establish the requisite framework to establish financing vehicles, including a revolving loan
fund, a guarantee fund, and bond authorities where appropriate.

•

Coordinate with existing state agencies and public entities supporting relevant projects, and
pursue available federal and international assistance where possible.

•

Build upon the success of existing programs as vehicles for funding (e.g., Kentucky
Bluegrass Turns Green, Green Bank of Kentucky), and partner with established private and
nonprofit efforts already underway in this sector.

•

Develop a marketing plan to attract appropriate investment by existing companies and new
investors in Kentucky’s resources, taking into consideration the potential for increased
energy costs.

•

Develop clear partnerships with private business, local government, and community groups
to identify and attract economic development that will benefit from and contribute to
Kentucky’s resources.

•

Choose the most cost-effective alternative in making decisions about climate change
adaptation, considering investment and operating costs as well as potential savings from
improved energy efficiency and energy intensity.

I-29

•

Identify ways Kentucky can shorten regulatory time frames for new permitting or revised
permitting occasioned by changes in law and policy, in order to conserve both time and
money in making required changes, while continuing to provide appropriate protections of
Kentucky’s natural resources and the health of its citizens.

•

Identify regulatory hurdles to implementation of energy efficiency and energy intensity
improvements across all sectors from energy production, use, transportation, and
manufacturing.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

The Bluegrass Turns Green program established by HB 2 allows for both a public-sector
grant fund and a private-sector loan fund subject to specific stipulations identified by the
legislature. Lack of capital has prevented this program from making progress.

•

The Green Bank of Kentucky, initially capitalized through ARRA, provides financing to state
entities for the purpose of carrying out construction upgrades or retrofits intended to reduce
energy use and costs. The capital is then paid back through the realization of energy savings,
replenishing the fund. Following the expenditure of ARRA funding, tax-exempt bonds may
be issued to capitalize the program.

•

The Kentucky Science and Technology Corporation administers several existing funds,
including the Kentucky Enterprise Fund, Rural Innovation Fund, and New Energy Ventures,
that provide financing for projects throughout Commonwealth. Additionally, the Kentucky
Science and Engineering Foundation administers the Commercialization Fund Program.
These examples can serve as models for the development of economic development-oriented
funds to support projects in line with the Climate Action Plan.

CCI-8. Conduct an Impact Analysis of Federal GHG Constraints on Kentucky

Policy Description
Kentucky is the third-largest coal producer in the United States and has an electricity generation
fleet that is more than 90% coal-fired. Approximately 49% of that power is delivered to an
industrial sector that produces automobiles, appliances, aluminum, stainless steel, chemicals, and
other products. With its high reliance on coal to meet its electric energy needs, Kentucky may be
subject to disproportionally large economic and infrastructure impacts as a result of federal
action to limit GHG emissions, relative to states with more options available to them, or relative
to states with less industrial development. It is therefore imperative for Kentucky to make its
voice and the voice of similar states heard in the national dialogue, to have a thorough
understanding of its vulnerability, and to have in place an adaptation plan if and when such
legislation or regulation is adopted (see CCI-3). It is also critical that Kentucky analyze the
impacts of higher electricity rates upon its economy, beginning with the industrial sector (see
CCI-3). In addition to vulnerability analysis associated with federal action and increased
electricity costs, it is critical that Kentucky evaluate opportunities that may have a positive
impact upon its economy.
Federal legislation and regulations tend to assume that one size fits all, which is not the case for
Kentucky and several of its neighbors. Because the execution of policies designed to reduce
climate change affects regions of the country differently, and the availability and feasibility of
energy solutions vary between regions, the one-size-fits-all approach can result in inequitable
regional impacts. For this reason, collaborative regional and multistate reduction efforts offer
promising possibility for developing compliance strategies that provide for greater opportunities for
effective and sustainable successes. Kentucky and several of its neighboring states rely heavily on
coal for their current energy supply, and coal is a major part of their economies. Utilizing alternative
energy resources, clean coal technology, energy efficiency, and renewable resources through
blended energy portfolios can result in a more diverse energy economy with acceptable
economic costs.
Any regulatory framework on emissions must be constructed in a way that does not arbitrarily
punish a Kentucky manufacturer for GHG emissions if that manufacturer is producing a greater
amount of product for equal or lesser emission levels than equivalent activities elsewhere when
adjusted for the regional energy portfolio. To avoid this disparity, a normalization approach,
taking into account the amount of energy required and the value of the products produced, should
be implemented.
Kentucky should take the leadership role in forming a regional group or consortium with similar
states, to ensure regional interests are represented and protected while meeting the overarching
goal of reducing GHGs.

I-32

Policy Design
Goals
•

Have a clear understanding of the sources of GHGs, and analyze the potential effects of
federal climate change policy, including legislation and/or regulations affecting these
sources.

•

Work to form and develop partnerships with states with similar interests to attempt to
influence federal regulation or legislation, so as to maximize the opportunity to Kentucky and
to minimize the negative impacts.

•

Evaluate available alternatives and their costs for mitigating GHG emissions required by
various federal proposals, as well as the economic benefits associated with increased
efficiency or the development of energy resources in Kentucky. Such strategies would
propose to mitigate GHG emissions in various sectors, including energy supply, residential,
commercial, industrial, transportation, land use, agriculture, forestry, and waste management.

•

Develop estimates of the impact of federal GHG actions on Kentucky’s economy, initially by
focusing on the impact of increased electricity prices on the industrial sector.

•

Present and inform Kentucky’s government, business leaders, and the public about the results
of these analyses and adaptation plans.

Timing: The KCAPC effort will result in a suite of options for GHG mitigation, including
discussion of any limitations (technological or economic), and will provide an estimated cost per
ton mitigated. In addition, DEDI is building capacity to model the effects of diversification of
electricity generation on prices of electricity and on emission levels, as well as on economic
development within the Commonwealth. By June 2011, Kentucky will have an estimate of the
impact of increased electricity rates on the industrial sector.
Independently, Kentucky will take on a leadership role in the identification of partner states with
similar interests regarding federal GHG mitigation policies, and will work to develop
partnerships that protect the state’s interests. Initial contact and discussions among potential
partner states will be undertaken during fiscal year 2010–2011. DEDI will periodically report
progress and issues.
Parties Involved: DEDI, CED, PSC, the University of Kentucky, and other stakeholders
identified within the evaluation.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Kentucky will take a leadership role in developing a partnership with similar states to
evaluate both costs and opportunities and to attempt to influence regulations and legislation.
This effort will be carried out by the Governor’s Office and KEEC.

•

DEDI will evaluate research conducted by federal agencies and others on the impact of
mitigating GHG and other emissions.

Appendix J
Comments on the Draft Final Report from
KCAPC Members and Agency Staff
Talina Mathews, Kentucky Public Service Commission (10-6-11)
Anywhere that my name is in the final draft, it should refer to me with the notation of
“formerly…” so that it is clear that the work was done as a part of my role at DEDI/EEC.
John Voyles, LG&E and KY Energy LLC (10-14-11)
Thanks for the opportunity to comment on the draft report. As I stated at more than one of the
KCAPC meetings, this work served as a starting point for future conversations with
policymakers and will require continued evaluation prior to any implementation of the
recommendations in the report. Clearly, it should be noted this report is a “snapshot” in time and
would need to be further refined, challenged, verified and validated. While I provided votes on
the recommendations to accept most of the information in this effort and this report, those votes
did not represent endorsement of a plan, which should be implemented. This plan serves as a
document from which our policy makers can use in their future deliberations, should those
occur.
Below find my specific comments and suggestions on the draft report:
•

Page iii – please change the company name under Vic Staffieri to read “LG&E and KU
Energy, LLC” instead of E.ON U.S. (if you need to leave this as originally selected then I
suggest you say “formerly E.ON U.S.”

•

Page ExS2 – first bullet under Key Elements and Recommendations – Make the first
sentence read “The KCAPC took into account Governor Steven Beshear’s Intelligent Energy
Choices for Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy Independence in
proposing GHG reduction goals for Kentucky to achieve a 20% reduction of GHGs below
1990 levels by 2030….. “

•

Page ExS2 – add to the closing paragraph of the Key Elements and Recommendations
section the following sentences – “The data and costs presented in this report are based on
the information and assumptions available at the time of the analyses. Data at a future point
in time may produce different results and as such policy recommendations chosen for action
at a future date should be updated accordingly.”

•

Page ExS4 – add a sentence to the third bullet – “Those energy intensive industries provide
valuable goods and services to many states beyond the borders of Kentucky.”

•

Page ExS-8 – add the following words to begin the first sentence last paragraph - “Based on
the assumptions used in 2010, Table ExS-2 depicts…..”

•

Page ExS-9 – add a sentence at the end of the paragraph before Table ExS-3 – “For the
column labeled Level of Support, it is important to note Unanimous Approval applies only to
those KCAPC members present at the time of the approval vote.”

J-1

•

Page 1-2 – add the following to the end of the first sentence in the second bullet – “….below
1990 levels by 2030, consistent with Governor Steven Beshear’s Intelligent Energy Choices
for Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point Strategy for Energy Independence.”

•

Page 1-4 – in the next to last paragraph which describes the voting and begins with “The
KCAPC process employed…” – I suggest adding the following to the end of the paragraph –
“It is important to note that not all KCAPC members were available to attend all
meeting where voting was conducted, so the results reflect only votes from those present
at the meetings.”

•

Page 1-6 – section titled Estimates of Costs/Cost Savings – the third bullet is not a complete
sentence, so I don’t know what was intended to be written there.

•

Page 1-6 – section titled Estimates of Costs/Cost Savings – I believe the first paragraph needs
to have a qualifying sentence added – “The estimated costs used in the analyses of the
policy options were based on the assumptions and data from 2010 which should be
revisited if any future actions are considered for implementation.”

•

Page 1-8 – add the following to the last bullet, consistent with the comment above - “Those
energy intensive industries provide valuable goods and services to many states beyond the
borders of Kentucky.”

•

Page 1-10 – last bullet – add to the end of the first sentence – “(Consistent with Governor
Steven Beshear’s Intelligent Energy Choices for Kentucky’s Future, Kentucky’s 7-Point
Strategy for Energy Independence.)”

•

Pages 1-13 through 1-20 – add a footnote to the Level of Support column in each table –
“Unanimous Approval received from the KCAPC members present at the time of the
approval vote.”

•

Page 1-20 – in the first paragraph under the Perspectives on Policy Recommendations, add to
the end of the first sentence – “… based on the assumptions and data from 2010.”

•

Page 4-1 – add to the end of the first paragraph - “Those energy intensive industries provide
valuable goods and services to many states beyond the borders of Kentucky.”

•

Page 4-5 – second paragraph – add to the end of the first sentence – “, but can come with
substantial costs.”

•

Page 4-6 – top partial paragraph – delete the following text from the end of the first and
second lines on the page – “…when combined with the presumed increased costs for
fossil fuel generated electricity.” ( this text it is not needed to make the point and it is also
possible that fossil fuel generated technology costs could come down over time with
technological advances as well.)

•

Page 4-9 – add to the third bullet – “advanced natural gas combined cycle (NGCC)” (as
this technology was included in the policy descriptions.)

•

Page 4-11 and page 4-12 – shouldn’t both the FIT and the RPS paragraph descriptions have a
sentence to indicate that both are not necessarily required (it could be either one?) – suggest
adding at least a footnote to that affect.

J-2

•

Page 5-2 – the paragraph under Figure 5-1 quotes growth rates of 1.6% and 1.4% - add to the
first sentence at the end – “based on the assumptions and data from 2010.”

•

Page 5-4 – first paragraph under Key Challenges and Opportunities – suggest deleting the
word “abundant”

•

Page 5-4 – first paragraph under Key Challenges and Opportunities – what is the definition
of “green collar jobs” and who determines what those are? I suggest the reference to green
collar be deleted and we just refer to them as the jobs created by the energy efficiency
opportunities.

•

Page 5-9 – last sentence of the top paragraph – again the reference to “green collar jobs”
should be deleted and reworded.

•

Page 5-11 – last paragraph under RCI-5 – the term “Green Mortgages” appears here and in
the RCI appendix as well - I did not see this term used in any previous drafts of the policy
options from the TWGs work. It is not in the last set of options posted on the web. What is a
“green mortgage” and why is it here? Suggest it be removed from both places.

•

Page 7-1 – the first sentence in the second paragraph speaks to adoption of policy
recommendations by the KCAPC members present. Why is this sentence not utilized in each
of the policy sections?

Please let me know if these comments need further explanation.
Bob Amato, Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (10-17-11)
• In Chapter 1, page 1-7 has an omission: “individuals, companies, and/or government
agencies. In contrast, conventional cost-benefit analysis takes the “societal perspective,” and
tallies every conceivable impact on every entity in society (and quantifies these wherever
possible).” is omitted from the top of the page. (the last line of page 1-6 is left hanging.
•

Remove the “Level of Support” column from all of the Policy Recommendation tables in the
report.

•

cost-effectiveness of these generation technologies in Kentucky is uncertain. The costeffectiveness will improve over time with technological and fabrication advances when
combined with the presumed increased costs for fossil fuel generated electricity. Providing
incentives for wind and solar
power development Studying and testing and studying how and where these wind and solar
technologies might be best applied and then providing incentives will help ensure that
renewable energy opportunities are not missed.

The Kentucky Climate Action Plan Council (KCAPC) analyzed and is recommending for the
secretary’s consideration multiple policies and sub policies for the ES sector that offer the
potential for significant GHG emission reductions. The policies analyzed are summarized…

Some lacked data upon which to reasonably base analysis, and while others were enabling
policies that allow other subsequent policies to operate, but do not offer measurable
reductions on their own.

o Second sentence under ES-5:
Pricing strategies can be used to encourage energy efficiency, conservation, and demand
response. Some pricing mechanisms encourage utilities to facilitate their customers’
reduction in consumption, while others encourage customers to reduce consumption directly.
Three pricing strategies were analyzed. With a time-of-use pricing customers are charged a
different rate for electricity during different time blocks during the day corresponding to the
utility’s cost to produce electricity during that time.
o Second Paragraph under ES-5:
Interconnection rules and net metering policies can facilitate the cost-effective
interconnection and expansion of renewable and distributed energy resources onto the power
grid. , supporting the expansion of the supply of renewable electricity. The goal of this policy
is to establish effective net metering and interconnection rules to facilitate the connection of
renewable or distributed energy resources to the grid.
o Third Paragraph under ES-5:
A feed-in tariff (FIT) establishes above market rates for renewable power and mandates
electric utilities to purchase that renewable power under long-term contracts at these abovemarket rates. A Kentucky FIT should apply to the following renewable energy technologies:
solar, wind, low-impact biomass/biogas, and hydroelectric. Utilities would be mandated to
purchase power from any renewable energy generator within the state who meets the
technical requirements. Residential and small commercial systems would all be eligible to
participate.

It is acknowledged that the Kentucky Public Service Commission participated in discussing
the policy recommendations in this chapter. However, the Kentucky Public Service
Commission did not take a position for or against any policy recommendation that could

need additional statutory authority to consider some of the policy recommendations should
they be proposed by a regulated utility.

Negative cost effectiveness values reflect economic savings. It is important to note that some
of the policy options with an estimated cost savings still are likely to require significant upfront capital investments.

The CCI TWG developed eight policy recommendations for the secretary’s consideration
eight policies (see Table 7-1) that were then reviewed, revised, and ultimately adopted by the
KCAPC members present and voting. Seven of the recommendations are focused on
enabling GHG emission reductions and mitigation activities, while one (CCI-3–Adaptation
and Vulnerability) addresses adaptation to the changes expected from the effects of GHGs
that will remain in the atmosphere for decades.
