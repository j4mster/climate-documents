______________________________________________________________________________

October 15, 2008
Dear Governor Crist:
Since you issued Executive Order 07‐128 on July 13, 2007, the Governor’s Action Team on
Energy and Climate Change has worked diligently to develop this comprehensive Energy and
Climate Change Action Plan for the State of Florida.
This transmittal is the second and final report of the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and
Climate Change. The Action Team submitted its Phase 1 report in 2007 containing 35 findings
and 30 recommendations. This Phase 2 report details our collective 2008 work and provides 50
separate policy recommendations that will reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions and
provide a framework for climate change adaptation strategies to guide Florida over the coming
years and decades. Further, the Phase 2 report provides a separate set of comments toward the
current work to develop Florida’s cap‐and‐trade regulatory program, one of the provisions
contained in the 2008 Legislature’s landmark energy and climate change bill that you signed.
The principal charge provided to the Action Team has been to develop a plan that will fully
achieve or surpass the targets for statewide greenhouse gas reductions specified in Executive
Order 07‐127. If all of the recommendations in this plan were to be implemented, it is estimated
that:
•

Florida’s greenhouse gas emission reductions would surpass your Executive Order 07‐
127 emission reduction targets for 2017 and 2025, by 11 percent and 34 percent,
respectively;

•

Florida’s energy security would increase by reducing our dependence on fossil fuels
resulting in a total fuel savings of 53.5 billion gallons of petroleum, 200.2 million short
tons of coal, and 6.394 billion cubic feet of natural gas during the period of 2009 through
2025; and,

•

Florida’s economy would see a net benefit through investments in energy efficiency,
low‐carbon energy sources, and other greenhouse gas reduction strategies resulting in
an estimated total net cost savings of more than $28 billion from 2009 to 2025.

I could not possibly offer enough thanks to the 28 appointed members of the Governor’s Action
Team on Energy and Climate Change. At their own expense, they participated in this
unprecedented effort as a collegial yet dynamic panel, lending their expertise and judicious
thought. In the Phase 2 process, we also engaged more than 120 technical experts with resource
knowledge in six separate Technical Working Groups. I am truly grateful for their technical

wisdom and dedication to serving in these key roles and for ensuring the Action Team had the
latest and most complete science and data available. Also, the Center for Climate Strategies was
instrumental in developing this report, serving as the independent facilitator, providing
technical resources, and helping us ensure a public participation stakeholder process.
This second and final report of the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change is
an exciting marker in Florida’s journey on these issues, but it does not mark the end of the work
Florida has ahead. It is essential that the recently created Florida Energy and Climate
Commission continually track, update, and review these recommendations and analyses as
additional data and information become available.
On behalf of the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change, I want to thank you
for the opportunity to serve Florida in this critical and historic endeavor.

Michael W. Sole, Chairman

Executive Summary
During the past 14 months, the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (Action
Team) worked diligently to develop the Florida Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
(Action Plan). In keeping with the guidance provided in Executive Order 07‐128 by Florida
Governor Charlie Crist, the Action Team has developed this integrated Action Plan that will,
through careful coordination, secure Florida’s energy future, reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
and heavily support and sustain strategic economic development in the emerging “green tech”
sector.
The principal conclusions that have emerged from the Action Team process include:
• Based upon the findings of the 4th Assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change, Florida’s resources, communities, and economy are expected to
experience significant impacts if the current trajectory of global greenhouse gas
emissions is not reversed;
• Early action to address global climate change has significant energy security benefits for
Floridians, while positioning the state to become a regional and hemispheric hub of
green technology innovation and investment;
• Energy efficiency, demand‐side management, and energy conservation present Florida
with numerous opportunities to reduce energy costs, increase the buying power of
Florida’s families, and make the state’s business sector more cost‐competitive in the
global market;
• Investments today in low‐carbon energy sources – renewables, nuclear power, and
biofuels – will stimulate Florida’s economy and redirect current expenditures on
imported fossil fuels toward Florida‐based energy sources retaining significant flows of
money within local economies;
• Market‐oriented regulations – many already authorized in Florida law – will efficiently
guide a low‐carbon economy while protecting energy consumers, maintaining Florida’s
agricultural competitiveness, and building more sustainable communities.
This Phase 2 report provides 50 separate policy recommendations, plus an additional set of
comments toward the current regulatory work to develop Florida’s cap‐and‐trade program to
reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. These recommendations, if implemented, would
result in greenhouse gas emission reductions that would surpass the Governor’s 2017 and 2025
emission reduction targets by 11 percent and 34 percent, respectively. Additionally, while some
of the recommendations result in an overall societal cost to implement, many were identified to
have an overall societal cost‐savings. The total net cost savings of all Action Team
recommendations combined is more than $28 billion from 2009 to 2025. Additionally, the
recommendations would increase Florida’s energy security by reducing our dependence on
fossil fuels resulting in a total fuel savings of 53.5 billion gallons of petroleum, 200.2 million

short tons of coal, and 6.394 billion cubic feet of natural gas during the period of 2009 through
2025.
The Action Team completes its charge during a time of economic uncertainty. While it may be
assumed by some readers that the current economic environment would hamper Florida’s
progress toward a low‐carbon economy, the Action Team firmly believes that current economic
conditions precisely sharpen the “call to action” first issued by Governor Crist in 2007. Now is
the time for strategic investment in Florida’s low‐carbon energy infrastructure if we are to be
successful in diversifying the state’s economy, creating new job opportunities, and positioning
Florida’s “green tech” sector as an economic engine for growth.
The analyses and recommendations provided in the Action Plan are based on current data and
projections in the areas of science, demographics, energy consumption, and economics. As
Florida moves forward in implementing this Action Plan, it is essential that the Florida Energy
and Climate Commission continually update and review these analyses as additional data and
information become available.

Background
On July 12 and 13, 2007, Governor Crist hosted “Serve to Preserve: A Florida Summit on Global
Climate Change” in Miami. This unprecedented event gathered leaders of business,
government, science, and advocacy to examine the unique risks of climate change to Florida
and the nation, and to explore the economic development opportunities available through an
aggressive response to climate change. At the conclusion of the summit, Governor Crist signed
three Executive Orders and two partnership agreements (with Germany and Great Britain) to
propel Florida to the forefront of states actively working to address global climate change. One
of those orders, Executive Order 07‐128 established the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and
Climate Change and tasked it with creating a comprehensive Florida Energy and Climate
Change Action Plan to achieve or surpass the statewide targets for greenhouse gas reduction.
On November 1, 2007, the Action Team issued its Phase 1 report that recommended a range of
policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase Florida’s energy security. A number
of key issues were referred to Phase 2 for further study and more detailed recommendations.
At the outset of 2008, the State of Florida had a number of energy and climate change initiatives
under way. Many of these were in response to the three Executive Orders issued by Governor
Crist in 2007. The Legislature passed three bills during the 2008 Regular Session that
significantly impacted energy and climate change issues. The most notable is House Bill 7135
(HB 7135), which contains many provisions that are moving Florida aggressively forward in
energy security and climate change mitigation. While some of the recently enacted policies and
programs are in rulemaking, Florida can point to a significant number of early achievements in

state government greenhouse gas emissions reductions, private sector renewable energy
projects, utility‐based solar energy, energy efficiency, and related research and development.
The Action Team reconvened in February 2008 to begin Phase 2 of Executive Order 07‐128
requirements. As identified in the Action Team’s Phase 1 report, a facilitated, stakeholder‐
based, consensus‐building process was developed for Phase 2. The Center for Climate
Strategies facilitated and provided technical support for this phase of the process. As part of
this effort, the Action Team designated six Technical Working Groups to focus on specific issues
and sectors of the economy. The six Technical Working Groups were:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Energy Supply and Demand;
Transportation and Land Use;
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management;
Government Policy and Coordination;
Cap‐and‐Trade; and
Adaptation.

The Action Team and the Technical Working Groups worked diligently in order to meet the
October 2008 deadline for completion of this Phase 2 Report. The 28 Action Team members
appointed by the Governor gathered a total of eight times in Phase 2 during 2008, representing
more than 60 hours of deliberation as a full group. The 122 appointed members of the six
Technical Working Groups met more than 71 times on toll‐free, public access conference calls,
representing more than 155 hours of combined meeting time.
The Action Team’s recommendations in this Phase 2 Report build on Florida’s accomplishments
in 2007 and 2008 and point the way forward for 2009 and beyond.

Inventory of Florida’s Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In 2005, Florida’s gross emissions accounted for approximately 337 million metric tons of
carbon dioxide equivalent. Florida’s gross emissions of greenhouse gases grew by 35 percent
between 1990 and 2005 (roughly twice the national average of 16 percent), driven largely by the
growth of population and emissions associated with economic development. The state’s
emissions on a per capita basis remained relatively flat between 1990 and 2005, as compared to
U.S. per capita emissions, which declined slightly (2 percent) during the same period. In the
absence of recent developments that Florida has undertaken to control its emissions, gross
greenhouse gas emissions are projected to rise steeply to about 463 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent by 2025, or 86 percent more than 1990 levels.
Figure EX‐1 depicts the historical and projected gross greenhouse gas emissions by key sectors,
during the period from 1990 to 2025. The modeled gross emission levels are predicted using a

consumption‐based approach and represent the business as usual, or base case scenario.
Florida’s 16.7 million acres of forests serve to capture and store greenhouse gas emissions
(known as “carbon sinks”). On a net emissions basis (including carbon sinks), Florida
accounted for approximately 309 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of emissions
in 2005.

The principal sources of Florida’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 are electricity consumption
and transportation, accounting for 42 percent and 36 percent of Florida’s gross greenhouse gas
emissions, respectively. Other sources of greenhouse gases include emissions from; agriculture
and forest fires, waste management, industrial processes, industrial fuel use, residential fuel
use, and the fossil fuel industry. Figure EX‐2 depicts the 2005 gross greenhouse gas emissions
by each of these sectors in Florida and the U.S.

Action Team Recommendations
The Action Team recommends 50 policy actions relating to: energy supply and demand;
transportation and land use; agriculture, forestry, and waste management; government policy
and coordination; and adaptation strategies associated with climate change. For 28 of these
recommendations, the Center for Climate Strategies provided a specific analysis and
quantification of the estimated reduction in greenhouse gases associated with each
recommendation.
In addition, as part of the cap‐and‐trade discussion, the Action Team offers a suite of
recommendations as guidance to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection as its
cap‐and‐trade rulemaking occurs before submitting its market‐based emissions limiting
program to the Legislature for consideration and ratification in the 2010 Session (as required by
HB 7135).

Figure EX‐3 shows the total greenhouse gas emissions since 1990 and the reference case
projection of emissions from 2005 through 2025 (dark blue line). Below this reference case is a
family of lines that represent the contributions of each of the major recent and planned
measures resulting from Executive Order 07‐127, including improved building codes, utility
cap, state clean car standards, and appliance efficiency standards. The impact of these actions is
projected to be a 24 percent reduction from the reference case; and would result in a leveling of
Florida’s greenhouse gas emission growth. The green line represents the cumulative benefits of
the Action Team’s quantified policy recommendations. Assuming all recommended policies
are adopted, in 2017 total emissions would drop to 281.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent, or 30 percent below the reference case and 11 percent below the governor’s 2017
target. In 2025, assuming all recommended policies are adopted, total emissions would drop to
164.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, more than 64 percent below the reference
case and 34 percent below the Governor’s 2025 emissions target.

In order, the sectors with the greatest potential for emissions reductions are:
•

energy supply and demand at 56 percent of total reductions and a total net cost savings
of $19 per ton;
• agriculture, forestry, and waste management at 27 percent of total reductions and a net
cost of $13 per ton; and
• transportation and land use at about 15 percent of total potential emissions reductions
and a net cost savings of $86 per ton.
The total net cost savings of all Action Team recommendations combined (after adjustment for
overlaps and interactions) is more than $28 billion from 2009 to 2025, at an average net savings
of $18 per ton greenhouse gas emissions removed during the same period.

______________________________________________________________________________
Quantified recommendations are ranked in Figure EX‐4 according to their potential to reduce
emissions in 2025. This figure indicates that the greatest reductions are offered by the three
policy recommendations known as:
•

AFW‐4 (Expanded Use of Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management, Biomass
Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, and Steam Production);
ESD‐5 (Promoting Renewable Electricity through Renewable Portfolio Standard,
Incentives, and Barrier removal); and
ESD‐12 (Demand‐Side Management/Energy Efficiency Programs, Funds, or Goals for
Electricity).

•
•

Figure EX‐5 displays the recommendations according to their respective cost‐effectiveness, from
lowest cost (highest savings) to highest cost. Recommendations with negative numbers
represent a total net benefit to Florida’s economy after accounting for the costs to implement the
recommendation. In most of these cases, a specific investment will be required to initiate the
option. Policy recommendations TLU‐1 (Develop and Expand Low‐Greenhouse Gas Fuels) and
TLU‐2 (Low Rolling Resistance Tires and Other Add‐On Technologies) are the policies with the
lowest cost‐per‐ton reduced. Policy recommendation AFW‐6 (Reduce the Rate of Conversion of
Agricultural Land and Open Green Space to Development) has the highest cost per ton.

Figure EX‐6 displays the quantified policy recommendations in the form of a “cost curve” or
step‐function showing both policy costs and benefits in 2025. The vertical axis represents the
cost or cost savings (negative cost) for each recommendation, which are ranked from lowest
cost (highest savings) to highest cost. The horizontal axis represents the amount of greenhouse
gas reductions offered by the recommendation, computed as “percent reduction below
business‐as‐usual,” with each recommendation’s width proportional to its greenhouse gas
reduction potential. The wider the recommendation’s step, the greater the greenhouse gas
mitigation. Each policy moving to the right achieves an increased “percent reduction below
Business As Usual,” but at an increasing cost.

Unquantifiable Recommendations
Some recommendations within this report are not quantified. While many of these
unquantifiable policies were estimated by Technical Working Groups and the Action Team to
have the likely effect of producing emissions reductions and will involve net costs or cost
savings, some of them are foundational—that is, they enable other policies. The lack of
quantified results for these recommendations should not be seen as an indication that they are
less important or less valuable than the others.

______________________________________________________________________________
Adaptation
Adaptation represents a unique challenge for Florida. The product of the adaptation
investigation is a comprehensive planning framework to guide Florida over the coming years
and decades to manage climate impacts that Floridians will likely face regardless of the success
of state, national, or international mitigation efforts. The Adaptation recommendations are a
comprehensive first look at the issues and opportunities facing Floridians, and contain
recommendations for further study and examination as well as measures that can be
undertaken immediately to adapt to the many consequences of climate change that may occur
in the near future.
Cap‐and‐Trade
One area of investigation directly assigned to the Phase 2 process from the Phase 1 Report was
an examination of cap‐and‐trade program design. Shortly thereafter, HB 7135 directed the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection to initiate rulemaking to create a cap‐and‐
trade program for fossil‐fired electric generation plants. The Legislature identified 11 major
program design and policy questions to be addressed through rulemaking. The Action Team
Chairman (DEP Secretary Michael Sole) suggested that the Action Team provide pre‐
rulemaking guidance. Therefore, the Action Team asked CCS to perform economic modeling of
two policy alternatives, which examined the benefits of Florida joining one of two existing
regional climate initiatives. Those results are given in Appendix B. The modeling was not
utilized to estimate the cumulative greenhouse gas reductions (or the costs or benefits of the
alternatives) in a manner consistent with that used for the other quantified policies. Nor were
the emissions reductions and costs of the cap‐and‐trade options included in the total or
summary results. The cap‐and‐trade program is intended to be implemented concurrently with
other recommended policy actions, to guarantee that emissions targets are met within the
covered sectors, and, potentially, to generate additional reductions and cost savings.
Government Policy
The Government Policy and Coordination Technical Working Group presented five policies
that were ultimately adopted for recommendation by the Action Team. These policies fall into
two categories: efforts that enable or enhance the successful implementation of policies
recommended for specific sectors, and policies that foster the development and creation of
technologies and businesses that mitigate greenhouse gases and promote the creation of jobs
and economic growth. Finally, the Government Policy Coordination Technical Working Group
examined the multiple planning authorities at all levels of government in Florida, and the
Action Team has recommended measures to incorporate greenhouse gas considerations into
government planning processes and improve coordination among entities with overlapping
jurisdiction.

Energy Security
The Action Team focused considerable time and consideration on the issue of increasing
Florida’s energy security. Table EX‐3 provides a summary total of fuel savings for quantified
recommendations by fuel type. Figure EX‐7 shows the relative savings of petroleum by policy
recommendation. Figure EX‐8 shows each recommendation’s coal savings by million short
tons. Figure EX‐9 shows each recommendation’s natural gas savings in billions of cubic feet.

______________________________________________________________________________

The Science of Climate Change and
Its Importance and Opportunities for Florida
Executive Order 07‐128 created the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change
(Action Team) in the summer of 2007. The Action Team was tasked to develop a series of
recommendations for addressing climate change in Florida. A brief description of the science of
climate change and the potential impacts to Florida is provided here to assist the reader in
understanding the nature of these recommendations and the importance of taking action. There
are numerous benefits, both environmental and economic, which accrue both to the State of
Florida and the private sector due to pursuing energy efficiency and investing in alternative
energy technologies.

Natural Warming
The sun’s energy drives the Earth’s weather and climate and heats its surface. Some of this
energy radiates back into space, but some is trapped by naturally occurring greenhouse gases
(GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor, and other gases. GHGs are necessary to life
as we know it; because they keep the planet’s surface warmer than it would be otherwise.
However, as the concentrations of these gases continue to increase in the atmosphere, the
Earth’s temperature is rising above traditional levels. According to the U.S. National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
data, the Earth’s average surface temperature has increased by about 1.2 to 1.4° Fahrenheit in
the past 100 years. The eight warmest years on record (since 1850) have all occurred in the past
10 years (since 1998), with the warmest year being 2005.

Human Activities are Changing the Earth’s Climate
In May 2001, the White House asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to assess the
current understanding of climate change by answering key questions related to both causes of
climate change and projections of future change. The NAS released a report, Climate Change
Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions (2001), and a second report, Understanding and
Responding to Climate Change (2008), the latter of which stated, “… [C]limate changes observed
over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities” and “… additional
evidence collected over the past several years has increased confidence in this conclusion.”
The accumulation of some GHGs in the atmosphere is a natural part of the Earth’s climate
system and has been beneficial to our living environment. However, due to the extensive
combustion of fossil fuel and land use changes over the past several hundred years,
concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere now exceed pre‐industrial era amounts.
Between 1970 and 2004, global emissions increased by 70 percent, with a full 24 percent increase
occurring in the 14 years between 1990 and 2004. During that time, GHGs increased from 28.7 to

31

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
49 gigatons (GT). Of those, emissions of CO2 grew by about 80 percent between 1970 and 2004,
with the largest increase of 28 percent occurring during the 14 years between 1990 and 2004.1
The largest growth in global GHG emissions occurring between 1970 and 2004 came from the
energy supply sector, with a 170 percent increase. The next‐largest growth in emissions came
from the transportation sector with 120 percent, then the industrial sector with 65 percent, and
finally land use and forestry with 40 percent. Between 1970 and 1990, direct emissions from
agriculture grew by 27 percent. Without specific action, by 2030, global emissions of CO2 from
energy use are projected to grow from 45 percent to 110 percent more than emissions measured
in the year 2000.2
Fossil fuel consumption in automobiles and electric power plants worldwide results in the
emission of approximately 5.5 billion metric tons of CO2 each year, and deforestation
contributes an estimated additional 1.6 billion metric tons annually.3 GHG increases of methane
and nitrous oxide are due primarily to agricultural activities.
If GHGs continue to increase, climate models predict that the average temperature at the Earth’s
surface could increase from 2.5 to 10.4°F by 2100.4 Members of the NAS and the scientific
members of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are certain that human
activities are changing the composition of the atmosphere, and that increasing the concentration
of GHGs will change the planet’s climate.5 At this point in time, scientists do not know with
certainty how much it will change, at what rate it will change, or what the exact effects will be.

Florida’s Emissions of Greenhouse Gases
Florida’s gross GHG emissions increased from 248.8 million metric tons in 1990 to 336.6 million
metric tons in 2005 as shown in Figure 1. Florida’s GHGs come primarily from fossil fuel
combustion attributable to the utility and transportation sectors. The utility sector accounts for
44 percent of GHGs and the transportation sector accounts for 37 percent of GHGs. This means
that Florida’s GHGs are largely attributed to supplying consumer demand for electricity and
transportation. Future GHG growth in Florida is anticipated to come from these same sectors.

While climate science is complex and evolving, the scientific community has reached a strong
consensus regarding the science of global climate change. The world is undoubtedly warming.
This warming is largely the result of emissions of carbon dioxide and other GHGs from human
activities, including fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, and changes in land use, such
as deforestation. Although legitimate differences of opinion exist regarding the most effective
mix of policies to address this problem, mitigation of GHGs is the essential component.

The Effects of Global Climate Change on Florida
With the release of each new report by the IPCC and the NAS, the consequences of global
climate change are becoming better understood. By virtue of Florida’s geography, changes in
climate and sea level are of particular concern.
The impacts of climate change on Florida will result directly from an increase in air and water
temperatures, sea level rise, and a change in precipitation levels.

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Sea Level Rise—Higher temperatures are expected to raise sea level by expanding ocean
water, melting mountain glaciers and small ice caps, and causing portions of the coastal
section of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to melt or “slide” into the ocean. The IPCC
estimates that the global average sea level will rise between four and 35 inches, depending
on the magnitude of warming.

•

Future Precipitation and Storm Changes—Tropical storms and hurricanes are likely to
become more intense, produce stronger peak winds, and produce increased rainfall over
some areas due to warming sea surface temperatures (which can strengthen these storms).7

Each of these changes will impact the various sectors of Florida’s economy, such as health,
agriculture, forestry, water resources, coastal areas, and animal and sea‐life species.

•

Health—Human health can be affected directly and indirectly by climate change in part
through extreme periods of heat and cold, storms, and diseases spread by mosquitoes in
warm climates.8 Florida’s population of senior citizens, particularly those living alone,
would be most adversely affected by heat waves and heat‐related illnesses.9 Further, sea
surface warming could increase health threats from marine‐borne illnesses, shellfish
poisoning, and harmful algal blooms.10

•

Agriculture—Citrus crop yields could decrease with warmer temperatures in the
southernmost part of Florida because of the lack of a sufficient dormant period. Changes in
cotton and sorghum production are unclear because increasing CO2 levels and rainfall
would likely increase yields. However, the shorter growing season brought on by increasing
temperatures could result in plants producing fewer or smaller seeds and fruit.11 In the
short‐term, it appears there may be benefits in the agricultural section from global warming;
however, the effects in the long‐term are unknown.

•

Forestry—Changes in tree species, geographic extent, and the health and productivity of
forests can be expected with a warmer climate. The mixed conifer/hardwood forests found
in the northern and Panhandle sections of Florida are likely to retreat northward. These
forests eventually would give way to wet tropical forests such as tropical evergreen
broadleaf forests and dry tropical savanna. If conditions become drier, the current range of
forests could be reduced and replaced by grasslands and pasture.12

•

Water Resources—Evaporation is likely to increase with a warmer climate, and that could
result in lower river flow and lower lake levels during drier periods. If stream flow and lake
levels drop, groundwater could also be reduced. Saltwater intrusion from sea level rise
could threaten aquifers used for urban water supplies. These changes could further stress
South Florida’s water resources. In contrast, more intense rain could increase flooding in
some areas.13

•

Oceans – High water temperatures lead to the bleaching of coral, which is the expulsion of
the symbiotic algae that corals need for survival, growth, and reproduction. While some
corals can recover from bleaching other corals will be eliminated which will reduce local
and regional coral diversity. Ocean acidification is another impact of climate change on
oceans caused by the increases in atmospheric concentration of CO2. Higher CO2
concentration in the air increases the amount of CO2 dissolved in ocean waters. Increased
ocean acidity lowers the concentration of carbonate, which corals and other marine
organisms need to build their skeletons.14

•

Coastal Areas—As sea level rises, Florida’s wetlands and lowlands along the Gulf and
Atlantic coasts could be inundated. Adverse impacts in these areas could include loss of
land and structures, loss of wildlife habitat, accelerated coastal erosion, exacerbated
flooding and increased vulnerability to storm damage, and increased salinity of rivers, bays,
and aquifers, which would threaten supplies of fresh water.15

•

Land Plants and Animals—Scientists are seeing spring events occurring earlier each year.
In North America, a northern shift is occurring in plant and animal ranges. Scientists are
seeing shifts in ranges and changes in algal, plankton, and fish abundance in Florida
associated with rising water temperatures, as well as related changes in salinity, oxygen
levels, and circulation.16

If Florida and other states and nations act now to reduce GHG emissions, many of these effects
can be avoided, minimized, or mitigated. The actions necessary to reduce GHG emissions are
available to every household, every community, and every state in the nation. There is a cost
associated with some of these actions, but there is also a direct cost for failing to act.

Addressing Climate Change through a Market‐Based Solution
There is more than one method for encouraging the reduction in GHGs within the Florida
economy. Options range from taxing to mandatory cuts to seeking market‐based solutions. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had success in the 1980s with reducing acid rain through

the use of market‐based solutions, and many in the world believe the same can be accomplished
with GHGs. The market‐based solution being pursued by the European Union, as well as the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and the Western Climate Initiative here in the United States,
uses a cap‐and‐trade program to reduce emissions. This initiative is discussed at greater length
in Chapter 4. By seeking a market‐based solution to Florida’s climate change concerns, the
resulting economic stimulus will provide multiple benefits to the state. Not only will Florida
benefit by slowing climate change through reducing GHGs, but it will stimulate the economy
through the creation of new energy technologies, new business opportunities, new green jobs,
and a reduction in the state’s dependence on foreign sources of fuel, which translates to better
energy security.
Market mechanisms are an efficient means to address GHG reductions because these
mechanisms use price signals to provide incentives to individuals. To enhance the effectiveness
of market mechanisms, consumer outreach programs can educate citizens on the critical role
that everyday choices play in reducing GHG. By making conscious choices to conserve energy
and to use energy more efficiently, Floridians can make a measurable difference in reducing
GHG emissions.

Stimulating Economic Development
In order to address Florida’s energy future, the public and the private sector must invest in new
fuel sources, new technologies, new infrastructure, and more efficient homes, buildings,
appliances, and transportation. These investments also represent real business opportunities in
the private sector.
Florida Governor Charlie Crist has pointed out repeatedly that there are many commercial
opportunities that can be created by new economic ventures in Florida, specifically that “there
is gold in green” for Florida in alternative energy technologies. If Florida is successful in
expanding hydrogen, biomass, solar, wind, and ocean energy programs, it will be poised to
provide other states and nations with the technologies, expertise, and manufactured parts to
take advantage of Florida’s renewable energy industry. Entrepreneurs and businesses have the
opportunity to invest in new technologies and build an alternative energy market while
strengthening Florida’s economic future.
Efforts to address energy security and global climate change are creating new markets for
products and services that did not exist 20 years ago. One particular sector of Florida’s economy
that is already seeing new investments is agriculture. In order to reduce national reliance on
foreign sources of petroleum, the transportation sector is investing in biofuels. Evidence of the
economic opportunities in Florida for alternative fuels is offered by the success of the past three
Farm‐to‐Fuel programs sponsored by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services and with the movement of biofuel companies into the state and start‐ups created
within the state.
Businesses and investors are keenly interested in the new opportunities offered by alternative
fuels and emerging technologies. During both of Governor Crist’s “Serve to Preserve” Summits
36

______________________________________________________________________________
on Global Climate Change in 2007 and 2008, attendees heard the experiences of to both
emerging and established technology companies capitalizing on the commitment to develop
alternative forms of energy. At the state, national, and global levels, venture capitalists are
investing in the advanced energy technology sector. In 2006, venture capitalists invested $740
million into biofuel firms, compared with $111 million invested in 2005.17 The broader advanced
energy technology sector attracted $2.9 billion in venture capital in 2006, outpacing even the
Fiscal Year 2008 federal appropriations of $2.7 billion.18

Achieving Energy Security
Approximately 58 percent of the oil consumed by the United States is imported. Of total
imports, 49 percent originates in the Western Hemisphere, 21 percent from Africa, 16 percent
from the Persian Gulf, and 14 percent from others sources.19 Projected trends by the U.S.
Department of Energy show dependence on oil imports continuing to increase. In May 2001, the
National Energy Policy Development Group concluded that this imbalance, “…if allowed to
continue, will inevitably undermine our economy, our standard of living and our national
security.” Geopolitical challenges are driving the United States to focus on energy security by
increasing the domestic production of energy rather than depending on foreign nations.
The pursuit of energy security in the United States has focused on five main objectives:
1. Increase the energy efficiency of transportation, appliances, buildings, power plants, and
transmission lines;
2. Modernize energy infrastructure by adding new transmission facilities, retiring old
generators that release high emissions, and investing in public transportation;
3. Diversify the fuels used in the electric and transportation sectors;
4. Develop cleaner domestic fuels; and
5. Invest in and encourage alternative and new technologies.
Florida is looking to achieve those same objectives on a state level. Increasing energy efficiency
and conservation in our homes, offices, buildings, and industry can have the largest impact on
increasing energy security. In addition to every citizen taking personal responsibility to pursue
energy efficiency and conservation, the state must upgrade and modernize its energy
infrastructure. These upgrades need to come in the form of investments in cleaner electrical
generators, new transmission facilities that can accommodate renewable energy sources, and
public transportation systems.

______________________________________________________________________________
The fuel that drives Florida’s electric generators comes from out of state and out of the country.
For example, coal is delivered to Florida by rail or barge, natural gas is delivered through
pipelines, oil is delivered by tanker, and nuclear fuel is delivered by rail and truck. Florida
receives 98 percent of its transportation fuel by sea via barge and tanker ship into seven ports.
Any one of these transport systems that fuel Florida’s electricity and transportation sectors
could be, and has been, disrupted by a disaster or severe weather.
In an effort to diversify the state’s fuel supply and attempt to keep consumer costs affordable, a
number of Florida‐based utilities are looking at nuclear facilities for the first time in decades.
Because nuclear plants have zero GHGs in the production phase of their plant life cycle, nuclear
energy has taken on increased importance in strategies for meeting future energy demand. Two
Florida utilities have expressed interest and intent to expand current nuclear capacity or
construct new nuclear generating facilities. Through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the federal
government offers tax incentives, loan guarantees, and other subsidies for nuclear power
generation. Florida also enacted statutory provisions in 2006 and 2008 to allow for “advanced
cost recovery” for nuclear power and its associated transmission system. Ongoing concerns
regarding nuclear waste disposal remain a key issue that needs to be addressed.
Florida’s utilities are also increasing investments in energy efficiency and in renewable sources
of electricity generation. Important changes to Florida law enacted by the 2008 Florida
Legislature expanded the range of energy efficiency program coverage and provided added
incentives to utilities to achieve additional efficiency gains. Further, investments in renewable
sources of energy are increasing in Florida due to increased fossil fuel prices as well as a range
of policy actions that have removed market barriers, offset capital costs, and provided guidance
for the establishment of a renewable portfolio standard for Florida utilities.
In the transportation sector, national energy security issues focus on U.S. refineries. Currently,
domestic oil refineries are running at near‐maximum capacity and represent a bottleneck in the
oil supply chain. Due to environmental, safety, and aesthetic reasons, adding oil refinery
capacity is difficult. Biofuels may help stabilize near‐term oil prices by serving as fuel extenders,
allowing fuel companies to sell more gallons than their petroleum refineries are capable of
producing. Since biofuel plants do not pose as many of the same concerns as oil refineries, they
are viewed as a solution to the refinery capacity dilemma. As the demand for transportation
fuels increases, Florida’s infrastructure for producing, storing, and transporting that fuel or
biofuel to market will need to expand, including new storage capacity in some of Florida’s
ports.

Conclusion
Few single elements have as much economic impact and are as critical to the economic health of
the state as energy. Whether it is the electricity to run homes or businesses or the petroleum to
power transportation systems, energy is the lifeblood of the economy. Due to its economic
importance, one of the primary goals of Florida’s energy policy must be to ensure a clean,
reliable, fair, and affordable energy supply. This goal is consistent with reducing GHGs

because, by encouraging investment in energy efficiency and the use of clean renewable energy
sources, Florida will be reducing its demand for imported fuel and securing better sources of
energy for the future.
To position the state to take economic advantage of the emerging technology industry, Florida
must act now to reduce GHG emissions. Hand‐in‐hand with pursuing energy efficiency
measures that build on the 2008 Legislature’s work, Florida should encourage the development
of alternative energies to achieve the goals of:

•

Mitigating the potential impacts to Florida from climate change;

•

Further stimulating economic development in the state associated with the existing and
emerging alternative energy industries; and

•

Achieving energy security by reducing dependence on foreign fuels.

History and Status of State Actions
In recent years, the State of Florida has undertaken a number of actions to address the issues of
energy and climate change. For example, in 2006, the Legislature passed Florida’s first
comprehensive energy plan, prompted by a series of events, including very active 2004 and
2005 hurricane seasons that heightened concern over energy reliability, energy security, and
energy supply. More recently, the growing body of evidence in support of the threat posed by
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change led Florida Governor Charlie Crist to
intensify the state’s efforts to address these complex and interrelated challenges. The following
provides a brief overview of these and other efforts to date.

2007 Energy and Climate Change Initiatives
On July 12 and 13, 2007, Governor Crist hosted “Serve to Preserve: A Florida Summit on Global
Climate Change.” The first‐ever summit of its kind in Florida brought together leaders of
business, government, science, environmental stakeholders, and advocacy groups to examine
the risks to Florida and the nation posed by global climate change. At the conclusion of the
summit in Miami, Governor Crist signed three Executive Orders and two international
partnership agreements that propelled Florida to the forefront of states actively working to
address climate change.
Executive Order 07‐126 directed state government to “lead by example” by quantifying
operational emissions and meeting specific reduction targets by implementing a range of GHG
emission reduction efforts that impact state government facilities and vehicle fleets, and by
using the purchasing power of state government to promote energy efficiency and reduced
emissions.
Executive Order 07‐127 established reduction targets for utility sector GHG emissions in Florida.
Specifically, the Executive Order established the following emission reduction targets: by 2017,
reduce GHG emissions to 2000 levels; by 2025, reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels; and by
2050, reduce GHG emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels.
As first steps toward meeting these targets, the Executive Order directed the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to set maximum allowable GHG emissions
levels for electric utilities, adopt the California motor vehicle emission standards upon the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of the pending waiver, and adopt a statewide
diesel engine‐idling reduction standard.
The Executive Order further directed that modifications to the 2007 Florida Energy Code for
Building Construction include a 15 percent increase in energy efficiency performance as well as
a 15 percent increase in the energy efficiency of certain appliances sold in Florida by 2009.
Finally, it requested that the Florida Public Service Commission (PSC) adopt a 20 percent
Renewable Portfolio Standard with a strong focus on solar and wind energy, adopt the Institute

of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standard 1547 for Interconnecting Distributed Resources
with Electric Power Systems, and require net metering for on‐site renewable technologies of up
to one megawatt (MW) in capacity.
Executive Order 07‐128 established the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change
and tasked it with creating a comprehensive Florida Energy and Climate Change Action Plan to
achieve or surpass the statewide targets for GHG reduction specified in Executive Order 07‐127.
Executive Order 07‐128 provided the Action Team with a two‐phase process for submitting
recommendations. The Action Team was directed to submit its Phase 1 Report to the Governor
by November 1, 2007, and its Phase 2 report in October 2008.
The Governor signed partnership agreements with Germany and the United Kingdom focused
on climate policies and mutual economic benefits. Pursuant to these agreements, the State of
Florida is exchanging delegations with Germany and with the United Kingdom to create a
forum for sharing public policy experience and exchanging science and technology, placing a
particular emphasis on the sharing of ideas and policies related to energy efficiency and
renewable energy sources. The individual partnership agreements also will increase climate‐
friendly trade.
On August 13, 2007, Governor Crist appointed the first 21 members to the Action Team and
appointed DEP Secretary Michael Sole as Chairman and Mayor Rick Baker of the City of St.
Petersburg as Vice Chairman. Membership included a diverse cross section of stakeholders,
including representatives of business, utilities, academia, and environmental organizations. To
meet the first deadline set by Executive Order 07‐128, the Action Team conducted more than 36
hours of hearings. The Action Team listened to presentations from international, national, and
Florida‐based experts, dozens of members of the public, and other interested parties.
Phase 1 Report—Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan: On November 1, 2007, the
Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change issued its first report. The report’s 35
findings and 30 recommendations addressed the requirements outlined in Executive Order
07‐128, and were organized into the following key categories:
1. The power generation sector;
2. The transportation sector;
3. The government sector;
4. Organizing state government for Florida’s energy future; and
5. A blueprint for development of actions.

______________________________________________________________________________
The report recommended policies to:
• increase energy efficiency and conservation;
• examine the potential for capture, sequestration, and storage of carbon;
• expand the production of renewable energy; and
• further examine the role of nuclear energy in Florida.
The Action Team deferred until the Phase 2 Report a recommendation on the precise
mechanism for regulating carbon emissions in the state but did recommend pursuing the
design of a market‐based policy of cap‐and‐trade for tradable emissions credits; establishing
linkages with ongoing emissions trading markets; and reporting emissions to The Climate
Registry by the state’s electric utilities. The Action Team also recommended that DEP examine
and propose additional industry sectors for inclusion in mandatory emissions reporting.
The Action Team acknowledged the importance of transportation in reducing overall GHG
emissions. The report contained a series of transportation‐related recommendations, including
the incorporation of emission reduction strategies into local, state, and regional growth and
transportation planning; incentives for reducing vehicle miles traveled; and promotion of
efficient public transit systems and low‐carbon vehicles. The Action Team also recommended
continuing existing incentives for research and development of new fuels, as well as promoting
life cycle analyses for fuels in order to comprehend the full impact on the state’s resources and
environment.
Building on the requirements of Executive Order 07‐126, the Action Team identified additional
energy and emissions savings opportunities in state government operations and facilities. The
Phase 1 Report included recommendations to extend, by statute, the Executive Branch actions
contained in the Governor’s Executive Order to all other state government operations. The
Action Team also recommended removing any barriers to the use of energy performance
savings contracts for state government facilities, and providing incentives to assist local
governments in achieving green building or similar standards.
The Action Team examined the state’s roles in policy, energy regulation, program
implementation, and research and market development, and recommended that the state foster
greater public‐private cooperation with universities and other research centers to develop a
low‐carbon and alternative energy/technology market in Florida.
Finally, the Action Team recommended the use of a facilitated stakeholder process to in Phase 2
develop the detailed emission reduction strategies that would provide the blueprint for
development of actions contained in the final Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action
Plan. The Action Team recognized that the stakeholder process must be guided by rigorous
analyses of the costs and benefits of various policy options.

2008 Energy and Climate Change Initiatives
At the outset of 2008, the State of Florida had a number of energy‐ and climate change‐related
initiatives under way. The Governor’s Action Team resumed deliberations and intensified its
examination of policy recommendations for its Phase 2 Report. Meantime, the Florida Energy
Commission (created by the 2006 Legislature) submitted its final report about this same time,
which contained a wide range of recommendations relating to energy affordability, security,
efficiency, reliability, and climate change. The Florida Senate and the House of Representatives
also embarked on their own respective inquiries into energy and climate change issues, holding
committee workshops with experts chosen by the committees.
2008 Energy Legislation—During the 2008 Regular Session, the Legislature enacted several bills
that significantly impacted energy and climate change issues. The most notable legislation was
House Bill 7135 (“The Energy, Climate Change, and Economic Security Act of 2008”). This
comprehensive energy bill codified many of the provisions contained in Governor Crist’s 2007
Executive Orders. By drawing on the efforts of the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and
Climate Change, the Florida Energy Commission, and the extensive deliberations of the Senate
and House of Representatives, the bill:

•

Created the Florida Energy and Climate Commission within the Executive Office of the
Governor to centralize energy and climate change policy development and program
implementation;

•

Authorized the DEP to develop cap‐and‐trade regulations for GHG emissions for sources in
Florida, subject to legislative ratification in the 2010 Regular Session;

•

Expanded key economic development programs to attract specific investments in the
renewable energy sector to Florida;

•

Adopted a “10 by 10” Renewable Fuel Standard requiring that all gasoline sold for motor
vehicles in Florida contain 10 percent ethanol by 2010;

•

Required the PSC to develop rules for a renewable portfolio standard subject to legislative
ratification in the 2009 Regular Session and provided cost recovery guidance to the PSC for
renewable energy projects developed in advance of the final rule;

•

Required major emitters to report GHG emissions via The Climate Registry;

•

Required the reduction of energy consumption and associated GHG emissions from local
and state government operations by requiring that public buildings be constructed to meet
recognized green building standards; by considering energy and climate performance in
vehicle, commodity, and meeting space procurement; by promoting active energy
management among state agencies; and by increasing energy and water efficiencies from
government facilities by streamlining existing statutes governing guaranteed performance
savings contracts;

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Increased the role of energy efficiency in Florida’s energy policy through revisions to the
Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act, provided goals for the Florida Building
Commission to increase efficiency standards by 10 percent in each triennial review and
achieve a 50 percent increase by 2019, and increased efficiency requirements for certain
appliances;

•

Created the Florida Energy Systems Consortium within the State University System to
better coordinate energy‐related research in support of Florida’s energy and climate change
policy objectives; and

•

Balanced the need for expanded electric transmission infrastructure within Florida with the
need for conservation land protection and informed public participation in the siting
process by providing the terms and conditions for use of state lands; clarifying timelines in
the transmission line siting process; and increasing public participation through new mail
notice requirements and additional hearings for local residents.

On June 25 and 26, 2008, Governor Crist convened the second Annual “Serve to Preserve: A
Global Summit on Climate Change.” The Governor was joined by members of the Florida
Legislature for the signing of House Bill 7135, the landmark 2008 energy legislation. The 2008
summit focused not only on the need to pursue alternative fuels for environmental reasons, but
also for the economic benefits brought about by the infusion of green technologies. At the
conclusion of the summit, Governor Crist signed a new public‐private partnership making
Florida among the first states to join the Alliance for Sustainable Air Transportation, which
places a premium on energy conservation and air travel safety.
Phase 2 Report—Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan: Pursuant to Executive Order
07‐128, the Action Team reconvened in February 2008 to begin Phase 2. Governor Crist
expanded the membership of the Action Team from 21 to 27 voting members and retained a 28th
ex officio member. Additionally, the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) was asked to help
facilitate and provide technical support. CCS worked with DEP in the development of a
stakeholder‐based consensus‐building process.
As part of this effort, the Action Team designated six Technical Working Groups to focus on
specific issues and sectors of the economy and tasked them with responsibility for providing
technical analysis and designing policy options for consideration by the full Action Team. The
Technical Working Groups consisted of Action Team members (as the minority) as well as other
individuals with interest and expertise in issues being addressed (as the majority). The six
Technical Working Groups were:

•

Energy Supply and Demand;

•

Cap‐and‐trade;

•

Transportation and Land Use;

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management;

•

Government Policy and Coordination; and

•

Adaptation Strategies.

The Action Team and Technical Working Groups worked diligently to meet the October 2008
deadline for completion of the Phase 2 Report. The 28 Action Team members met a total of eight
times, representing more than 60 hours of deliberation. The 122 members of the six Technical
Working Groups met 71 times, representing more than 155 hours of combined meeting time.
Their respective recommendations are the substance of this report and are discussed at length
in subsequent chapters and appendices.

Current Status of Energy and Climate Change Initiatives
While many of the recently enacted policies and programs still might be considered to be in the
developmental stage, the State of Florida can point to a significant number of early
achievements. Similarly, a number of private sector entities, local governments, community‐
based organizations, and academic institutions have launched their own energy‐ and climate
change‐related initiatives. As a result, Florida is increasingly recognized as a leader in
addressing the challenges and opportunities associated with energy and climate change. The
following are examples of these accomplishments:
Leading by Example—Through the establishment of the Florida State Greenhouse Gas Reduction
Scorecard, the state has generated the first comprehensive assessment of GHG emissions from
state government‐owned vehicles and facilities. The Department of Management Services has
implemented Environmentally Preferred Purchasing to assist state entities in the purchase of
climate‐friendly products. DMS also has established programs to support energy performance
contracting in state facilities, and increased fuel efficiency in the state’s motor vehicle fleet.
GHG Emission Reductions—The Florida DEP has issued its proposed rule for reducing emissions
resulting from long‐duration on‐road diesel engine idling and is in the process of rule
development for adoption of the California motor vehicle emissions standards. The DEP
continues the rule development process in support of a cap‐and‐trade program to reduce GHG
emissions from electric utilities.
Renewable Energy—The PSC has adopted new rules to promote the development and
interconnection of customer‐owned renewable generation and minimize costs for customers
attempting to interconnect to their utility service. The rules encourage the development of
renewable generation by expanding the size of eligible systems, expanding the type of eligible
systems from solely photovoltaic to all renewable technologies, expediting the interconnection
of customer‐owned renewable generation, and allowing customers to offset consumption
through net metering. The PSC is continuing its rule development process in support of the
establishment of a statewide Renewable Portfolio Standard.
A number of Florida utilities have taken the initiative to expand renewable energy production.
For example, one Florida‐based utility has received approval to begin construction of three solar
45

______________________________________________________________________________
energy centers that will make Florida the second‐largest supplier of utility‐generated solar
power in the nation. Similarly, several utilities are aggressively pursuing additional biomass
and co‐firing opportunities. A number of Florida’s municipal and cooperative utilities have
launched their own solar and biomass generation initiatives.
Energy Efficiency—As previously noted, Florida agencies are implementing a wide range of
programs designed to increased energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions within state
government operations. The Florida Building Commission is finalizing revisions to the Florida
Building Code that will significantly enhance the energy efficiency of new buildings
constructed in Florida. Almost 300 hotels and motels around the state have been designated and
recognized in the DEP’s Florida Green Lodging Program, a public‐private partnership that
encourages the lodging industry to adopt energy efficient and sustainable practices.
Numerous utilities and local governments have established financial incentives and related
programs to encourage the adoption of energy efficiency improvements by consumers. Through
a myriad of grant, loan, and rebate programs, these entities are making a variety of energy
efficiency measures (increased insulation, solar hot water heating, high‐efficiency appliances
and HVAC, building envelope improvements, etc.) more affordable to home and building
owners.
Energy Policy Governance—Effective July 1, 2008, the Governor’s Energy Office was established
within the Executive Office of the Governor to centralize and strengthen Florida’s energy policy
development capabilities. This office staffs and supports the Florida Energy and Climate
Commission, the nine‐member long‐term panel created by HB 7135 and appointed by the
Governor (7), Chief Financial Officer (1), and Commissioner of Agriculture and Consumer
Services (1).
Investment Policies – In recognition of the emerging risks associated with climate change, Florida
became the first state in the nation to institute a process to formally analyze investments for the
financial impacts of climate change. This initiative, coordinated through Chief Financial Officer
Alex Sink, will assess how public fund managers incorporate climate risk in portfolio holdings
as part of prudent investment management. Similarly, Florida has joined with a dozen other
states representing more than $1.5 trillion in assets under management to create an action plan
to boost fund investments in energy efficiency and clean energy technologies as well as require
tougher scrutiny of carbon‐intensive investments that may pose long‐term financial risks.
Energy‐related Research—The recently created Florida Energy Systems Consortium is focusing on
a range of projects that have the highest potential of generating near‐term impact given the
cumulative expertise and infrastructure of all 11 state universities. Areas of focus include, but
are not limited to, development of an integrated bioenergy industry; solar thermal power for
bulk power and distributed generation; development of Florida’s vast ocean energy potential;
Florida‐based low‐cost manufacturing of photovoltaic systems; integration of photovoltaic

storage/lighting systems; energy‐efficient building technologies and zero‐energy homes; and
efficient and reliable energy delivery infrastructure.

Conclusion
During the past two years under Governor Crist, Florida has established a solid foundation of
policies and programs in response to the increasingly clear dangers associated with climate
change. Through the leadership of Governor Crist and the Legislature, the state has acted not
only to address the challenges but also to create an atmosphere where Floridians can benefit
economically from emerging alternative energy technologies and processes. While the early
indications are promising, more work is necessary in the coming years. This report is intended
to provide specific strategies that put Florida on the path toward further significant emissions
reductions meet the state’s overall goals.

Chapter 1
Background and Overview
Action Team and Technical Work Group Deliberations
The Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (the Action Team) held its first
meeting of the Phase 2 process on February 1, 2008, followed by nine months of intensive fact‐
finding and consensus building. During this period, the Action Team’s six Technical Working
Groups (TWGs) were instrumental in developing specific findings and recommendations for
Action Team consideration. The six TWGs are:
•

Energy Supply and Demand;

•

Cap‐and‐Trade;

•

Transportation and Land Use;

•

Agriculture, Forestry and Waste Management;

•

Government Policy Coordination; and

•

Adaptation Strategies.

The Action Team’s deliberations relied on a facilitated, stepwise consensus‐building approach.
With oversight by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the process was
conducted by the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS), an independent facilitation and technical
analysis team. The facilitated process was based on procedures used by CCS in a number of
other state‐level climate change planning initiatives, but adapted specifically for Florida.
CCS provided facilitation and technical assistance to each of the TWGs and the Action Team.
The TWGs consisted of Action Team members as well as individuals with an interest in and
expertise regarding the issues being addressed by each TWG. The members of the TWGs were
appointed by the Action Team Chairman. The TWGs served as independent advisers to the
Action Team and generated initial recommendations on policy recommendations. With the
guidance and approval of the Action Team they developed draft proposals on the design
characteristics and, where possible, quantified the proposed policy recommendations. When
members of a TWG did not fully agree on a recommendation to the Action Team, the summary
of their effort was reported to the Action Team for further consideration and action. The Action
Team then made all final decisions.
Through this process, the Action Team reached technical consensus on specific mitigation
options and findings related to benefits, costs, and feasibility issues associated with the options,
followed by the development of consensus on individual policy recommendations. The Action
Team sought but did not mandate consensus, and it explicitly documented the level of support
for individual recommendations and mitigation options.

Chapter 2
Inventory and Projections of Florida GHG Emissions
Introduction
During Phase 1 of the Action Team process, the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP) prepared a preliminary inventory and reference case projections of emissions.
That preliminary inventory and reference case projections was revised, updated, and completed
by the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) in June 2008 to provide the Action Team and its
Technical Work Groups (TWGs) an understanding of past, current, and possible future GHG
emissions in Florida, and to inform the policy recommendation development process. Since
that time, the Action Team and TWGs have reviewed, discussed, and evaluated the draft
inventory and methodologies, as well as alternative data and approaches for improving the
draft GHG inventory and forecast. Based on that review, the inventory and forecasts have been
revised to address the comments provided by the Action Team and the TWGs. The information
in this chapter reflects the information presented in the final Florida Greenhouse Gas Inventory and
Reference Case Projections report (hereafter referred to as the Inventory and Projections report)
also provided on the Center for Climate Strategies’ Web site at
http://www.flclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm.1
Historical GHG emissions estimates (1990 through 2005)2 were developed using a set of
generally accepted principles and guidelines for state GHG emissions inventories, relying to the
extent possible on Florida‐specific data and inputs. The reference case projections (2006‐2025)
are based on a compilation of various existing projections of electricity generation, fuel use, and
other GHG‐emitting activities, along with a set of simple, transparent assumptions described in
the final Inventory and Projections report.
The Inventory and Projections report covers the six types of gases included in the U.S. GHG
inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative
contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential‐weighted basis.3

The last year of available historical data for each sector varies between 2000 and 2005.

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth–atmosphere system (IPCC, 2001). Holding everything else
constant, increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net
increase in the absorption of energy by the Earth). See: Boucher, O., et al. ʺRadiative Forcing of Climate Change.ʺ

There are two ways to account for emissions: either through a consumption‐based approach or
through a production‐based method. It is important to note that the emissions estimates used
here reflect the GHG emissions associated with the electricity sources used to meet Florida’s
demands, corresponding to a consumption‐based approach to emissions accounting. Another
way to look at electricity emissions is to consider the GHG emissions produced by electricity
generation facilities in the state—a production‐based method. The study covers both methods of
accounting for emissions, but for consistency, all total results are reported as consumption‐
based.

Florida GHG Emissions: Sources and Trends
Table 2‐1 provides a summary of GHG emissions estimated for Florida, by sector, for 1990, 2000,
2005, 2010, 2020, and 2025. As shown in this table, Florida is estimated to be a net source of
GHG emissions (positive emissions, or gross emissions). Since Florida’s forests and forested
acreage serve as “carbon sinks” of GHG emissions (removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, or
negative emissions), Florida’s net emissions is arrived at by subtracting the equivalent GHG
reduction capacity of emission sinks from the gross GHG emissions totals. The following
sections discuss GHG emission sources, sinks, trends, projections, and uncertainties.

Historical Emissions
Overview
In 2005, on a gross emissions consumption basis (excluding carbon sinks), Florida accounted for
approximately 337 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2e emissions, an amount equal to 4.7 percent
of total U.S. gross GHG emissions. On a net emissions basis (including carbon sinks), Florida
accounted for approximately 309 MMtCO2e of emissions in 2005, an amount equal to 4.9 percent
of total U.S. net GHG emissions.4 Florida’s GHG emissions are rising faster than those of the
nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005, Florida’s gross GHG emissions increased by 35 percent,
while national gross emissions rose by 16 percent.5

During this period, population grew by 38 percent in Florida and by 19 percent nationally. However, Florida’s
economy grew at nearly the same rate on a per capita basis as the nation (up 32 percent in Florida compared to 33
percent nationally).

On a per capita basis, Florida emitted about 19 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e in 2005, lower than
the national average of about 24 tCO2e. Figure 2‐1 illustrates the state’s emissions per capita and
per unit of economic output. It also shows that Florida per capita emissions have remained
relatively flat between 1990 and 2005, similar to the nation as a whole. In both Florida and the
nation as a whole, economic growth exceeded emissions growth throughout the 1990‐2005
period. From 1990 to 2005, emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 26 percent, both in
Florida and nationally.6
The principal sources of Florida’s GHG emissions in 2005 are electricity consumption and
transportation – these account for 42 percent and 36 percent, respectively, of Florida’s gross
GHG emissions, as shown in Figure 2‐2. The direct use of fuels—natural gas, oil products, coal,
and wood—in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors accounts for 6 percent of
the state’s emissions in 2005, significantly lower than the RCI sector contribution for the nation
at 22 percent.

The agricultural and forest wildfire sectors together account for 6 percent of the gross GHG
emissions in Florida in 2005. These methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions primarily
come from agricultural soils, rice cultivation, enteric (intestinal) fermentation, and manure
management. Landfills and wastewater management facilities produce CH4 and N2O emissions
that account for 5 percent of total gross GHG emissions in Florida in 2005. These emissions
include:

•

CH4 emissions from municipal and industrial solid waste landfills;

•

CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions from the combustion of solid waste at open residential
sites or in incinerators; and

•

CH4 and N2O from municipal wastewater and CH4 from industrial wastewater
treatment facilities.

Also, industrial process emissions accounted for another 4 percent of the state’s GHG emissions
in 2005, and these emissions are rising due to the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as
substitutes for ozone‐depleting chlorofluorocarbons.7 In addition, emissions associated with the
production, processing, transmission, and distribution of fossil fuels accounted for 0.5 percent
of the gross GHG emissions in 2005.
Forestry emissions refer to the net CO2 flux8 from forested lands in Florida, which account for
about 47 percent of the state’s land area.9 Florida’s forests are estimated to be net sinks of CO2
emissions in the state, reducing net GHG emissions by 27 MMtCO2e in 2005.

Reference Case Projections
Relying on a variety of sources for projections, a simple reference case projection of GHG
emissions through 2025 was developed. This is illustrated in Figure 2‐3 and shown numerically
in Table 2‐1. Under the reference case projections, Florida’s gross GHG emissions would
continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 463 MMtCO2e by 2025, or 86 percent above 1990
levels. This equates to a 1.6 percent annual growth rate from 2005 to 2025. By 2025,
transportation emissions would increase to 43 percent while emissions from electricity
consumption would decrease to 34 percent. In addition, emissions from industrial processes
would increase to 8 percent while emissions from the RCI sector would decrease to 5 percent.
Therefore, emissions associated with the transportation sector are projected to be the largest
contributor to future GHG emissions growth in Florida, followed by emissions associated with
the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone‐depleting substances (ODS) in
refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. Other sources of emissions growth
include electricity consumption, as well as the waste management sector, as shown in Figure 2‐
4. Table 2‐2 summarizes the growth rates in the Florida reference case projections.
Chlorofluorocarbons are also potent GHGs; however, they are not included in GHG estimates because of concerns
related to implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Affect the Ozone Layer. See Appendix I in the
Final Inventory and Projections report for Florida (http://www.flclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm).

A Closer Look at the Two Major Sources: Electricity Consumption and
Transportation
As shown in Figure 2‐2, electricity use in 2005 accounted for 42 percent of Florida’s gross GHG
emissions (about 142 MMtCO2e), which is much higher than the national share of emissions
from electricity generation (34 percent). On a per capita basis, Florida’s GHG emissions from
electricity consumption are slightly lower than the national average (in 2005, 7.9 tCO2e per
capita in Florida, versus 8.1 tCO2e per capita nationally). Electricity generation in Florida comes
from a diverse mix of natural gas (38 percent of Florida gross electricity production in 2005),
coal (28 percent), petroleum (17 percent), and nuclear (13 percent) fuels. Florida imports 10
percent of its electricity from out of state.
As noted above, these electricity emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with
the electricity sources used to meet Floridaʹs demand for electricity, corresponding to a
consumption‐based approach to emissions accounting. For many years, Florida power plants
have produced less electricity than is consumed in the state. In 2005, for example, emissions
associated with Florida’s electricity consumption (142 MMtCO2e) were about eight MMtCO2e
higher than those associated with electricity production (134 MMtCO2e). The higher level for
consumption‐based emissions reflects GHG emissions associated with net imports of electricity
from coal burning generators in other states to meet Florida’s electricity demand.10 Projections
of electricity sales and generation for 2005 through 2025 nominally show Florida’s imports of
electricity falling to zero by 2017 as current firm import contracts expire11, though it is
Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in‐state and out‐of‐state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimate reflects some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A of the Inventory and Projections report.
10

Import trends used in the revision of the Action Team forecast of electricity sales, production, and electricity sector
emissions were taken from the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC) report ʺ2008 Regional Load &
Resource Planʺ, published in July, 2008. As noted above, it is recognized that though imports in the FRCC report
11

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
recognized that some of these contracts may be renewed, and that Florida will continue to
import electricity for the entire period. The reference case projection assumes that production‐
based emissions (associated with electricity generated in‐state) will increase by about 24
MMtCO2e between 2005 and 2025, and consumption‐based emissions (associated with
electricity consumed in‐state) will increase by about 16 MMtCO2e, reflecting the underlying
assumption that emissions from electricity imports are decreasing over this time period.
While estimates are provided for emissions from both electricity production and consumption,
unless otherwise indicated, the tables, figures, and totals in this report reflect electricity
consumption emissions. The consumption‐based approach, which is largely unaffected by
assumptions regarding power imports, better reflects the emissions (and emission reductions)
associated with activities occurring in Florida, particularly with respect to electricity use (and
efficiency improvements), and is particularly useful for decision‐making. Under this approach,
emissions associated with electricity exported to other states would need to be covered in those
states’ inventories in order to avoid double‐counting or exclusions.
Like electricity emissions, GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily from
1990 to 2005, at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent. In 2005, gasoline‐powered on‐road
vehicles accounted for about 63 percent of transportation GHG emissions; on‐road diesel
vehicles for 15 percent; marine vessels for 12 percent; aviation fuels for 9 percent; and rail and
other sources (natural gas‐ and liquefied petroleum gas‐fueled vehicles used in transport
applications) accounted for the remaining 1 percent. As a result of Florida’s population and
economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles traveled (VMT), emissions from on‐road
gasoline use increased at an annual rate of 2.5 percent from 1990 to 2005. Meanwhile, emissions
from on‐road diesel use increased by 4.3 percent per year from 1990 to 2005 suggesting an even
more rapid growth in freight movement within the state. Emissions from on‐road gasoline
vehicles in 2025 are projected to increase by 2.6 percent annually from 2005 levels, and
emissions from on‐road diesel vehicles are projected to increase by 4.1 percent annually from
2005 to 2025, with total transportation emissions expected to reach 200 MMtCO2e by 2025.

Action Team Revisions
The Action Team made the following revisions to the inventory and reference case projections,
which explain the differences between the final Inventory and Projections report and the draft
initial assessment completed in June 2008:
•

Electricity Consumption: The electricity supply forecast was revised based on information
from the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC) forecasts, as modified based on
recommendations from the Energy Supply and Demand TWG. Key revisions are:

trend to zero by the end of the FRCC planning period (2017), imports at some level are, in fact, highly likely to
continue past that date.

•

o

Florida Electricity Sales: Using TWG recommendations, sales in 2025 are 8.8
percent lower than the original (AEO2007‐based) Action Team forecast, and 13.2
percent lower than the (extrapolated) FRCC forecast.

o

Transmission and Distribution (T&D) losses: FRCC estimates T&D losses as a
fraction of net generation increase over 2008‐2013, and are substantially higher
(at about 8 percent of net generation in 2013, remaining stable thereafter) than in
the original Action Team forecast (based on U.S. Department of Energy Annual
Energy Outlook figures).

Revised estimates of electricity generation by type of generation: There is
considerably more nuclear and gas‐fired electricity, and considerably less coal‐
and oil‐fired generation, than in the earlier forecast prepared for the Action
Team.

•

•

A University of Florida report on soil carbon was utilized to update emissions
from the cultivation of organic soils. (Original emissions were based on 1997 U.S.
Department of Agriculture data.)

Waste Management:
o

DEP provided supplemental landfill facilities information to update the data
from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Landfill Methane Outreach
Program. Gaps in activity data were augmented with average values and
assumptions (described in Appendix G of the Inventory and Forecast report).

o

Solid waste landfills and emissions were separated into five groups: Municipal
Solid Waste (MSW) Landfill Gas‐to‐Energy, MSW Flared, MSW Uncontrolled,
MSW Uncontrolled and Closed Over 15 Years, and Industrial Landfills.

o

Historic (2000‐2005) growth in emissions from landfills were used as growth
rates for projecting 2006‐2025 emissions from waste landfilled.

Forestry and Land Use:
o

The Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management TWG provided an updated
U.S. Forest Service report, Florida’s Forests – 1995, which was used to revise
historic forest carbon flux values for 1987‐1995 and 1995‐2005.

o

Projections in forest land carbon flux (2005‐2025) were originally kept at 2005
levels. The revised projections take into account annual forest area losses based
on U.S. Forest Service reports: Florida’s Forests – 1995, and Florida’s Forests ‐ 2005.

o

In addition to wildland fire emissions, the Florida Division of Forestry provided
activity data for prescribed burning, which increased the overall emissions from
forest fires. Also, forest fires emission forecasts were revised to reflect historic

average emissions; this was done due to uncertainty in future forest fire
projections and wide annual fluctuations in acres of forest area burned.

Key Uncertainties
Some data gaps exist in this inventory, and particularly in the reference case projections. Key
tasks for future refinement of this inventory and forecast include review and revision of key
drivers (such as the transportation, electricity demand, and waste management growth rates)
that will be major determinants of Florida’s future GHG emissions (See Table 2‐2 and Figure 2‐
4). These growth rates are driven by uncertain economic, demographic, and land use trends
(including growth patterns and transportation system impacts), all of which deserve closer
review and discussion.

Chapter 3
Energy Supply and Demand (ESD)
Overview of Sectoral Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The Energy Supply and Demand (ESD) sector includes all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that
are associated with energy usage in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors, as
well as emissions from the electricity supply sector. These combined sectors are responsible for
the majority of Florida’s GHG emissions — 53 percent of the total in 2005. The state’s future
trends in GHG emissions therefore will depend heavily on future activities and climate policies
in the ESD arena. ESD emissions can be separated into two categories – emissions that occur as
fuels are used on‐site at RCI buildings and facilities, and emissions that occur at sites where
electricity is produced.
Direct emissions of GHGs from the RCI sectors result principally from the on‐site combustion of
natural gas, oil, and coal, plus non‐energy sources of GHG emissions. Some examples include
carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during cement production; the use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6)
in the utility industry; the leakage of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) from refrigeration and related
equipment; and the release of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) during oil and gas
production and distribution. In Florida, direct emissions from RCI sectors in 2005 account for 11
percent of total GHG emissions – 6 percent from on‐site combustion and 5 percent from non‐
energy sources.
Considering only the direct emissions that occur within buildings and industries, however,
ignores the GHG emissions associated with electricity use in these facilities. Virtually all
electricity sold in Florida is consumed as the result of activities in the RCI sectors. Emissions
associated with producing the electricity consumed in Florida were responsible for about 42
percent of Florida’s total GHG emissions in 2005. Since Florida imports almost 10 percent of its
electricity from other states, the GHG emissions associated with the imported electricity are
included in the accounting of Florida’s total emissions.
Figure 3‐1 shows GHG emissions from the ESD sectors by fuel type from 2005 through 2025,
and illustrates the large fraction of emissions associated with electricity use. As described in
Chapter 2, Inventory and Projections, estimates of future GHG emissions are based on
projections from the Florida Reliability Coordination Council, the U.S. Energy Information
Administration, and other sources. The resulting forecasts indicate that GHG emissions from
the ESD sectors will increase by 24 percent from 2005 to 2025, with large increases expected
from industrial process activities.

repeats the GHG emissions associated with electricity use in Figure 3‐1, but provides additional
information on the GHG emissions associated with different fuels used to produce electricity.
(Nuclear and renewable power do not appear in Figure 3‐2 because consumption of these
resources does not directly result in GHG emissions.) As indicated, GHG emissions from
electricity use increase by 11 percent from 2005 to 2025, even as electricity sales increase by 39
percent over the same time period. Florida’s electricity sector is projected to be less GHG‐
intensive due to a combination of more nuclear power and more efficient natural gas
generation, and less coal and petroleum generation. See Chapter 2 for more information on
reference case projections from the electricity sector.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
As shown in the above charts, Florida’s GHG emissions from ESD could increase by 24 percent
between now and 2025. Florida’s increasing population and economic growth, combined with
increases in energy consumption per person, are key drivers for this projected increase in
emissions. While countering the growth in emissions from the ESD sectors is no small
challenge, Florida has a number of opportunities to reduce emissions. The choice and
implementation of which climate policies and supporting initiatives will be key to helping
citizens and businesses take full advantage of these reduction opportunities.
The opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from ESD in Florida include improving energy
efficiency in new and existing buildings and industrial facilities, using renewable resources and
other low‐GHG energy sources (such as solar water heating, photovoltaics, biomass, and
nuclear power) to replace fossil fuels for producing electricity and heat, and increasing
distributed (consumer‐sited) electricity generation based on combined heat and power.
Recent actions by Governor Crist, the Florida Legislature, and all aspects of state government
demonstrate a strong commitment to exploring opportunities that will reduce energy
consumption and increase renewable energy supply. In 2008, the Legislature passed new
3 ‐3
Chapter 3 – Energy Supply and Demand

______________________________________________________________________________
energy efficiency standards in the statewide building codes. The requirements are to be
incrementally scaled up to provide a 50 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2019,
relative to the 2007 codes. In addition, Florida’s Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act
(FEECA) was enacted in 1980, placing an emphasis on reducing the growth rates of weather‐
sensitive peak demand, reducing and controlling the growth rates of electricity consumption,
and reducing the consumption of scarce resources such as petroleum fuels. The Florida Public
Service Commission (PSC) adopted rules requiring those electric utilities that are subject to
FEECA to implement cost‐effective energy efficiency programs and additional incentives for
increased efficiency gains, as required by the 2008 legislation signed into law by Governor Crist.
Florida has taken a multifaceted approach to reducing barriers to renewable generation and
bringing those technologies to market. For example, the PSC has approved standard offer
contracts to reduce regulatory lag and negotiations between qualifying renewable facilities and
utilities. In 2008, the PSC approved tariffs to implement one of the nation’s most aggressive net‐
metering laws, intended to promote the development and interconnection of customer‐owned
renewable generation, such as solar photovoltaic power. The PSC is developing a rule for a
Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which could encourage utility‐scale renewables. This rule
will be presented to the Legislature in 2009.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (Action Team) recommends a set
of 19 policies for the ESD sector, offering the potential for significant GHG emission reductions.
A summary of the ESD recommendations developed is shown in Table 3‐1. Policies were
grouped into “Tier 1” and “Tier 2” in order to focus the resources for analyzing these
opportunities. Criteria for the tiers were based on the following:
•

Tier 1 – recommendations which were expected to lead to significant GHG reductions by
2025 and were relatively straightforward to analyze (information readily available,
similar policies had been implemented elsewhere).

•

Tier 2 – policies that did not meet the criteria for Tier 1.

The Action Team noted the importance of all of the ESD policies, including both Tier 1 and Tier
2, but chose to focus quantitative analysis and subsequent recommendations (as described
below) on the Tier 1 recommendations. (More information on Tier 2 options can be found in
Appendix A.) Table 3‐1 also includes estimated GHG reductions of recent policy actions that
have been implemented by Florida. Many of Florida’s recent policy actions are included in the
reference case forecast. Changes to the building code, however, were quite recent, and since the
impacts of those changes are not reflected in the forecast, they have been estimated for the
Action Team, with the results of the analysis presented below.

The Action Team noted the importance of all options but the
focus for analysis and subsequent recommendations was on
Tier 1 policies.

GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; $/tCO2e = dollars per metric ton
of carbon dioxide equivalent; HB = House Bill.
Note: The numbering used to denote the above pending priority policies are for reference purposes only; it does not
reflect prioritization among these important policies.
Note 2: Negative numbers in the “Net Present Value” column denote recommendations for which the discounted
value of the monetary benefits of the recommendation are greater than the discounted total costs of the policy.
Note 3: The emissions reduction and cost estimates shown for each individual recommendation presume that each
policy is implemented alone. Many recommendations interact extensively, as they target the reduction of energy use
or emissions from the same sources. Therefore, if multiple recommendations are implemented, the results will not
simply be the sum of each individual recommendation result. After individual recommendation assessments were
complete, a “combined policies” assessment was conducted to estimate total emission reductions, and to capture the
overlaps among policies that are reported here.

These Tier 1 recommendations include efforts to increase the use of renewable and waste‐based
resources for generating electricity (ESD‐5, ESD‐11), increase the use of nuclear power (ESD‐6),
improve the energy and GHG emissions performance of buildings, power plants and other
activities (ESD‐9, ESD‐12, ESD‐13a, ESD‐14), and increase the penetration of combined heat and
power systems (ESD‐8). All of these recommendations have been quantitatively analyzed, and
the estimates prepared suggest that the recommendations can provide substantial reductions in
3 ‐7
Chapter 3 – Energy Supply and Demand

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
GHG emissions. Other Tier 1 recommendations include support for electric power planning
requirements (Integrated Resource Planning, ESD‐7) that directly considers attributes such as
GHG emissions, Training and Education for Building Operators and Community Association
Managers (ESD‐15), Consumer Education Programs (ESD‐17), and a regulatory policy
recommendation (Decoupling, ESD‐23) designed to reduce disincentives for investor‐owned
utilities to increase customers’ energy efficiency. These recommendations are crucial policies
that support the ESD recommendations and have been quantitatively analyzed, but have not
been analyzed individually.
The ESD recommendations yield an annual GHG emissions reduction, from reference case
projections, of 92 MMtCO2e in 2025, and cumulative reductions of 708 MMtCO2e from 2009
through 2025, at a net cost of approximately ‐$16 billion through the year 2025 on a Net Present
Value (NPV) basis. This result accounts for overlaps between recommendations and for the
cumulative changes that the electricity savings (through efficiency) and generation, provided by
the recommendations, will have on the patterns of electricity demand and supply in Florida.
The weighted‐average cost of saved carbon for the combination of all ESD recommendations
evaluated is ‐$23/tCO2e avoided. The negative costs indicate that, over time, the savings from
the recommendations (from energy efficiency and/or avoided use of fossil fuels) will exceed the
costs of implementation.
The Action Team also analyzed the estimated impact of Florida’s recent changes to its building
code, as described above, which is expected to result in substantial GHG emission reductions of
about 15 MMtCO2e in 2025, and cumulative reductions of about 136 MMtCO2e through 2025.
The net cost is approximately –$4 billion through the year 2025 on an NPV basis.

Energy Supply and Demand (ESD)
Policy Descriptions for Tier 1 Recommendations

Tier 1 recommendations are described briefly below. More information on each of these
recommendations, plus the Tier 2 options, can be found in Appendix A.

ESD-5. Promoting Renewable Electricity Generation through Renewable Portfolio
Standard (RPS), Incentives and Barrier Removal

The fundamental policy objectives of encouraging renewable electricity generation are to reduce
GHG emissions, provide fuel diversity, provide more energy security, and stimulate Florida’s
economy. A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) sets the minimum amount of electricity from
renewable sources that must be generated and supplied to the electricity grid in a given year.

3 ‐8
Chapter 3 – Energy Supply and Demand

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
This minimum requirement is applied to each utility, but provisions are often made for utilities
to purchase renewable electricity or credits from other utilities.
Institutional and market barriers to the development of renewable energy include price
distortions, failure of the market to value the public benefits of renewables, the social cost of
fossil fuel technologies, inadequate information, institutional barriers to grid interconnection,
high transaction costs due to small project size, high financing costs because of lender
unfamiliarity, and perceived risk. Developing renewable energy incentives and removing
market barriers can complement an RPS policy tool.
The PSC is currently engaged in rulemaking for a RPS in Florida. This rule must be presented to
the Legislature in its 2009 Session for its consideration and ultimate ratification. The Action
Team recommends that the policy require 20 percent of retail electricity sales be met by
renewable energy by 2020.

ESD-6. Nuclear Power

Nuclear power has historically presented a low‐GHG source of electricity. No new commercial
reactor has come on line in the United States since 1996 due to a combination of high capital
costs, the absence of an operational system for permanent disposal of nuclear waste, and
perceived risks to public safety. The administration of President George W. Bush has been
supportive of nuclear expansion, emphasizing its importance in maintaining a diverse energy
supply and its reputation for producing electricity with negligible greenhouse gas emissions
during operation. Congress also has offered significant financial subsidies for new nuclear
plants in an effort to jump‐start the industry, including limitations on liability for nuclear
accidents.
As of 2006, nuclear power plants provided about 20 percent of electric power nationally and 14
percent of Florida’s generation. The goal for this policy is the installation of two additional
(relative to the reference case) reactors/units of 1,100 MW each in 2020. The reference case
forecast for the electricity sector assumes the installation of the facilities and capacities that are
currently planned and permitted in Florida, including a total of four 1,100 MW reactor units at
the Turkey Point and Levy sites. The Action Team also recommends vigorous efforts in Florida
and across the nation to continue to improve safety standards for nuclear waste material
including management, security, transmittal, long‐term storage, and reprocessing of spent
nuclear material.

______________________________________________________________________________

ESD-7. Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)

Integrated Resource Planning (IRP), as it relates to electric utilities, is an economic planning
process designed to identify the lowest practical cost at which a utility can deliver reliable
energy services to its customers. It differs from traditional resource planning (the 10‐Year
Planning process currently used in Florida), in that it requires the use of analytical tools that
assess and compare the costs and benefits of demand and supply‐side energy resources. IRP
should help to identify and standardize the critical assumptions across each of the varied
planning forums that drive utility resource decisions, while building in flexibility to account for
future uncertainties. While originally targeted primarily toward cost‐minimization, IRP
processes increasingly have considered the environmental risks and the potential costs and
benefits associated with future GHG regulations.
This recommendation calls on Florida to undertake an integrated resource planning regime that
embraces the idea of “least cost‐best fit” as its primary criterion. Depending on its design, the
IRP regime in Florida could be a means of implementing many of the other ESD
recommendations.

ESD-8. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems

Combined heat and power (CHP) is generally considered to refer to the use of a heat engine or a
power station to simultaneously generate electricity and useful heat. CHP systems reduce fossil
fuel use and GHG emissions through the improved efficiency of the CHP systems, relative to
separate heat and power technologies, and by avoiding transmission and distribution losses
associated with moving power from central power stations located far away from where the
electricity is used. For this policy, CHP is defined broadly to include large‐scale projects for heat
and waste heat recovery. Also, it is intended to include the potential capture of all sources of
byproduct heat generation, including waste heat from exothermic reactions when sulfuric acid
is produced (such as is generated in phosphate fertilizer manufacturing).
The Action Team recommends that this policy be implemented by providing financial
incentives and addressing the numerous barriers to development of CHP systems, including:
inadequate technical information; institutional barriers; high transaction costs due to small
project size; lender unfamiliarity and perceived risk; “split incentives” between building owners
and tenants; and utility‐related policies, such as interconnection requirements, high standby
rates, and exit fees.

______________________________________________________________________________

ESD-9. Power Plant Efficiency Improvements

Efficiency improvements refer to increasing generation efficiency at power stations through
incremental improvements at existing plants (for example, more efficient boilers and turbines,
improved control systems, or the use of combined cycle technology) and/or repowering.
Repowering existing plants refers to switching to lower‐ or zero‐emitting fuels at existing plants
or for new capacity additions. This includes use of biomass or natural gas in place of coal or oil,
thus reducing emissions rates at existing plants.
The Action Team recommends consideration of a range of policies that would encourage
efficiency improvements and repowering of existing plants by including incentives or
regulations as described in other recommendations and offering additional financing
opportunities for those efficiency improvements.

ESD-11. Landfill Gas-to-Energy

The capture of methane gas from landfills provides an opportunity to reduce direct emissions of
methane from landfills and to produce electricity. Added policy benefits of landfill gas power
plants include producing base load‐like electric generation, and offering the opportunity for
combined heat and power to serve nearby thermal loads.
The Action Team recommends consideration of the expansion of landfill gas‐to‐energy in
Florida either through a mandate or an incentive program.

ESD-12. Demand-Side Management (DSM)/Energy Efficiency Programs,
Funds, or Goals for Electricity

Demand Side Management (DSM)/energy efficiency programs, and funds or goals for electricity
entail actions that influence the quantity and/or patterns of use of energy consumed by end
users. For this recommendation, DSM refers to programs implemented by utilities with the
objective of reducing electricity consumption. Historically, Florida DSM programs have focused
more on peak‐power demand savings than on electrical energy savings; thus, this
recommendation represents a shift in the objectives, and therefore the application, of DSM by
Florida utilities.
This recommendation focuses on increasing investment in electricity efficiency through
programs run by utilities or others, energy efficiency funds, and energy efficiency goals. These
3 ‐11
Chapter 3 – Energy Supply and Demand

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
programs may be designed to work in tandem with other strategies that encourage efficiency
gains. The policy design includes two key and linked dimensions: achievable/desirable energy
savings and policy/administrative mechanisms to achieve these savings.
The Action Team recommends consideration of a range of policy and administrative
mechanisms that might be applied include: regulator‐verified savings targets; public benefit
charges; portfolio standards; “energy trusts”; IRP as noted above; performance‐based
incentives; decoupling of rates and revenues; and appropriate rate treatment for efficiency.
Potential mechanisms include revisions of existing statutes to enable utility investments in
energy efficiency at the levels indicated above, and consideration of eligible programs that are
cost‐effective, taking into account the valuation of carbon dioxide emissions.

ESD-13a. Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings

With more than 50 percent of electricity in Florida used in residences, focusing attention on
energy efficiency improvements to existing home structures has the potential to provide
substantial reductions in electricity usage and associated GHG emissions.
The Action Team recommends consideration of a range of measures, including: incentives that
focus on existing residential buildings, including low‐ or zero‐interest energy efficiency loans;
rewards for alternative business models aimed at delivering energy efficiency services; usage of
energy performance benchmarks for buildings and incentives for exceeding the benchmarks;
and health and safety standards that complement energy efficiency features.

ESD-14. Improved Building Codes for Energy Efficiency

Buildings are significant consumers of energy and other resources. Building energy codes can
be an effective way to ensure that the most energy‐efficient practices are incorporated into new
or renovated buildings. This policy sets a goal for reducing building energy consumption to be
achieved by increasing standards for the minimum performance of new and substantially
renovated commercial and residential buildings through the adoption and enforcement of
building codes. Building codes would be made more stringent via incorporation of aspects of
advanced or next‐generation building designs and construction standards, such as sustainable
design and green building standards.
House Bills 697 and 7135 signed into law by Governor Crist in 2008 call for the energy efficiency
requirements of the Florida Energy Efficiency Code to be incrementally scaled up to 50 percent
higher than the 2007 code by 2019. The Action Team recommends that the scale‐up of energy

3 ‐12

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
efficiency requirements from House Bill 697 and House Bill 7135 be made to continue beyond
2019.

ESD-15. Training and Education for Building Operators and
Community Association Managers

Energy Management Training provides administrative and technical training for energy
managers, school officials, building operators, and others responsible for energy‐efficient
facility operation. The Action Team recommends the following:

•

Train commercial building energy managers, for example, by making use of the building
operator training and certification program developed in the Pacific Northwest;

•

Train industrial energy and facility managers in techniques for improving the efficiency of
their steam, process heat, pumping, compressed air, motors, and other systems, perhaps in
collaboration with ongoing U.S. Department of Energy programs in this area; and

•

Create a credentialing program for certification of “green” energy managers that requires
both training and examinations to qualify.

ESD-17. Consumer Education Programs

In many cases, the ultimate effectiveness of emissions reduction activities depends on providing
information and education to consumers regarding the energy usage and resulting GHG
emissions implications of their choices. Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a
broad awareness of climate change issues and effects (including co‐benefits, such as clean air
and public health) among the state’s citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in
actions to reduce GHG emissions in their personal and professional lives. Public education and
outreach efforts should integrate and build on existing outreach efforts involving climate
change and related issues in the state. Ultimately, public education and outreach will be the
foundation for the long‐term success of all of the mitigation actions proposed by the Action
Team, as well as those that may evolve in the future from other entities. The Action Team
recommends the following measures:

•

Institute mandatory labeling programs for time‐of‐sale energy use for all consumer
products, devices, and systems (including all buildings) that can be evaluated by either
testing or computer simulation, and educate consumers on the implications of these labels.

•

Create a public inquiry “information center” to provide factual answers (vetted by experts
in the field) to common energy‐efficiency and GHG questions.
3 ‐13

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Provide public education materials and energy information that can be used at local levels
by minimally trained speakers.

•

Create an awards program that recognizes businesses and individuals exhibiting exemplary
behavior or performance with respect to local energy and climate public education
programs or in local GHG or energy use reduction programs.

•

Provide Public Service Announcement (PSA) programs.

ESD-23. Decoupling

Traditional regulatory frameworks tie a utility’s recovery of fixed costs of providing service (for
example, infrastructure costs) to the quantity of energy sold. As a result, there is a contrary
“incentive” for utilities to increase sales in order to boost revenues and minimize investments in
energy efficiency (which would lead to lower sales). This recommendation includes the
implementation of cost recovery rules that “decouple” the level of utility sales from net
revenues earned by investor‐owned utilities. Decoupling should be geared exclusively to
remove barriers to utility investment in programs to increase customer energy efficiency and
reduce customer loads. Decoupling mechanisms should be carefully designed in order to avoid,
as much as possible, adverse economic impacts on ratepayers and to ensure that the decoupling
mechanism is fair to both consumers and shareholders.
HB 7135 directed the PSC to analyze utility revenue “decoupling” and to provide a report and
recommendation to the Governor, President of the Senate, and Speaker of the House of
Representatives by 2009. The PSC began its workshops on this topic in August 2008.

Chapter 4
Cap‐and‐Trade
Overview
A cap‐and‐trade system works by setting an overall limit on emissions and either selling or
distributing, at no cost, emissions “allowances,” or permits to emit pollutants, to regulated
entities or sources. These regulated entities must periodically surrender enough allowances to
match their reported emissions or face a penalty. In a system that freely grants allowances,
those sources that are able to reduce their emissions at a lower cost than the allowance price
may do so and then sell those unused allowances to any entity that cannot achieve reductions as
cost‐effectively. In a system where allowances are initially sold, cost‐effective emissions
reductions reduce the number of allowances that must be purchased. Either way, cap‐and‐trade
creates a financial incentive for emitters to continually seek out new emission‐reducing
technologies and cut emissions as much as possible. By creating a market for the allowances,
regulated entities have the choice of either purchasing allowances or directly reducing
emissions; as a result, resources are directed to the most cost‐effective emissions reduction
investments. To achieve overall emissions reductions over time, programs gradually lower the
emissions “cap” by reducing the total number of available allowances.
Perhaps the best known example of cap‐and‐trade is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) program to cut acid rain‐causing sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants.
Established under the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, this program successfully demonstrated
the emissions trading concept by achieving dramatic, cost‐effective reductions. More recently,
the trading approach has been applied to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the European
Union (EU)1 and proposed by several U.S.‐based initiatives, including the Northeast Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),2 the Western Climate Initiative (WCI),3 and the Midwestern
Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord.4
The Action Team is charged with identifying means by which Florida can fully achieve or
surpass the statewide GHG reductions specified in Executive Order 07‐127.5 These
recommendations must be guided by an evaluation of the possible consequences to Florida’s
environment, economy, and society from global climate change. In November 2007, the Action
Team issued its Phase 1 Report. The report offered broad policy guidance in key areas for
consideration by the Governor and Legislature or further consideration by the Action Team,
including a market‐based regulatory approach for utility emissions.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
In June 2008, Governor Crist signed House Bill 7135 (HB 7135), a comprehensive energy and
climate change package aimed at reducing GHG emissions that included public investment and
private‐market incentives in alternative and renewable energy technologies. Section 65 of HB
7135 required the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to propose rules for
the creation of a cap‐and‐trade regulatory program. This chapter presents the results of the
Phase 2 consideration called for in the Phase 1 Report and offers pre‐rulemaking guidance to
the DEP in response to the requirements of HB 7135.
There is growing expectation that Congress will require a federal cap‐and‐trade program. By
initiating, joining, or developing a state and/or regional cap‐and‐trade system in the meantime,
Florida would be taking an important step toward influencing the outcome of the federal policy
debate in the state’s favor.
Ultimately the pollution‐cutting performance of a cap‐and‐trade program depends largely on
how it is structured. Key design parameters are discussed below.
The cap‐and‐trade policy is designed and analyzed to work in concert with non‐cap‐and‐trade
policies and measures. The integration of other policies reduces compliance costs and eases
attainment of both goals and caps. Emissions reductions, costs, and cost‐savings from many of
these other measures help Florida comply with the cap; and they also serve as a basis for the
cap‐and‐trade modeling. As a result, the expected operation of the cap‐and‐trade program is
integrated with other policies and policy recommendations, and is not presented as a stand‐
alone program.

______________________________________________________________________________

Sector Coverage
The regulation of GHG emissions should be economy‐wide and should commence as soon as
possible; however, a cap‐and‐trade program may apply only to a limited number of sectors.
Sector inclusion in the cap‐and‐trade program should be guided by cost‐effectiveness,
administrative efficiency, overall reduction potential, experience by other jurisdictions, and
whether alternative policies are preferred. The Florida cap‐and‐trade program should include
the electric sector at the beginning. Rulemaking consideration also should be given to:
(1) industrial stationary source emissions;
(2) residential and commercial fuel use;
(3) transportation fuels; and
(4) energy extraction, processing, and transportation.
These sectors may be better candidates for inclusion in a subsequent phase.
The transportation and residential and commercial fuel use sectors could be considered through
rulemaking. They have not been included in cap‐and‐trade programs to date, although WCI has
proposed to include them in its program beginning in 2015. Unlike the electricity, energy
extraction, and industrial sectors, these two sectors would most likely have to be regulated
upstream of the actual point of emissions. The regulated entity in the transportation and
residential and commercial fuel use sectors may need to be the fuel distributor or importer.
Transportation and residential and commercial fuel use should be studied further and
considered for inclusion in a subsequent phase, or they may be better suited for regulation
through non‐cap‐and‐trade market mechanisms. While these and other sectors may not be
included in the cap‐and‐trade program or otherwise regulated at the program start, they should
be included or otherwise regulated as soon as possible.
Other sectors may need alternative methods of regulation based on the factors listed above.
Land development, forestry, agriculture, and waste management are generally not regulated
under a cap‐and‐trade program due to a lack of historical emissions data, difficulty measuring
or verifying current emissions, and other reasons. Emissions reduction projects or programs
within these sectors may, however, be well‐suited to participate in an “offsets” program as
described below.
The Action Team recommends that a de minimis exemption below, which sources within the
regulated sectors, would be exempt from regulation. The threshold for the exemption could
vary by sector.

______________________________________________________________________________

Regional Programs
First and foremost, a strong national cap‐and‐trade program is the preferred method for
achieving substantial reductions in GHGs, and Florida should advocate for a national program.
However, as the federal government deliberates on a national program, Florida should join a
regional program to advance its GHG reduction goals. Toward that end, Florida should further
examine the economics of joining a regional program, but should not join a regional program
where analysis indicates that Florida would be disadvantaged.
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) – Initial analysis indicates that Florida would
benefit from joining RGGI. RGGI currently comprises 10 northeastern states and will regulate
emissions from fossil fuel–powered electric generation units (EGUs) with a nameplate capacity
of 25 megawatts (MW) or greater. Two 100 percent auction‐based cap‐and‐trade scenarios for
year 2020 are simulated for Florida joining the RGGI program.6 The two scenarios correspond to
hypothetical allowance prices of $7/tCO2e and $1/tCO2e, respectively. Preliminary modeling
indicates that Florida sources would represent slightly less than half of the total electric
generation emissions from the 11 states (10 current states plus Florida), and, depending on
assumptions used, would mitigate between 70 and 76 MMtCO2e in 2020, with the balance of 75
to 80 MMtCO2e accounted for by allowance purchases. Florida’s RGGI sources would expect to
see a cost‐savings of between $1.5 and $2 billion dollars in 2020 by participating. (Note that any
additional savings that might be realized from the recycling of the auction revenues by the
government are not included.) Complete modeling results and analysis may be found in
Appendix B: Cap‐and‐Trade. The Action Team recommends that Florida seek “observer status”
with RGGI as soon as possible to examine the program in greater detail, closely monitor
progress, and prepare for membership if it is desired.
Western Climate Initiative (WCI) – Initial analysis indicates that Florida may benefit from
joining the cap‐and‐trade portion of WCI. Further study would be necessary to determine
whether participation in the other planned WCI programs (regional low‐carbon fuel standard
and renewable portfolio standard) would benefit Florida. WCI is currently comprised of seven
U.S. states and four Canadian provinces; its proposed cap‐and‐trade program will cover
emissions from multiple sectors representing approximately 90 percent of total regional
emissions. The cap‐and‐trade simulation for Florida joining WCI (based on the WCI proposed
program design recommendations released September 23, 2008), covers a much broader range
of emission sources than the RGGI simulation (basically all the sectors except the agriculture,
forestry, and waste management sectors). The analysis indicates that Florida would be a permit
seller in the market. Florida WCI sources would expect to see a cost savings of $191 million in
2020 by participating in the cap‐and‐trade program as opposed to achieving the same
reductions without it. Florida sources would be expected to mitigate 18.46 MMtCO2e more than
required to meet targets due to the relatively low cost of mitigation and the opportunity to sell
A 100 percent auction is assumed due to limitations in the model resulting from RGGI’s low cost mitigation
opportunities (see Annex 1 to Appendix B). As a policy matter, the Action Team is neither recommending nor
assuming that Florida will use 100‐percent auctions as a means of initially distributing allowances.

allowances to other WCI sources. Complete modeling results and analysis are found in
Appendix B: Cap‐and‐Trade. Because WCI is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2012, at the
earliest, there is ample opportunity to conduct further economic analysis and possibly observe
the early operation of WCI.
The Action Team recommends that Florida seek “observer status” with WCI as soon as possible
to examine the program in greater detail, closely monitor progress, and prepare for membership
if desired.
These two regional programs may not be mutually exclusive. The Action Team further
recommends that Florida explore the economics and potential obstacles, complications, and
benefits associated with joining both regional programs.
Other programs – Six Midwestern states and Manitoba are currently engaged in a discussion
toward the development of a third regional cap‐and‐trade program. Recently organized, the
group expects to release a draft program design in November 2008, so the Action Team was
unable to evaluate whether Florida might benefit. Florida should continue to monitor the
progress of this program and investigate the Midwestern program as it develops.
At the same time, Florida should reach out to other Southern states to explore collaborating in
one or more ways: (1) jointly influence the development of a national cap‐and‐trade program;
(2) explore the potential for multiple Southern states joining one or more regional programs; (3)
help address “leakage” issues (see page 4‐9); and (4) explore the creation of a Southern regional
climate initiative to reduce GHG emissions, stimulate the development of renewable energy
sources, reduce dependence on imported fuels, and stimulate the creation of industries
specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon mitigation technologies.
Finally, the Action Team strongly recommends that Florida not pursue a “one state” cap‐and‐
trade program.

Caps and Goals
Florida’s GHG reduction cap‐and‐trade program should be designed to achieve the emission
reduction goals set forth in Executive Order 07‐127. However, as directed in that Executive
Order and the recently enacted HB 7135, Florida should evaluate the conditions under which
the state could cost‐effectively link its trading system to the systems of other states or regions,
such as RGGI or WCI. If Florida joins a regional climate initiative, it should accept the regional
goal as long as it is consistent with the state’s GHG reduction goals. Current modeling indicates
that RGGI should bring Florida’s electric sector emissions to the state’s goals; however, if it does
not, additional policies and measures would be required to reduce GHG emissions to meet the
state’s goals.

Flexibility and Cost Containment Mechanisms
The mechanisms described below contain a brief description followed by the policy
recommendation.

•

Offsets— Regulated sources can comply with the cap‐and‐trade program in three ways:
reduce emissions directly; acquire and surrender allowances sufficient to cover emissions; or
invest in qualifying offset projects and surrender offset credits. Offset projects are voluntary
and generate revenue for a project owner through the sale of offset credits, which are
equivalent to government‐issued allowances. Emission reductions from regulated sources
are, therefore, not eligible as offset projects; otherwise these reductions would be double‐
counted (once for the benefit of the regulated source under the cap, and again for the benefit
of the offset purchaser). To ensure the integrity of the emissions cap, offset projects should
reduce emissions or sequester carbon from uncapped, out‐of‐sector projects that are
recognized by the program as qualifying for allowance credit. In most cases, any emissions
included under any cap‐and‐trade program’s cap cannot be reduced and also qualify as an
offset credit under any other cap‐and‐trade program. Offsets provide an incentive for low‐
cost investments in uncapped emission reductions as an alternative to higher‐cost, in‐sector
reductions, or allowance purchases.
Recommendation: The cap‐and‐trade program should allow offsets without limits; however, the offset
program must ensure rigorous quality standards.

•

Safety Valve—A safety valve is a program feature designed to limit or moderate the cost of
allowances for the purpose of ensuring that the program will not have an unacceptable
impact on consumer costs. Safety valves can be as direct and simple as an allowance price
cap, or as indirect and complex as the RGGI’s stepped expansion of offset opportunities
triggered by allowance prices7. The safety valve can be used in conjunction with other tools
to mitigate price volatility (such as banking and borrowing). It should be noted that hitting
the safety valve price cap would effectively convert the cap‐and‐trade program into a
carbon tax at that price.
Recommendation: The cap‐and‐trade program needs appropriate allowance price containment
mechanisms, especially in the early years. Further study is needed before the specific mechanisms can
be recommended.

•

Banking—Banking allows permit holders to withhold unneeded allowances from the
market, or from surrender for emissions compliance, without expiration. A banked
allowance may be used in any compliance period beyond the issuance period without
penalty. Banking is seen as a means of mitigating market volatility by allowing holders to
hold allowances (thereby mitigating supply) when prices are low, and to use or sell them
(thereby mitigating demand) when prices are high.

7

The Western Climate Initiative employs banking, offsets and three-year compliance periods to mitigate allowance
prices but does not have a “safety valve.”

4‐6
Chapter 4 – Cap‐and‐Trade

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Recommendation: The cap‐and‐trade program should allow unlimited banking.

•

Borrowing—Borrowing of allowances permits emitters to release excess tons of GHGs in the
current compliance period in return for greater reductions in a future compliance period.
Recommendation: Borrowing is an important cost containment mechanism and should be allowed,
but agreement by the Action Team was not reached on what conditions (e.g., Warner‐Lieberman‐type
limits by emitter, time limits, or interest) should be imposed.

Allowance Distribution
One of the most difficult issues confronting cap‐and‐trade program designers is how allowances
are initially introduced to the market. The two principal methods are free allocation and auction
sale. Free allocation is the method used in the EPA SO2 trading program and was widely used in
the first two phases of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) program. Meantime, RGGI will
auction nearly all of its allowances, and the EU is gradually moving toward greater reliance on
auctions.8 WCI is still deliberating on the issue, although it is likely that a decision on how best
to distribute allowances will ultimately rest with participating jurisdictions.
Under a free allocation system, jurisdictions distribute allowances free of charge to regulated
entities according to a formula based upon historical emissions, benchmarked emissions (the
expected emissions per unit output for a facility with a preferred technological configuration),
or on some other basis. Free allocation systems may include equity features such as a “reserve”
for new market entrants, to avoid creating a competitive disadvantage. The formula that
determines the number of allowances allocated to each source can be challenging to create.
Historical emissions are a common approach, but issues such as selecting the time period to use
as a basis and various equity adjustments can be difficult to determine. Benchmarking is
straightforward in principle but very difficult to achieve in practice.
Under an auction system, allowances are presented to the market by sale at auction. Regulated
entities are therefore required to purchase allowances. Revenues are collected by the issuing
jurisdiction. Auctioning allowances resolves the “allocation basis” and many equity issues
arising from the free allocation method but presents a new set of challenges, including the
additional cost imposed on regulated entities and consumers. Emitters in some sectors are able
to pass these costs on to their customers, but others are not. The cost passed along to the
consumer may be a public policy concern and, in cases where competitive pressure prevents
this, the economic impact on the emitter might be a concern. However, these concerns can be
addressed by designing the program to be revenue neutral and returning the allowance value
from the auction to consumers directly or through programs implemented for their benefit. In
addition, there is the question of what the issuing jurisdiction will do with the auction revenues.

8

On September 25, 2008, RGGI held its first auction, where 100 percent of its allowances were successfully
auctioned off at a price of $3.07.

4‐7
Chapter 4 – Cap‐and‐Trade

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
In the free allocation system, there is a concern regarding windfall profits, as happened in some
instances in the EU. This can be an issue when the emitter is not price‐regulated and can pass
along the cost to customers, as can occur with generators in most of the RGGI states. However,
in states where generators are price‐regulated, such as Florida, through the Public Service
Commission rate hearings, the value of the freely allocated allowance can be directed to the
benefit of the ratepayer through rate‐setting.
Free allocation and auctioning are not mutually exclusive. Programs can distribute some
percentage of allowances using one method and then balance with the other. Programs may
change the ratio of free allocation to auction distribution over time. Programs also may
distribute allowances to different regulated sectors using different methods or a different mix of
methods. Programs may even distribute allowances differently among different classes of
sources within a sector (whether municipality‐owned utilities, cooperative utilities, or investor‐
owned utilities).
The Action Team was unable to reach a consensus recommendation on the central issue of
initial allowance distribution method. By a 13‐5 majority, 9 the Action Team recommends that
strong consideration be given to auctioning a substantial amount of allowances. The Action
Team recognizes that as RGGI and WCI evolve, additional information will become available to
DEP and the Legislature to better evaluate the use of auctions at the beginning of the cap‐and‐
trade program and over time.
Those Action Team members who were opposed to this recommendation expressed concern
that there has been no Florida‐specific analysis of the relative cost to the consumer for
allowance distribution by either auction or free‐of‐charge allocation. Without such information,
they argue, any recommendation stating a preference would be premature. Concerns included
whether requiring some industries to pay for allowances would put them at a competitive
disadvantage. Others were concerned that there was no assurance that revenues from the sale of
allowances would be used by the state for related purposes such as those stated below.
Those who supported auctioning pointed out that presentations from representatives of RGGI
and the EU ETS had recommended the use of auctioning. Others stated that the revenues
generated by the auctions would be needed to finance other key policies and measures
proposed by the Action Team. At least one member observed that given the differences among
electric utilities in the state, there would be no fair way to allocate allowances among them. The
member observed that the formula would likely be the subject of intense lobbying in the
Legislature, and, if allowances were distributed on the basis of historical emissions, customers
of utilities with historically higher electric rates and cleaner generation would be disadvantaged
while those with lower rates and higher emissions would be advantaged. Supporters of the
position expressed the belief that auctioning is the most fair distribution method.

9

The five Action Team members that voted no on this recommendation were: Mayor Rick Baker, Mike Branch,
Mark Kaplan, Kathleen Shanahan and Kathy E. Viehe.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
By unanimous consent, the Action Team offers the following general recommendations that
could guide future policymakers in answering the question of allowance distribution:
Any allowance distribution system needs to be periodically evaluated to determine whether it is
working properly and serving the program goals.
•

The cap‐and‐trade program should strive to be revenue‐neutral to consumers as much
as possible. There are five broad purposes to which allowance value (either the
allowances themselves or proceeds from their sale) should be applied. The purposes are
not in any priority order:
o

Promote energy efficiency investments,

o

Mitigate impacts on ratepayers and consumers with particular attention to low‐
income consumers,

o

Accelerate the development and use of emissions mitigation technologies,
including renewable or zero‐carbon technologies,

o

Mitigate impacts of climate change (for example, fund adaptation strategies), and

o

Protect regulated emitters from competitive disadvantage.

There are a number of other important uses of allowance value which should also be
considered, such as stimulating or rewarding investment in carbon emissions abatement
technologies, funding program administration, and protecting regulated emitters from
economic disadvantage. One member felt strongly that all allowance value should be used to
mitigate the program’s impact on ratepayers and consumers.
It is the Action Team’s strong recommendation that if any revenues are generated from the sale of
allowances, they should never be used to supplement General Revenue to the State of Florida.

Reporting
The cap‐and‐trade reporting system should be consistent with any national requirement. Every
effort should be made to ensure that regulated entities are required to complete only one report
for both state and national efforts. The reporting system should be as broad as possible; a de
minimis limit may be needed, given administrative and cost concerns.
Mandatory reporting of GHG emissions is legislatively required at both the state and federal
levels. Adoption of reporting rules and collection of emissions data should proceed as quickly
as possible in advance of the cap‐and‐trade program. This is necessary to verify the data from
sources and sectors where the historical lack of such requirements injects a significant level of
uncertainty into historical emissions estimates and future projections.

Leakage
Leakage occurs when, in response to program incentives, utilities choose to either increase out‐
of region fossil‐based power purchases, or investors choose to construct new generation units in
unregulated border jurisdictions. In either case, both the environmental benefits and in‐state
investment are lost. It is noted that in a national program, leakage is not an issue. Leakage can
be addressed through careful design of the point‐of‐regulation, as in the First Jurisdiction
Deliverer (FJD) plan in WCI. FJD requires compliance from any generator within the region,
plus any entity that imports fossil‐based power from outside the WCI region.10
Historically, between 1990 and 2005, electricity imports have contributed between 9 percent and
16 percent of total electricity consumption in Florida. Accordingly, it is critical that the cap‐and‐
trade program baseline include these out‐of‐state sources and their respective changes over
time to accurately define the reduction requirements under the current generation mix.
The Action Team believes leakage is a potentially serious concern. Based on the initial analysis,
projected 2020 “business as usual” GHG emissions from imports represent 10 percent of total
electricity emissions, or 19.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e). This
amount is equal to about one‐third of the total electric utility sector emissions reductions
required by 2020 to meet the Governor’s GHG reduction goals. Further, electricity imports and
their associated GHG emissions are expected to increase if Florida’s electricity generation sector
is subject to a carbon cap and if generation in adjacent states was not subject to a similar
requirement.
The Action Team recommends that leakage must be addressed by any cap‐and‐trade program or by
Florida through other means if a regional cap‐and‐trade program does not do so.

Trial Period
The first recommendation in Regional Programs is that there should be a strong federal cap‐
and‐trade program and that Florida should be an advocate for national action. It is
recommended that a new national program should incorporate a trial period to facilitate the
transition, verify data, and sort out administrative and other details. The trial period should
afford greater flexibility to the regulated community than would be otherwise allowed, but it
should nonetheless impose enforceable, binding compliance obligations on regulated sources.
The second recommendation under Regional Programs is that Florida should join one or more
regional programs. The issue of a trial period in these cases is a matter of regional agreement.
Florida should support the trial period requirements of any regional program it might seek to
join.

RGGI does not address the issue of leakage within the program design. RGGI recognizes the issue and will monitor
inter‐regional contracts and purchases to assess whether leakage is occurring. RGGI has indicated that if leakage
proves to be a serious issue, action will be taken to address it.

Transportation and Land Use Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector is the second‐largest contributor to Florida’s gross greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. In 2005, the sector accounted for 36 percent, or about 122 million metric tons
of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e), of Florida’s gross GHG emissions. Emissions from the
sector increased by 34 MMtCO2e between 1990 and 2005. Transportation’s share of total GHG
emissions has increased slightly over this period, accounting for about 41 percent of the state’s
net growth in gross GHG emissions.
Figure 5‐1 and Table 5‐1 show historic and projected transportation GHG emissions by fuel and
source. As shown in the figure and table, on‐road gasoline vehicles account for the largest share
of transportation emissions—about 63 percent in 2005. On‐road diesel vehicles account for
another 15 percent of emissions, and marine vessels account for roughly 12 percent. Air travel,
rail, and other sources produce the remaining emissions.

Table 5-1. Historic and Projected Gross GHG Emissions from Transportation (MMtCO2e)

Source: Florida Inventory and Reference Case Projection, October 2008.

As a result of Florida’s population and economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles
traveled (VMT), on‐road gasoline consumption grew by 44 percent between 1990 and 2005.
Meanwhile, on‐road diesel use rose by 88 percent during that period, suggesting an even more
rapid growth in freight movement within or across the state boundaries. In the absence of
significant increases in vehicle fuel economy, on‐road gasoline and diesel emissions are
expected to continue to grow at roughly historical rates through 2025. Total transportation
emissions are projected to grow by 64 percent, or 78 MMtC02e, between 2005 and 2025.
The U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 contains a provision to increase the
corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of light‐duty vehicles (passenger cars and light trucks)
to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The Inventory and Projections report does not include the CAFE
or biofuels provisions (or any other provisions) of the Energy Independence and Security Act of
2007. Increases in vehicle fuel economy resulting from this Act will lead to reduced carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions from on‐road vehicles. The effect of the new CAFE standards was
accounted for in the estimates of GHG reductions from the various Transportation and Land
Use (TLU) sector policy recommendations from the Technical Working Group discussed below.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Florida has substantial opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from transportation sources.
The principal means to reduce GHG emissions in TLU are:
•
•
•

Improving vehicle fuel efficiency;
Substituting gasoline and diesel with lower‐emission fuels; and
Reducing total VMT.
5‐2

Chapter 5 – Transportation and Land Use

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
In Florida and in the nation as a whole, vehicle fuel efficiency has improved little since the late
1980s, yet many studies have documented the potential for substantial increases in efficiency
while maintaining vehicle size and performance. Automobile manufacturers typically oppose
dramatic increases in fuel economy. Key points of contention include the cost to manufacturers
and the cost to consumers. Even with the adoption of the new federal CAFE requirements, there
still may be opportunities for further increases in fuel efficiency while maintaining vehicle size
and performance.
The use of fuels with lower per‐mile GHG emissions could achieve larger market penetration in
Florida. Conventional gasoline‐ and diesel‐fired vehicles can use low‐level blends of biofuels.
Alternative‐technology vehicles can also use higher‐level blends, as well as other types of
alternative fuels, such as natural gas and hydrogen. The type of fuel used is a crucial
determinant of impact on GHG emissions, as some alternative fuels have relatively little GHG
benefit. Alternative fuels from biomass, cellulosic residues, and energy crops have been
identified by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Energy
(US DOE) as the best near‐term opportunity to reduce oil dependence and GHG emissions.
Key determinants of the possible impact to GHG emissions will be the development and
deployment of fuel types. At present, fuel distribution infrastructure is a constraining factor.
Existing federal legislation and the 2006 Florida Energy Act provide incentives in the form of
corporate income tax credits and sales tax credits for investments in the production, storage,
and distribution of biodiesel and ethanol. However, the Florida tax credits “sunset” on June 30,
2010, and are subject to relatively low statewide caps on the amount of credits allowable.
Reducing VMT is crucial to mitigating GHG emissions from the transportation sector.
Developing smarter land‐use and transportation development patterns that reduce trip length
and support transit, ridesharing, biking, and walking can contribute substantially to this goal. A
variety of pricing policies and incentive packages can also help to reduce VMT. Developing
better planning methods and regulations, and increasing funding of multiple modes of
transportation, will be key components in achieving these goals.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Florida Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (Action Team)
recommends a set of seven policies for the TLU sector that offer the potential for major
economic benefits and emission decreases. Implementing these policy recommendations could
lead to emission reductions of:
•
•

12.73 MMtCO2e annual reductions in 2025, and
57.53 MMtCO2e cumulative savings from 2009 through 2025.

The weighted‐average cost of the recommended policies is ‐$86/MtCO2e, for the policies where
cost was quantified. This average value includes policies where individual cost‐effectiveness
ranges from a net savings of about $142/MtCO2e to a cost of $2/MtCO2e. The estimated impacts
of the individual policies are shown in Table 5‐2.
5‐3
Chapter 5 – Transportation and Land Use

www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
The policies recommended by the Action Team are described briefly here and in more detail in
Appendix C of this report. As stated earlier, the recommendations not only could result in
significant GHG emission reductions, but offer a host of additional benefits as well. These
benefits include reduced local air pollution, more livable/healthier communities, and economic
development and job growth from in‐state biofuels production. To yield the levels of savings
described here, the recommended policies need to be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and
thorough manner.
Low‐GHG fuels (TLU‐1) and improved transportation system management (TLU‐4) are
important components of the recommended policies. Transportation fuel providers would need
to undertake changes in their production and distribution methods in order to achieve the goals
set out in TLU‐1. There is feasibility issues associated with transporting large volumes of
biofuels to and within the state, as well as distributing biofuels to consumers. For example,
ethanol has historically not been moved in the pipeline network used to transport gasoline and
diesel fuel. The pipeline industry is currently in the process of adapting technology for pipeline
distribution of ethanol. To achieve the goals of TLU‐1, the challenges of production and
distribution of low‐GHG fuels will need to be addressed through this and other means.
TLU‐4, taken in concert with other aggressive transportation and land use policy actions, could
result in significant reductions to VMT on the order of 7‐10 percent in urban areas by 2020.
Vehicle hours of travel (VHT) can be reduced by amounts that are associated with these VMT
reductions. VHT reduction is recognized as a means of reducing driver delay while reducing
fuel consumption in congested traffic.
Several other policies would work with TLU‐4, and with each other, to further reduce VMT by
increasing the viability of multiple modes of travel and providing incentives to use modes other
than single‐occupant vehicles (SOVs); these are Smart Growth Planning (TLU‐3), and Increasing
Choices in Modes of Transportation and Factoring GHG Emissions into TLU Planning Processes
(TLU‐5 & 6). Smart‐growth policies are being considered and implemented around the country
in a wide range of communities. Because most policies are deregulatory in nature, this
significantly lowers political barriers. However, these policies will face several challenges. They
require closer coordination between state government, local government, and businesses in
many cases. The availability of funding for the provision of additional transit services is
uncertain. Also, patterns of development are subject to economic cycles and many private
investment decisions. Yet implementation of these policies is essential to make travel by
walking, biking, and transit more feasible. Together these policies address the built
environment, transportation infrastructure, and the behavior of individuals to reduce per capita
VMT.

Florida is currently pursuing adoption of the California Clean Car standards which would
increase fuel economy standards beyond those set by the new Federal CAFE standards. Because
these standards are a part of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)
rulemaking process, they are not included as one of the TLU policy recommendations. The
Clean Car standards must clear several hurdles before Florida or any other state can adopt
them, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approval of the original
California Clean Car standards (that other states can then opt into). If for any reason the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is not able to implement the Clean Car
standards, other technology‐based policy recommendations could play a larger role. For
example, Incentive Programs for Increased Vehicle Fleet Efficiency (TLU‐7) encourages

consumers to buy the most efficient vehicles available on the market. Low Rolling Resistance
Tires and Other Add‐On Technologies (TLU‐2) can improve vehicle fuel economy through
vehicle operation and maintenance practices. Other policies, such as Increasing Freight
Movement Efficiencies (TLU‐8), can promote technological improvements in the heavy‐duty
vehicle fleet.

Transportation and Land Use Policy Descriptions

The policy recommendations described briefly here could not only result in significant GHG
emission reductions and cost savings but also offer a host of additional benefits, such as
reduced local air pollution; more livable/healthier communities; and increased transportation
choices. Appendix C of this report discusses these policies in more detail.

TLU-1.

Develop and Expand Low-GHG Fuels

This recommendation seeks to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the carbon intensity of
vehicle fuels sold in Florida. A low‐carbon fuel standard would require all fuel providers in
Florida to ensure that the mix of fuel they sell into the Florida market meets, on average, a
declining standard for GHG emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per unit
of fuel energy. The state should develop, with industry and stakeholder input, a set of
standards for low‐carbon fuels, which include biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, hydrogen,
compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, and low‐carbon ethanol blends
such as E10 or E85. The standard would be measured on a life cycle basis in order to include all
emissions from fuel production to consumption.
Fuel providers (defined as refiners, importers, and blenders of on‐road vehicle fuels) will need
to report on an annual basis that the fuel mixtures they provide to the market meet the low‐
carbon fuel standard. Fuel retailers should be encouraged to provide this information to
consumers at the point of sale to the extent information is available.
TLU-2.

Low Rolling Resistance Tires and Other Add-On Technologies

The goal of this policy is to improve the fuel economy of the light‐duty vehicle (LDV) fleet by
reducing the rolling resistance of replacement tires without reducing tire lifetime or otherwise
increasing the lifecycle carbon footprint of the tires. There are three avenues by which the
rolling resistance of tires may be reduced, and fuel economy improved as a result:
•

Consumers could purchase more tires currently available that have lower rolling
resistance.

•
•

Tire designs could be modified and new technologies could be introduced to reduce
rolling resistance.
Vehicle operations could be improved, especially through improved maintenance of tire
inflation.

Currently, tire manufacturers and retailers are not required to provide information about the
fuel efficiency of replacement tires. In addition, there is no current minimum standard for fuel
efficiency that all replacement tires must meet. State policy and action can help bridge this gap
through a variety of mechanisms. The state could set minimum energy efficiency standards for
replacement tires and require that greater information about Low Rolling Resistance
replacement tires be made available to consumers at the point of sale. Information also can be
provided to consumers about fuel efficiency and cost in relation to the purchase, maintenance,
and operation of their vehicles. The state could encourage or provide information about
complementary add‐on technologies that could facilitate vehicle operation practices which
improve fuel efficiency. One example is devices such as the Air Alert Valve Caps, which alert
vehicle owners when tire pressure is too low.
TLU-3.

Smart-Growth Planning

Smart‐growth planning looks at how land use planning, site planning, and urban design at the
community level can help achieve carbon and GHG emission reduction goals. The essence and
intention of smart growth within the context of climate change is to establish a policy
framework, clear guidelines, and measurement parameters for the development of new (and the
redevelopment of older) communities that will have a net‐zero‐carbon effect on the general
environment and reduce overall GHG emissions. This can be accomplished through the
complex interactions of the three primary elements of community development that have a
direct impact on GHG emissions and affect climate change:
•

Construction energy and building lifetime energy use as measured by the protocols of
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM) Green Building Rating
System, Green Globes, or the Florida Green Building Coalition (FGBC);

•

Individual VMT generation and other transportation energy use (such as deliveries,
maintenance, buses, security, health, fire, and safety) necessary to support human
communities; and

•

The changing of land uses from carbon‐sequestering land uses (such as forests,
agriculture, parks, and wetlands) to carbon‐releasing land uses (such as building sites
and roadways) and development patterns.

This policy aims to bring about reductions in GHG emissions through smart‐growth planning.
The state could achieve this by providing incentives and promoting redevelopment projects that
establish more energy‐efficient land use patterns. Any redevelopment project should consider
the 10 principles of smart‐growth in land use planning1. The 10 principles are as follows:

7) Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical environment areas;
8) Provide a variety of transportation choices;
9) Strengthen and direct development toward existing communities; and
10) Take advantage of compact building design.
The state also could maximize opportunities to retrofit existing buildings to meet LEED, Green
Globes, FGBC, or other approved certification programs that reduce energy consumption and
thus reduce GHG emissions.

TLU-4.

Improving Transportation System Management (TSM)

Transportation System Management (TSM) is the concept of pairing transportation demand
with transportation supply to help transportation networks serve the demand in an effective
and efficient manner. Effective system management may utilize a variety of strategies based on
advanced technologies, market‐based incentives, regulations, and design standards. Each
strategy provides a relatively small benefit to GHG reduction, but when applied in concert,
substantial gains can be achieved.
TSM strategies attempt to reduce the number of trips being taken by SOVs, shorten trip lengths,
reduce vehicle delay, increase the reliability of the transportation network, and reduce idling
and other transportation actions that result in increased GHG emissions. The goal of TSM is to
reduce the daily VMT per capita on the transportation network. Effective TSM also will reduce
VHT per capita, which measures the amount of traffic congestion delay. Reduction of either
VMT or VHT is highly correlated with a reduction in GHG emission.

5‐8
Chapter 5 – Transportation and Land Use

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
The state could develop and implement a variety of policies and strategies to reduce GHG
emissions through TSM. These policies and strategies could include program funding, financial
and development incentives, infrastructure investment, and regulatory requirements to
promote transportation system management improvements that result in reduced VMT and/or
VHT which, in turn, result in reduced GHG emissions. These actions, taken in concert with
other aggressive transportation and land use policy actions, should be designed to reduce urban
area VMT by 7‐10 percent by 2020 and by 9 ‐ 12 percent by 2050; VHT can be reduced by
amounts that are associated with these VMT reductions. VHT reduction is recognized as a
means of reducing driver delay while reducing fuel consumption in congested traffic.
TLU-5 &6. Land Use Planning Processes and Increasing Choices in Modes of
Transportation

TLU 5 & 6 were combined by the Action Team after it was determined that it was difficult to
accurately quantify and compare the cost per ton of CO2 reductions of transit and rail versus
other modes of transportation. The Action Team expressed concern that this quantification
might discourage the selection of transit and/or rail as a strategy for the reduction of GHG
emissions. The Action Team concluded that transit and rail are important GHG reduction
strategies that should be implemented despite high infrastructure costs. This policy seeks to
ensure that local and state land use and transportation planning consider the impact of land use
and transportation decisions on the reduction of GHG emissions. This policy also aims to
double transit ridership; to increase the percentage of people that walk, bicycle, carpool,
vanpool, or telecommute; and to develop and implement policies and strategies that include
program funding and financial incentives that expand non‐automobile infrastructure and
provide modal alternatives to SOV travel.
TLU-7.

Incentive Programs for Increased Vehicle Fleet Efficiency

Florida can reduce its GHG emissions by improving the fuel economy of the LDV fleet. This
recommendation includes several policies and programs to encourage the purchase of low‐
GHG‐emission vehicles through monetary and convenience rewards and incentives throughout
the state:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Tax credits for efficient vehicles.
Incentive programs for major corporate fleet owners, including rental car and taxi
cab companies.
CO2‐based registration fees and vehicle licensing fees.
Procurement of efficient fleet vehicles (public, private, or other).
Study of “feebates.”
Operating incentives for low‐GHG vehicles.
CO2‐based excise taxes.

Increasing Freight Movement Efficiencies

This policy recommendation aims to reduce the trucking industry’s carbon footprint and GHG

encouraging the development and expansion of intermodal and long‐distance rail capacity to
support both local and transcontinental rail service into and out of Florida. The U.S.
Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration) lists two major categories of
emissions‐reducing strategies that Florida can utilize in these goals:

•

Technical strategies, which modify a piece of equipment or its fuel to reduce emissions;
and

•

Operational strategies, which change how a piece of equipment is used, resulting in
lower emissions.

Chapter 6
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management
Overview
The Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW) sectors are responsible for moderate
amounts of Florida’s current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The total AFW contribution to
carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) gross emissions in 2005 was 15 million metric tons (MMt), or
about 11 percent of the state’s total. The AFW contribution to net emissions in 2005 was 3
percent of the state’s total, after accounting for the net sequestration of carbon in the forestry
sector.
Agricultural emissions include methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from enteric
(intestinal) fermentation, manure management, agriculture soils, and agriculture residue
burning. As shown in Figure 6‐1, emissions from soil carbon losses from agricultural soils,
livestock soils, manure management, enteric fermentation, and fertilizer application all make
significant contributions to the sector totals. Emissions include CO2 emissions from oxidized soil
carbon, application of urea, and application of lime. Sector emissions also include nitrous oxide
emissions resulting from activities that increase nitrogen in the soil, including fertilizer
(synthetic, organic, and livestock) application and production of nitrogen‐fixing crops
(legumes), and methane emissions from rice cultivation. There is no significant agricultural
burning activity in Florida; therefore, the emissions were estimated to be zero (prescribed
burning is covered under the forestry sector).
In keeping with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) methods and
international reporting conventions, the Inventory and Projections report covers sources of
GHGs from human activities. There could be some natural sources of GHGs that are not
represented in the inventory and forecast; however these are not addressed in the Governor’s
Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (Action Team) process. In the forestry sector, since
all of the state’s forests are managed in some way, all emissions are treated as “anthropogenic,”
or from human activities. GHG reporting conventions treat all managed forests as
anthropogenic sources. Sources such as CO2 from forest fires and decomposing biomass are
captured within the inventory and forecast (as part of the carbon stock modeling performed by
the U.S. Forest Service [USFS]). However, methane emissions from decomposition of organic
matter/biomass in forests are not currently captured due to a lack of data. This methane is from
decomposition in oxygen‐free (anaerobic) areas, particularly marshes and bogs.
The CO2 emissions occurring from the cultivation of organic soils always has been a primary
contributor to the state’s total agricultural GHG emissions. By 2025, the contribution from this
source is estimated to be more than 70 percent of the total agricultural emissions. Methane
emissions from digestive processes in ruminant animals, known as enteric fermentation, are
declining due to lower animal populations; however, they are estimated to be the second‐
6‐1

______________________________________________________________________________
highest contributor to agriculture sector totals in 2025 at about 13 percent. The next‐highest
contributor in 2025 is estimated to be livestock manure application to soils at about 6 percent.
Forestry and land use emissions refer to the net carbon dioxide (CO2) flux1 from forested lands
in Florida, which account for about 47 percent of the state’s land area. The inventory is divided
into two primary subsectors: the forested landscape, and urban forestry and land use. Both
subsectors capture net carbon sequestered in forest biomass, urban trees, landfills, and
harvested wood products. In addition, other GHG sources such as nitrous oxide emissions from
fertilizer application in urban areas and CH4 and N2O emissions from prescribed burns and
wildfires are included.
As shown in Table 6‐1, USFS data suggest that Florida’s forests sequestered about 21 MMtCO2e
per year in 2005 (this excludes estimates of carbon flux from forest soils based on
recommendations from the USFS). The negative numbers in Table 6‐1 indicate a CO2 sink rather
than a source. Even after accounting for the GHG sources from urban soils and prescribed
burns or wildfires, the forestry and land use sector is still estimated to have been a net GHG
sink of more than 20 MMtCO2e in 2005. Hence, during this period, forest carbon losses due to
forest conversion, wildfire, and disease were estimated to be smaller than the CO2 sequestered
in forest carbon pools such as live trees, debris on the forest floor, and forest soils, as well as in
harvested wood products (such as furniture and lumber) and the disposal into landfills of forest
products. The forecast for the sector out to 2025 shows a slightly declining trend in the levels of
sequestration due to losses of forested area associated with development.
Figure 6‐2 shows estimated historical and projected emissions from the management and
treatment of solid waste and wastewater. Emissions from waste management consist largely of
CH4 emitted from landfills, while emissions from wastewater treatment include both CH4 and
N2O. Emissions are also included for municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion. Overall, the
waste management sector accounted for about 5 percent of Florida’s total gross emissions in
2005. While emissions are expected to grow significantly by 2025, the contribution to the state’s
total is expected to remain at about 5 percent.
The Action Team acknowledges that there are higher levels of uncertainty in the GHG
emissions and forecasts in the AFW sectors compared with those in other sectors (e.g., those
where emissions are tied directly to energy consumption). There is a need for continuing
investment in research and measurement to refine the AFW Inventory & Forecast report (details
on key uncertainties are presented in the appendices).
Opportunities for GHG mitigation in the AFW sector involve measures that can reduce
emissions within the sector or reduce emissions in other sectors. Within the sector, changes in
crop cultivation can reduce GHG emissions by building soil carbon (indirectly sequestering
carbon from the atmosphere) or through more efficient nutrient application (reducing N2O

achieve GHG reductions by increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of the forests in
Florida.

For GHG reductions outside of the AFW sector, actions taken within the sector such as
production of liquid biofuels can offset emissions in the transportation sector, while biomass
used to produce electricity or steam can reduce emissions in the Energy Supply and Demand
(ESD) sector. Similarly, actions that promote solid waste reduction or recycling can reduce
emissions within the sector (future landfill CH4), as well as emissions associated with the
production of recycled products (recycled products often require less energy to produce than
similar products from virgin materials). Finally, urban forestry projects can reduce energy
consumption within buildings through shading and wind protection.
The following are primary opportunities for GHG mitigation identified by the Action Team:

•

Agricultural crop management: Implement programs with growers to utilize cultivation
practices that build soil carbon and reduce nutrient consumption. By building soil carbon,
CO2 is indirectly sequestered from the atmosphere. New technologies in the area of
precision agriculture offer opportunities to reduce nutrient application and fossil fuel
consumption. Improved harvesting techniques could also reduce fossil fuel consumption.

•

Agricultural land use management approaches to protect/enrich soil carbon: Incentive
programs are needed to protect crop lands from conversion to developed use or the
conversion of lands in conservation programs back to conventional tillage/plowing which
releases CO2. By protecting these areas from development, the carbon in above‐ground
biomass and below‐ground soil organic carbon can be maintained and additional emissions
of CO2e to the atmosphere can be avoided. Indirectly, these measures also support the

6‐4

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
objectives of “smart” development by helping to direct more efficient development patterns
(see Chapter 5, Policy Option TLU‐3—Smart Growth Planning).

•

Production of liquid biofuels: Production of renewable fuels, such as ethanol from crop
residue, forestry biomass, or municipal solid waste, and biodiesel from waste vegetable oils
can produce significant reductions when they are used to offset consumption of fossil fuels
(for example, gasoline and diesel in transportation and other combustion sources). This is
particularly true when these fuels are produced using processes and/or feedstocks that emit
much lower GHG emissions than those from conventional sources (sometimes referred to as
“advanced” or “next generation” biofuels). The goals to produce more biofuels in‐state are
linked to the recommendations under TLU‐1 for establishing a low‐carbon fuel standard
and thus consuming more biofuels in‐state.

•

Expanded use of forest and agricultural biomass: Expanded use of renewable energy from
biomass removed from the state’s managed forests, crop residues, lawn and garden waste,
or municipal solid waste can achieve GHG benefits by offsetting fossil fuel consumption (to
produce either electricity or heat/steam). Programs to expand sustainably produced biomass
fuel production will likely be needed to supply a portion of the fuel mix for the renewable
energy goals of ESD Policy Option ESD‐5 (see Chapter 3.)

•

Enhancement/protection of forest carbon sinks: Through a variety of programs, enhanced
levels of CO2 sequestration can be achieved and carbon stored in the state’s forest biomass.
These include afforestation (establishing forests on lands that have not historically been
under forest cover) projects, reforestation programs (restocking of harvested forests), urban
tree programs, wildfire risk reduction, and other forest health programs. Programs aimed at
reducing the conversion of forested lands to non‐forest cover also will be important to retain
what is currently a net forest CO2 sink in Florida.

•

Changes in municipal solid waste (MSW) management practices: By promoting advanced
MSW practices, the “cradle to grave” GHG emissions associated with collecting,
transporting, and managing MSW can be reduced. Hence, the emissions addressed here
include those from both fossil fuel use and waste management (primarily landfills).

Key Challenges and Opportunities
In the agricultural sector, the Action Team found significant opportunity in promoting biofuels
production using feedstocks and production methods with superior GHG benefits (superior to
conventional starch‐based ethanol). It should be noted that the GHG benefits did not include
any indirect impacts associated with emissions resulting from land use change.2 The
recommendations on biofuels production were aimed primarily at production of advanced
(cellulosic) biofuels. The production and use of these fuels was found to offer substantial GHG
2

Recent research (e.g., Searchinger, T., et al., “Use of U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases
Through Emissions from Land Use Change,” Sciencexpress, February 2008) has indicated that incorporating land
conversion impacts into GHG analysis may remove any GHG benefits. Due to concerns and uncertainties such as
these, the Action Team developed a biofuels production recommendation focused on biomass, not food crops.

reduction potential (more than eight MMtCO2e by 2025; see AFW‐7 in Appendix D). The Action
Team quantified two separate goals associated with biofuels production and use: a primary goal
of using 20 percent of available biomass to produce biofuels by 2025, and a secondary goal to
produce enough biofuel in‐state to offset 25 percent of the state’s fossil liquid fuels consumption
by 2025. Based on the available estimated biomass resources in the state, this secondary goal
will be difficult to achieve without significant reductions in fossil fuel use by 2025 (for example,
emphasizing the importance of TLU recommendations aimed at reducing vehicle miles
traveled).
The Action Team recommendation AFW‐4 promotes the expanded use of biomass as an energy
source for producing electricity, heat, and steam. Use of biomass to supplant fossil fuels is
estimated to reduce about 40 MMtCO2e by 2025. The Action Team conducted a limited
assessment of the available biomass resources in the state that indicated sufficient resources
were available through 2025 to achieve the goals for both the liquid biofuels recommendation
above and this biomass for energy option. However, the Action Team also recognizes the need
for additional research on this issue, so that better estimates of sustainably‐produced energy
feedstocks are assured. As shown in Table D‐1 of Appendix D, the Action Team currently
estimates that the policy recommendations and business as usual biomass demand will require
about 75 percent of the available biomass supply.
Related to biomass utilization for energy purposes, recommendation AFW‐9 seeks to improve
commercialization of technologies to utilize biomass feedstocks or to produce bio‐products.
These technologies could include biomass gasification of wastewater treatment plant biosolids,
livestock manure, or other organic wastes for energy use and as a direct GHG reduction
measure. These technologies also could include anaerobic digestion of livestock manure, or
other wastes to reduce methane emissions, and then utilize the methane for energy purposes.
Research and development is needed (pilot‐scale projects) in addition to funding or other
incentives to build commercial‐scale facilities.
AFW‐10 seeks to increase the production and consumption of locally‐produced (state or
regional) agricultural products. To the extent that this can be accomplished, overall energy
consumption associated with getting food to consumers is reduced and food security in Florida
is strengthened. Due to the complexities of the design considerations needed to achieve a more
efficient food production system in the state and a lack of data on current food imports, this
recommendation requires additional assessment.
Also, within the agriculture sector, the Action Team recommends programs to promote soil
management to increase soil carbon levels, thereby indirectly sequestering carbon from the
atmosphere. These programs, combined with additional measures to promote more efficient
nutrient application, were estimated to achieve a reduction of more than one MMtCO2e per year
by 2025. Mechanisms that would assist farmers in reaching the goals of these recommendations
include consideration of carbon sequestration offsets in any future cap‐and‐trade program in
which the state participates.

______________________________________________________________________________
Related to terrestrial carbon management, land use management approaches in the agriculture
and forestry sectors are recommended to protect existing above and below ground carbon
stocks and potentially enhance terrestrial sequestration in the future. By preserving agricultural
and forested lands (AFW‐1 and AFW‐6), the Action Team estimates GHG savings in 2025 of
more than one MMtCO2e. To achieve these reductions, the state will need to work closely with
local planning agencies, landowners, and other stakeholders to identify lands suitable for
acquisition and conservation easements as well as funding mechanisms. Some of the support
could come through existing state programs, such as Florida Forever. Another benefit to these
options, which was not quantified, is the reduction in vehicle miles traveled due to more
efficient development patterns (see TLU‐3).
The estimates for GHG reductions for forest preservation above are conservatively low. The
assumed losses of forest to development of about 7,400 acres per year are based on total forest
area losses between 1995 and 2005 and include forest area gains that occurred as a result of land
use change (such as agricultural land converted to forests). Also, due to high levels of
uncertainty in existing emission estimates, the benefits estimated for AFW‐1 do not include soil
carbon; however, significant losses in soil carbon occur when forests are converted to developed
use.
Within the forestry sector, forest management programs (AFW‐2 and AFW‐3) have the potential
to deliver more than 24 MMtCO2e/year of GHG reductions in 2025. These programs include
reforestation and afforestation (see page 6‐10), urban forestry, and wildfire
reduction/restocking/other forest health approaches to minimize terrestrial carbon losses, while
enhancing carbon sequestration. The urban forestry component also has the potential to reduce
fossil fuel consumption through shading and wind protection of homes and commercial
buildings.
For the urban forestry component of AFW‐2, the goals are to increase canopy cover in Florida
communities such that by 2025, 3 percent of total metropolitan GHG emissions will be offset
through carbon sequestration and energy reductions. The recommendation includes a
secondary goal to increase tree canopy cover in all developed areas with population greater
than 500 residents per square mile to 30 percent by 2025.
Action Team recommendation AFW‐8 seeks to reduce the “cradle to grave” GHG emissions
associated with MSW management. The recommendation recognizes that a holistic approach to
developing an efficient solid waste system is needed to reduce GHG emissions associated with
waste collection, transport, and final management (such as landfilling). The goal of AFW‐8 is to
reduce these “cradle to grave” emissions by 25 percent by 2025. The Action Team recognizes
that there are a number of different approaches for waste management entities to use in
reducing emissions, including the use of more efficient collection and transport vehicles, use of
renewable fuels, and landfill gas management (such as greater methane collection at landfills
and use of advanced waste management approaches, including bioreactors). Based on the
recommendation, more than four MMtCO2e of GHG emissions are estimated to be reduced
annually by 2025.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
As noted above, the 10 policy recommendations for the AFW sector address an array of
activities capturing emission reductions, both within and outside of the AFW sectors (such as
energy consumption in the ESD and TLU sectors). Taken as a whole, the AFW
recommendations offer significant cost‐effective emission reductions, as shown in Table 6‐2.

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management Sector
Policy Descriptions
The AFW sectors include emissions mitigation opportunities related to the use of biomass
energy, protection and enhancement of forest and agricultural carbon sinks, control of
agricultural N2O emissions, production of renewable liquid fuels, reforestation/afforestation,
and lower MSW emissions.

AFW-1

Forest Retention—Reduced Conversion of Forested to Non-Forested
Land Uses

By retaining forest cover in the state, the current levels of carbon dioxide sequestration (more
than 20 MMtCO2/yr) are protected. In addition, significant losses in both above‐ground carbon
and soil carbon occur during conversion to developed use. The goals of this recommendation
are to stabilize the state’s forest base and to achieve no net loss in forested lands by 2015. The
goals will need to be achieved through a variety of mechanisms, which could include additional
funding to existing programs such as Florida Forever, incentives to forest landowners to retain
their lands as working forests, consideration of forest management carbon offset projects in
emerging cap‐and‐trade programs, and active engagement with non‐government organizations
and stakeholders to increase lands with perpetual conservation easements or acquisitions.

AFW-2

Afforestation and Restoration of Non-Forested Lands

This recommendation seeks to increase the sequestration potential of the state’s forests by
increasing the forest base through afforestation projects, increasing sequestration potential
through reforestation (re‐stocking forests), and aggressive urban tree planting programs. The
urban tree element of this recommendation has an additional benefit of reducing energy
demand through shading of homes and commercial buildings (producing a greater GHG
benefit than the sequestration of carbon in these trees). The afforestation goal is to increase the
area of forested lands in the state by 50,000 acres annually through 2025. For reforestation, the
goal is to implement reforestation activity on all harvested acres by 2025. For urban forestry
there are both primary (based on offsetting metropolitan GHG emissions) and secondary (tree
canopy cover) goals; both of these could be met through aggressive tree planting goals of 6.7
million trees on average per year through 2025.

______________________________________________________________________________

AFW-3

Forest Management for Carbon Sequestration

This recommendation focuses on the state’s existing forested lands—both private forests and
non‐federal publicly‐owned lands. The recommendation recognizes the significant role that
Florida’s forests play in lowering the state’s net GHG emissions (about 20 MMtCO2e/yr) and
that management could be enhanced to achieve greater net GHG benefits. In the state’s
plantation forests, the 2025 goal is to increase the levels of productivity by 10 percent annually
through enhanced management, thereby increasing sequestration rates and timber, pulp wood,
or biomass for energy purposes. For non‐federal publicly‐owned forests in the state, this
recommendation calls for improved management practices to be implemented on 25 percent of
these lands by 2025.

AFW-4

Expanded Use of Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, and Steam
Production

This policy dedicates a sustainable quantity of biomass from agricultural crop residue, wood
industry process residues, unused forestry residues, and MSW biomass resources for efficient
conversion to energy and economical production of heat, steam, or electricity. This biomass
should be used in an environmentally acceptable manner, considering proper facility siting and
feedstock use (proximity of users to biomass, impacts on water supply and quality, control of
air emissions, solid waste management, cropping management, nutrient management, soil and
non‐soil carbon management, and impacts on biodiversity and wildlife habitat). The objective is
to create concurrent reduction of CO2 due to displacement of fossil fuels considering life‐cycle
GHG emissions associated with viable collection, hauling, and energy conversion and
distribution systems. The primary goal of this option is to increase the use of biomass feedstocks
for energy purposes by a factor of five by 2025.

AFW-5

Promotion of Farming Practices that Achieve GHG Benefits

This recommendation addresses both agricultural soil carbon management, as well as nutrient
management to achieve GHG benefits. For soil carbon management, conservation‐oriented
management of agricultural lands, cropping systems, crop management, and agricultural
practices may regulate the net flux of CO2 from soil. This recommendation has four separate
elements:
•

soil carbon management, where CO2 reductions occur indirectly via the building of soil
carbon levels;

•

nutrient management, where GHG reductions occur through more efficient use of
fertilizer (lowering fossil‐fuel use though lower application energy requirements, as well
as lifecycle GHG reductions associated with the production and transportation of
fertilizers in addition to reduced nitrous oxide emissions following application);

6‐11
Chapter 6 – Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
•

agricultural land conversion to reduce GHG emissions by establishing permanent cover
on marginally productive lands (thereby increasing both above‐ and below‐ground
carbon stocks);

•

an element covering improved harvesting methods, which seeks to produce GHG
reductions through the use of more efficient harvesting technologies and practices.

AFW-6

Reduce the Rate of Conversion of Agricultural Land and Open Green
Space to Development

By reducing the losses of agricultural lands and open green space, above‐ and below‐ground
carbon stocks are protected and more efficient land use is supported (as recommended in TLU‐
3—Smart Growth Planning). This option seeks to reduce the rates of conversion of these lands
to developed use by 50 percent by 2025. Although the levels of estimated direct GHG
reductions are moderate (0.5 MMtCO2e/yr by 2025), the indirect benefits achieved through the
linkage to smart growth planning and subsequent reductions in vehicle‐miles traveled are
expected to be substantial (see TLU Appendix C).

AFW-7

In-State Liquid/Gaseous Biofuels Production

This recommendation promotes sustainable in‐state production and consumption of
transportation biofuels from agriculture, forestry, and MSW feedstocks in order to displace the
use of gasoline and diesel. This recommendation also promotes the in‐state development of
feedstocks, such as cellulosic material and production facilities to produce either liquid or
gaseous biofuels with low carbon content. To achieve true gains in reducing GHGs and
offsetting fossil fuel use, promoting biofuel production must be coupled with strong policies to
reduce overall transportation fuel consumption. Upon successful implementation of this policy,
Florida consumption of biofuels produced in‐state will produce better GHG reduction benefits
than these same fuels obtained from a national or international market due to lower embedded
CO2 (resulting from out‐of‐state fuels produced using feedstocks/production methods with
lower GHG benefits, and from transportation of biodiesel, ethanol, other fuels, or their
feedstocks from distant sources).

AFW-8

Promotion of Advanced Municipal Solid Waste Management
Technologies (Including Bioreactor Technology)

This recommendation seeks to improve the GHG profile of MSW management in the state by
promoting more efficient collection, transport, and waste management technologies and
practices. There are a number of ways that the “cradle to grave” GHG profile of MSW
management could be improved. The emissions include those from collection and transport of
MSW and the final management of MSW, which currently occurs largely at landfills in Florida.
These include more efficient collection vehicles, use of biofuels, route optimization,
6‐12
Chapter 6 – Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
management of MSW in bioreactors, more efficient landfill gas collection systems, and more
efficient use of landfill methane.

AFW-9

Improved Commercialization of Biomass-to-Energy Conversion and BioProducts Technologies

This recommendation recognizes the need for programs to “ramp up” the commercialization of
promising technologies to utilize biomass for energy or to produce bio‐products with lower net
GHG emissions. These could be emerging technologies, including emerging biomass
gasification combined cycle (BGCC) electricity production, pyrolysis, and plasma arc
technologies, as well as technologies that are farther along in commercial deployment
(anaerobic digestion of organic wastes). Bio‐products for use as building materials or other
products or bio‐based chemicals have the potential for reducing the life‐cycle GHG emissions
associated with the bio‐products’ fossil‐based or higher embodied energy counterparts.

AFW-10 Programs to Support Local Farming/Buy Local
The Action Team approved this policy as a non‐quantified recommendation. The
recommendation seeks to enhance Florida’s food system to produce more of the agricultural
products needed by the state’s consumers. When locally produced agricultural products
supplant those from out‐of‐state or out‐of‐country, the embedded GHG emissions associated
with transporting those items are reduced. To achieve this reduction, programs are needed to
incentivize local production and consumption of fresh produce, dairy, meat, and fish. The Fresh
From Florida retail campaign has achieved some success in this area in recent years through
engagement with the major retail food outlets in the state. Similar programs will need to be
developed and implemented. In addition, a much larger and tougher aspect of this option will
be to develop new infrastructure to transport, process, package, store, and distribute locally or
regionally produced food. The establishment of this enhanced infrastructure will require a
significant amount of study, planning, investment, and promotion to occur.

Chapter 7
Government Policy and Coordination
Overview of Government Policy and Coordination
In Executive Order 07‐128, Governor Crist directed the Action Team to develop
recommendations for “strategic investments and public‐private partnerships in Florida to spur
economic development around climate‐friendly industries and economic activity that reduces
emissions in Florida” as well as “strategies and mechanisms for the long‐term coordination of
Florida’s public policy in the areas of economic development, university‐based research and
technology development, energy, environmental protection, natural resource management,
growth management, transportation, and other areas as needed to assure a future of prosperity
for Floridians in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” To address this charge, the Technical
Working Group (TWG) of Government Policy and Coordination was formed.
The types of policies considered for this “sector” are not as readily quantifiable in terms of
greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions and cost‐effectiveness calculations as other TWGs.
Nonetheless, if successfully implemented, the recommendations will contribute to GHG
emission reductions and enhance economic benefits associated with many other policy
recommendations described in Chapters 3 through 6.
The Government Policy and Coordination TWG presented five policies that were ultimately
adopted for recommendation by the Action Team. These policies are listed in Table 7‐1 and fall
into two categories: efforts that enable or enhance the successful implementation of policies
recommended for specific sectors, and policies that foster the development and creation of
technologies and businesses that mitigate GHGs and promote the creation of jobs and economic
growth. Finally, the Government Policy and Coordination TWG examined the multiple
planning authorities at all levels of government in Florida, and the Action Team has
recommended measures to incorporate GHG considerations into government planning
processes and improve coordination among entities with overlapping jurisdiction.
All five policy recommendations were adopted unanimously by the present and voting Action
Team members.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
One of the key challenges facing Florida is the uncertainty of future federal policy. As the state
seeks to address the challenges of mitigating GHG emissions and anticipates the effects of
climate change beyond the reach of achievable emissions reductions, the role that the federal
government will play remains a matter of speculation. Recent actions such as those contained
within the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act provide some guidance; however, the
nature, timing, and scope of more significant federal actions are not easily predicted. Of
particular interest is the potential for a national market‐based program limiting GHG emissions
or the expansion of the Clean Air Act to incorporate GHG emissions reduction requirements.
Recent Florida actions such as the 2007 Executive Orders and House Bill 7135 passed by the
2008 Legislature put in place an array of measures to reduce emissions and build a regulatory
framework for many of the policies recommended.
The Government Policy and Coordination TWG recommendations include a number of
suggestions to address fragmented, overlapping, and sometimes contradictory planning and
regulatory authority between levels of government and separate agencies. The success with
which climate change concerns can be interwoven into planning for future land use,
transportation, and water management will be critical to achieving many of the needed long‐
term emission reductions. Leadership by the state is critical, as demonstrated by recent
executive and legislative actions and the current Action Team effort, but inter‐jurisdictional
cooperation is equally critical to sustain the effort in the long run.

7‐2
Chapter 7 – Government Policy

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Nearly all of the TWG’s recommendations contain language speaking to the need for immediate
action. Many of the recommendations address inter‐jurisdictional planning and other measures
that require the concurrence of entities not directly involved in the Action Team process or
subject to direction from the executive branch. It is therefore expected that many of these
recommendations will be implemented only through negotiation and agreement, sometimes
among multiple parties, or through legislation. The potential for extended discussion and
debate has caused the Action Team in some cases to cull a subset of policies and measures that
could be implemented in the near‐term in order to emphasize the Action Team’s sense of
urgency.

Overview of Policy Recommendations and Estimated Impacts
The Government Policy and Coordination TWG organized its recommendations around five
major initiatives:
•

targets, reporting, funding, and accountability measures;

•

public awareness and education;

•

inter‐governmental planning coordination and assistance;

•

green business development; and

•

a proposal to introduce core competencies into professional licensing.

Within these five are 43 specific actions, initiatives, or programs, which, if successfully
implemented, would result in the attainment of the policy goals and significantly contribute to
the success of many of the recommendations.

Government Policy and Coordination-Policy Descriptions for Recommendations

GP-1

Targets, Reporting, Funding, and Accountability Measures

This policy recommends specific administrative, goal‐setting, and accountability measures
necessary to implement many of the policies recommended for other sectors and measure
progress over time. The State of Florida is committed to significant reductions in GHG
emissions and has established emissions inventory, forecasting, reporting, and registry
functions in state agencies.
The following recommendations are offered as guidance on how to implement and manage
these administrative, goal‐setting, and accountability functions:

7‐3
Chapter 7 – Government Policy

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
(1) periodically review and revise established goals or targets for statewide GHG‐emission
reductions, renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and energy efficiency targets;
(2) establish RPS and energy efficiency portfolio standard (EEPS) targets and mandatory
GHG emissions reporting, inventory, and forecasting functions at state agencies;
(3) develop an inventory and forecast system that is aligned with national protocols and
tailored to specific emissions and/or “carbon sinks” found in Florida;
(4) provide technical assistance to emissions reporters and encourage participation;
(5) institute an accountability program to measure and report progress in reducing GHG
emissions;
(6) establish GHG reduction targets for local, state, and regional government operations and
school districts;
(7) measure and report on research and development (R&D), job creation, and new business
investment resulting from related “green” economy programs and review the
effectiveness of state funds used to support and/or promote those programs; and
(8) beginning in 2010, the Florida Energy and Climate Commission (FECC) should review
progress toward achieving Executive Order 07‐127 GHG reduction goals, and review
and affirm or propose revisions to the goals every three years, assuming the necessary
resources are available to properly complete this review.
GP-2

Public Awareness and Education

Floridians “doing their part” to address climate change assumes that citizens know what can
and should be done and are provided the tools and the incentives to do so. To address this
need, the Action Team proposes one public awareness and education program with measures
tailored to the needs of three major audiences: K‐20 education; the public at large; and local,
state, and regional government.
The Action Team proposes that the following programs and measures be adopted to effectively
reach these audiences:
(1) create and maintain one or more outreach coordinator positions in relevant executive
agencies specifically tasked with climate change issues;
(2) assess the level of public understanding of the impacts of climate change and of state‐
specific actions to deal with climate change;

7‐4
Chapter 7 – Government Policy

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
(3) create a Florida Climate and Energy Challenge program by June 2009 that can craft the
message of how important it is for all Floridians to pitch in and reduce their energy
usage;
(4) establish a recurring awards program to recognize leadership and attainment of goals
and objectives of the Florida Climate Change Action Plan;
(5) engage and partner with the Florida business community to coordinate and leverage
private sector‐sponsored messages and initiatives to help implement the Florida Climate
Challenge;
(6) educate broadcasters, reporters, editorial boards, and others about climate change, the
risks it imposes, and actions Floridians can take;
(7) provide and advertise marketplace incentives to adopt and purchase goods with the
minimum carbon footprint;
(8) ensure performance standards for the inclusion of climate change curricula in public
education (K–12), identify gaps in climate change education, and provide specific
curricula to fill any gaps;
(9) integrate best practices into public school design and construction;
(10) organize groups of educators to identify, assemble, and employ climate change
curricula appropriate to specific age groups;
(11) integrate climate change into core college curricula, promote research into climate
change and solutions at state universities, and develop university Centers of Excellence
on climate issues, new approaches, and technologies;
(12) develop assessment tools to determine the impact of climate change curricula; and
(13) include climate change discussions especially at state‐supported venues, such as science
centers, zoos, and museums.
The goals of the program would be that, by January 2010, that 50 percent or more of Floridians
and Florida businesses will acknowledge by survey the seriousness of climate change impacts
and will have reduced their personal usage of energy from carbon‐emitting sources by 10
percent, and, by the same date, all governmental agencies at the state, regional, and local levels
will have reduced their usage of energy from carbon‐emitting sources by 25 percent. Also, by
June 2010, the Florida Climate and Energy Challenge will be expanded, and additional milestones
and energy reduction targets will be established to meet the 80 percent reduction from 1990
levels by the 2050 goal.

GP-3

Inter-Government Planning Coordination and Assistance

Given the high priority of climate change mitigation in the State of Florida, numerous local,
state, and regional government agencies are tasked with implementing climate policies or, at a
minimum, integrating energy efficiency principles into their operations. Efficient coordination
among agencies and between local, state, and regional government will enhance overall
effectiveness, reduce overlap, and eliminate barriers to GHG mitigation efforts.
Local governments will be among the state’s most vital partners in addressing climate change.
Local and regional authorities have primary responsibility for land‐use, development, and
infrastructure planning, and have major responsibility for building code compliance.
The State of Florida is unique in that it has an existing comprehensive planning framework,
which is the foundation of the state’s growth management program. It provides for the
coordination of state, regional, and local planning decisions. To facilitate and expedite climate
change mitigation and adaptation efforts throughout the state, Florida’s policymakers should
work through the Florida Department of Community Affairs in conjunction with the Regional
Planning Councils to use the local government comprehensive planning process to improve
coordination and ensure that each level of government is working toward the same goals in a
mutually supportive and consistent manner.
State government can help lead the way and build on the existing work that is in progress at
local and regional levels by:
(1) collecting and facilitating access to information about best practices;
(2) providing cost‐benefit analyses of the various approaches available to local governments
in a fiscally constrained environment;
(3) documenting the economic benefits or payoffs for local governments, their
constituencies, and businesses that are considering the implementation of green
practices;
(4) eliminating state subsidies or favorable tax treatment for programs or policies that are
contrary to GHG reduction efforts;
(5) identifying and eliminating state policies that unduly contribute to the generation of
GHG emissions;
(6) finding ways to say “yes” to local and regional partnerships and solutions;
(7) funding the Florida Green Governments Grant Program and similar programs that
support local and regional government initiatives; and

7‐6
Chapter 7 – Government Policy

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
(8) expediting state‐level review and decision‐making processes, if applicable, to facilitate
implementation of local and regional efforts. Creating a statewide process to achieve
GHG reductions will allow all coordinating agencies to work in concert. In addition,
determining regional GHG averages and encouraging use of a consistent system for
local governments to quantitatively assess their reduction progress would facilitate their
engagement in this effort and allow them to gauge their progress and efficacy.
The Action Team proposes the following goal as a measure of success in this area: Contingent
upon having available funding and necessary programs in place, all counties with a population
of more than 200,000 should develop current GHG emissions inventories and mitigation action
plans by the end of 2010.
GP-4

“Green” Business Development Policies

Climate change impacts are likely to have significant effects on all sectors of Florida’s economy.
Some sectors will face acute challenges, while others will enjoy substantial growth
opportunities. GHG mitigation and climate adaptation also are likely to create new economic
and employment opportunities. Substantial investment is expected in energy efficiency
implementation and renewable energy technologies. These investments hold the promise of
diversifying and strengthening the Florida economy.
The intent of this policy is to encourage and facilitate the involvement of funding and
investment sources, business interests, and entrepreneurs in quickly seizing business
opportunities related to GHG reductions and climate change solutions. Florida should foster
research and development associated with GHG emissions reduction, renewable energy, and
energy efficient technologies. The state should also promote business, job development, and
workforce training in alternative low‐carbon fuels and vehicles and other alternative low‐
carbon technologies, such as energy efficiency.
The Action Team recommends that Florida:
(1) Unify existing resources and entities with those created under House Bill 7135 (FECC
and the Florida Energy Systems Consortium) to support businesses in greening their
operations and promote business development opportunities in climate protection and
adaptation, including seeking or stimulating funding investments;
(2) undertake an analysis of potential opportunities in green industry development and
target those technologies for which Florida has an advantage;
(3) analyze targeted incentives to promote private investment in these technologies or
industries, such as tax credits, investment in academic programs and research, grant
funding, and investment in workforce development;

7‐7
Chapter 7 – Government Policy

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
(4) consider funding opportunities for clean energy technologies through the 33 investment
funds managed by the State Board of Administration, among which is the Florida
Retirement System Pension Plan Trust Fund;
(5) promote the use of commercially ready technologies through a targeted RPS, an EEPS,
building codes, appliance standards, rebates, and tax incentives;
(6) encourage “business incubator” programs at Florida universities and colleges to attract
and support new business development related to the new energy economy;
(7) offer incentive points for competitive grant programs for state‐to‐business economic
development for businesses that have undertaken GHG reduction and energy efficiency
programs;
(8) create or designate a clearinghouse entity to match technology developers and other
climate solution entrepreneurs with necessary financing;
(9) promote the use and development of effective water conservation plans, low‐energy
water treatment technologies, and water‐conserving products and technologies, such as
those certified through the Environmental Protection Agency’s WaterSense program or
the Florida Water Star public education program initiated by the St. Johns River Water
Management District;
(10) require the use of applicable “green buildings” standards for the award of state
contracts for state‐owned and state‐funded projects;
(11) favor contracting with firms that undertake green standards in business operations and
in proposed contract work; and
(12) define “green jobs” and have Enterprise Florida conduct or commission a study of job
opportunities and develop a targeted strategy for Florida.
GP-5

Introduce Core Competencies Into Professional Licensing Programs

Florida has more than 200,000 licensed built‐environment professionals, including building
contractors, architects, landscape architects, engineers, interior designers, and others involved
in the design and construction of Florida’s residential and commercial sites and buildings. It is
critical that Florida’s licensed professionals—who are responsible for the design, development,
and construction of Florida’s built environment— incorporate climate change and energy
efficient technologies, materials, and design into their projects to facilitate the reduction of GHG
emissions. Therefore, the state needs to establish core competency provisions for licensed
professionals who provide site and architectural design, site engineering, site construction,
building construction, and building operations efficiencies services. The state also needs to
require professional organizations, in support of their respective professional membership, to
7‐8
Chapter 7 – Government Policy

www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
develop and administer continuing education programs that address new technologies,
standards, and materials designed to reduce GHG emissions and promote energy efficiency.
Additionally, within Florida’s State University System, design and engineering programs
should establish required courses of study that focus on the issues and importance of climate
change mitigation and energy efficiency toward establishing a sustainable Florida. Targeted
professions should include architecture, interior design, civil engineering, environmental
engineering, building inspectors, code compliance officers, building trades (plumbing and
HVAC), general contractors (site and building), real estate, building operators, landscape
architecture, and in the training for those pursuing state certification to become teachers.
Specific climate change‐related questions would be added to the respective state licensure
examinations. To maintain professional licenses within the designated design professions, the
state would require the respective professional organizations to develop and administer
continuing education programs that reinforce the importance of reducing GHG emissions and
promoting energy efficiency.
In addition, the state should develop a Florida Green Building certification program for licensed
professionals involved in the design and construction of residential and commercial buildings
and development sites.

Chapter 8
Adaptation Strategies
Among the topics considered by the Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change,
adaptation is quite distinct from mitigation. Not only is adaptation about coping with the
consequences of climate change rather than trying to prevent or limit them, but adaptation itself
is a very broad topic, covering the many sectors that may be affected by global climate change.
This includes infrastructure; the built environment; coastal resources; water resources; extreme
climate events (and emergency response); marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems; and
human health. Adaptation to climate change will be addressed by many state agencies, regional
and local entities, non‐profit organizations, the private sector, and individuals, thus making
adaptation diffuse and diverse. This complicates adaptation policy development and
implementation. Accordingly, the approach taken by the Action Team was to review the
myriad resources and associated policies that are affected or could be affected by climate
change to ensure their robustness and resilience in the face of climate change.
The Adaptation Technical Work Group (TWG) addressed a wide variety of topics in its
deliberations. The work of the TWG also is unique among the six TWGs because there is no
common metric for measuring success of adaptation measures. GHG reductions can be
compared based on such common metrics as dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. There
is no parallel outcome on adaptation. Some adaptations concern human life, others property,
and still others are about reducing impacts of climate change on ecosystems and threatened or
endangered species.

Science and Impacts of Climate Change1
Florida, because of its low‐lying topography and geographical location in the sub‐tropics, is
especially vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) projected a warming in the
southeastern United States of approximately 4 to 6oF (2 to 3oC) for a medium scenario of
greenhouse gas emissions2. Higher emissions scenarios, which are quite possible, would result
in larger temperature increases. Temperatures are projected to rise more in the summer than in
the winter.

The IPCC also projected that precipitation patterns will change. It is difficult to confidently
predict precipitation changes on a scale as small as Florida, but the climate models tend to
project decreased precipitation over the Southeastern United States. The models show a
tendency toward reductions in summer precipitation3.
The IPCC also projected a sea level rise (SLR) of at least 9 inches to 23 inches by the end of the
21st Century4. This projection was based on published reports through 2005 and did not
account for dramatically increased rates of land‐based glacial melting observed in Greenland
and Antarctica since the publication of the latest IPCC assessment5. Many scientists have stated
that increases in melt rates in Greenland and Antarctica will make significant contributions to
sea level rise beyond that projected in the IPCC Assessment6. For example, the Science and
Technology Committee of the Miami‐Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force
projected a SLR of at least 1.5 feet in the coming 50 years and at least 3‐5 feet by the end of the
century7.
In general, elevations of barrier islands are only minimally above sea level and much of
Florida’s barrier islands have been subject to extensive development of high value oceanfront
real estate. These areas are at significant risk from SLR and increased intensity of hurricanes.
Beach erosion, which already costs Florida more than $600 million per year,8 is likely to
increase. Coastal wetlands could be inundated by sea level rise. The Everglades represent the
largest and most important of Florida’s coastal wetlands. As sea levels rise, brackish waters will
extend further inland and dramatically change these and other freshwater ecosystems.
Unconfined coastal aquifers, such as the Biscayne Aquifer in South Florida, will become more
saline because of sea level rise.
Florida was hit by 10 named storms in 2004 and 2005 and, to date, has been hit by several large
hurricanes and tropical storms in 2008. The intensity of hurricanes is projected to increase,9
although there is disagreement in the scientific community about whether the hurricane
intensity has changed as a result of climate change. It is documented that wind speeds in the
most powerful hurricanes have increased since the mid‐1980s.10

Even if hurricanes do not change, higher sea levels alone will result in higher storm surges.
More intense hurricanes will likely lead to even higher storm surges and more damaging wind
speeds.
According to Florida Atlantic University’s study “Florida’s Resilient Coasts,” Murley et al. 2008
states:
In addition to sea level rise and hurricanes, there are numerous other potential effects of global
warming that could affect Florida’s communities and environment physically, economically
and socially, including:

•

Prolonged drought affecting water supplies, agriculture, and habitat;

•

More wildfires due to excessive drought and heat;

•

More flooding due to more torrential rains;

•

More frequent and lengthy heat waves creating increased energy demands and health
hazards to young children, elderly, and infirm;

•

Potential insect infestation and insect‐borne diseases resulting from increased temperatures
combined with increased flooding due to storms;

•

Bleaching of coral reefs and adverse effects on marine life and fisheries;

•

Ecological changes in the Everglades and other natural systems affecting plant ecology,
wildlife, the marine estuaries and coast, and tourism; and

•

Economic, environmental, and social impacts.

Framework for Action and Goals
Based on the knowledge about the risks from climate change, the TWG developed a framework
of adaptation topics and identified goals and strategies to address each topic. The framework
and major objectives are:

ADP‐1. Advancing Science Data and Analysis for Climate Change
Scientific data, analyses, and predictive modeling are needed to understand how Florida’s
climate is likely to change, the consequences of change, and possible solutions.

ADP‐2. Comprehensive Planning
Florida’s local, state, and regional comprehensive plans should be amended based on the
best available data, include goals, objectives, and policies that will prepare the state for
adapting to the future impacts of climate change, such as SLR. Future policies should use
8‐3
Chapter 8 – Adaptation Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
incentives to encourage desired actions, including encouragement not to repeat past
decisions that will leave new development exposed to SLR and other climate change
consequences.

ADP‐3. Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity
Florida’s ecosystems should be managed for resiliency by enhancing their ability to
naturally adapt to the stresses of climate change and other pervasive threats, including
invasive exotic species. In addition, climate change should be incorporated into all aspects
of the beach management and coastal construction regulatory programs.

ADP‐4. Water Resources Management
In order for Floridians to have adequate water supply available to meet their basic
reasonable and beneficial needs while meeting the requirements of natural systems, state
and local governments need to pursue intense conservation of all water uses and alternative
water sources, and include stakeholder involvement in statewide and regional water supply
planning processes. Climate change may impact existing sources due to many factors
including altered rainfall patterns and salt water intrusion into coastal aquifer systems.
Methods to quantify and plan for uncertainties and risks related to population growth,
climate change, and environmental regulations will be needed.

ADP‐5. Built Environment, Infrastructure and Community Protection
The reduction of potential damage to the built environment from the impact of natural
hazards, especially from those hazards caused or exacerbated by climate change, should be
a high priority for all levels of government and the private sector in Florida.

ADP‐6. Economic Development
Policies, programs, and implementation mechanisms should be developed to support the
ability of Florida’s economy to adapt to climate change.

ADP‐7. Insurance
Insurance rates should reflect risks from climate and climate change and be equitable and
affordable. In addition, policies should discourage high risk development, particularly
along the coast.

ADP‐8. Emergency Preparedness and Response
Florida’s future emergency preparedness and response functions should build on the
excellence gained through past experience to ensure sufficient capacity and efficacy in
protecting public heath and welfare against the risks from climate change such as more
intense hurricanes and floods and potential spread of disease and heat stress.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

ADP‐9. Human Health Concerns
Florida’s health plan should incorporate considerations of climate change to protect the
health of its citizens.

ADP‐10. Social Effects
Issues of social justice should be addressed. Food, water, and housing security should be
protected and behavioral responses to extreme events and climate change need to be better
understood.

ADP‐11. Organizing State Government for the Long Haul
A single point of focus within state government should be created that can continue
assessing the risks posed by climate change, develop increasingly informed adaptation
planning, and adjust adaptation planning in Florida as events on the ground change. The
Legislature created the Florida Energy and Climate Commission, which appears at present
to have sufficient scope, powers, and resources to accomplish the intent of this element of
adaptation planning. However, it will be important to assess the effectiveness of the
commission in addressing adaptation.

ADP‐12. State Funding and Financing
Florida should be prepared to fund the protection of human health and critical
infrastructure, as well as address other impacts of climate change, where feasible, within a
framework of protection, accommodation – and, in some cases, retreat.

ADP‐13. Coordination with Other Regulatory and Standards Entities
Functional collaborative relationships between the State of Florida and selected federal
government agencies entities, other states and countries, and key professional societies
should be developed on climate change issues of mutual interest. Research agendas and
funding sources should be aligned to address common interests and priorities.

ADP‐14. Education
Florida should become a national and international leader in the dissemination of climate
change information in the process of educating a broad diversity of constituents with
cutting‐edge and successful public education programs.

Recommended Early Action Items
The following recommendations were identified as Early Action Items for consideration by
Florida’s policymakers:

Research
○

Foster and support a climate science research agenda for Florida with broad priorities.
Institute a scientific advisory council on climate change to advise state government on
this research agenda. Identify and establish long‐term funding to support research.
Funding should be protected from short‐term economic or political cycles.

○

Conduct research needed to support incorporation of climate change into the protection
of Florida’s ecosystems and biodiversity.

○

Enhance support for mapping, monitoring, and modeling, all of which will be necessary
to provide information to support policy‐making. In addition, effective monitoring
programs are needed to detect impacts of climate change; modeling is also needed to
project impacts with more accuracy.

Comprehensive Planning
○

State and regional agencies should provide financial and technical assistance to local
governments to ensure timely updates of local plans.

○

Local governments should review their coastal management elements to determine
necessary amendments to make their coastal areas (especially the coastal high‐hazard
area) resilient to the future impacts of climate change, including sea‐level rise.

○

Florida statutes, regulations, policies, and the Florida Administrative Code should be
reviewed by the Florida Attorney General to determine potential conflicts between
private property rights and the state and local governments’ responsibility to protect
communities.

Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity
○

Ensure that a representative portfolio of Florida’s terrestrial, freshwater, and marine
natural communities with redundant representation of habitats and species and
connecting corridors is protected and managed in a manner that maximizes the health
and resilience of these communities when facing climate change impacts.

○

Reduce and discourage future reliance on bulk‐heading/hardening to stabilize estuarine
and beach shorelines. Shoreline hardening should be considered only after a full and
cumulative assessment of short‐ and long‐term impacts to coastal resources and coastal
ecosystems. Establish policies and regulations that clearly define when, how, where, and
under what circumstances emergency beach stabilization is allowed.

○

The vulnerability of Florida’s fish and wildlife to climate change impacts should be
assessed, the most vulnerable species should be identified, and plans prepared to
enhance their chances of survival where there is a reasonable likelihood that the species
will survive over the next 50 years.

Water Resources Management

______________________________________________________________________________
○

•

•

Identify and quantify the potential effects of differing climate change scenarios on the
vulnerabilities and reliability of existing water supplies with emphasis on source water
availability and quality.

Built Environment
○

Require that the Florida Building Code incorporate building design criteria for resisting
future loads that may result from the impact of climate change‐exacerbated hazards
during a minimum service life of 50 years.

○

Develop required training provisions to educate professionals in relevant fields (such as
architecture, engineering, and construction management) on the need to incorporate
adaptation to climate change as a basis for establishing design criteria for new
infrastructure. Completion of such required training provisions would be a condition for
licensing.

Public Education and Outreach
○

Provide immediate training on climate change adaptation.

○

Initiate a major public education campaign.

The Action Team noted the importance of all options but the
focus for analysis and subsequent recommendations was on
Tier 1 options.

GHG = greenhouse gas; MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; $/tCO2e = dollars per metric ton
of carbon dioxide equivalent; HB = House Bill.
Note: The numbering used to denote the above priority policy options is for reference purposes only; it does not
reflect prioritization among these important policy options.
Note 2: Negative numbers in the “Net Present Value” column denote options for which the discounted value of the
monetary benefits of the option are greater than the discounted total costs of the option.
Note 3: The emissions reduction and cost estimates shown for each individual option presume that each option is
implemented alone. Many options interact extensively, as they target the reduction of energy use or emissions from
the same sources. Therefore, if multiple options are implemented, the results will not simply be the sum of each
individual option result. After individual option assessments were complete, a “combined policies” assessment was
conducted to estimate total emission reductions, and to capture the overlaps among policies that are reported here.

Costs for New Renewable Power Plants
This subsection presents estimates for power plant cost data for Florida. Florida‐specific power
plant data are available from the Florida Public Service Commission’s (PSC’s) Web site.1 The
data were submitted by various stakeholders in response to the PSC’s data request, which
resulted from a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) workshop held on July 11, 2008. The
purpose of the questionnaire was to provide the PSC with information on cost and on the
technical potential of renewable energy technologies within the State of Florida. Section
366.92(3)(a), Florida Statutes, directs the PSC to evaluate the current and forecasted installed
capacity and levelized cost for each renewable energy generation method through 2020 as part
of developing RPS requirements for the state. Both regulated electric utilities and interested
parties were invited to provide information to the PSC. Completed questionnaires are available
on the PSC Web site.2

Participants were provided with a specific data entry form, available at the PSC’s Web site.3 The
completed forms yielded several types of data on both renewable energy and some
conventional power plants, including capital and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs,
levelized cost, capacity rating, capacity factor, and emission factors. Renewable energy sources
that were included are solar, wind, biomass, hydro, landfill gas, municipal solid waste, ocean
energy, and chemical processing heat.
Table A‐1 summarizes median values of the response data combined with input from TWG
members. The median values were used in the analysis because capacity rating and/or capital
costs for some types of power plants are significantly different among data sources.4 Levelized
costs in Table A‐1 are CCS calculations based on the assumptions reported here.
Table A‐2 reports the capital cost assumptions and resulting levelized cost calculations for 2025.
Changes in capital cost from 2009 to 2025 are based on output from the Assumptions to the

We did not include some data sources for this summary table when they present data in an inconsistent unit such as
$/kW/year for capital costs or when the respondents did not provide specific data because such data are not available,
unknown, or confidential (e.g., some biomass plants and municipal solid waste plants). We also excluded a few data
sources on the grounds that they appear as outliers, presenting extremely low or high values compared with others
(e.g., $13,000/kW in one case for offshore wind).

For Solar PV, cost assumptions were derived from the presentation “Solar Energy Industry
Forecast: Perspectives on U.S. Solar Market Trajectory”, by the United States Department of
Energy Solar Energy Technologies Program, dated June 24, 20087. This source quotes levelized
costs for actual Residential, Commercial and Utility scale systems in 2005 as $0.23‐$0.32, $0.16‐
$0.22 and $0.13‐$0.22 per kWh generated, respectively. The same source (slide 13) shows cost
“targets” for 2010 of $0.13‐$0.18, $0.09‐$0.12 and $0.10‐$0.15 per kWh, respectively, for the three
scales of systems. Additional calculations were required to estimate costs through 2025, based
on continuation of the trends reported in the presentation but leveling out with a minimum
price of $0.05/kWh. The source does not provide assumptions on capital cost or O&M costs, just
levelized costs.

Approach for Calculating Sector Totals that include Option Overlaps
As noted in Table A‐1, the emissions reduction and cost estimates shown for each individual
option presume that each option is implemented alone. Many options interact extensively, as
they target the reduction of energy use or emissions from the same sources. Additionally, the
combined impact of multiple policies leads to different impacts on emissions as systems (such
as the electricity generation system) react differently to large changes than they do to small.
Therefore, if multiple options are implemented, the results will not simply be the sum of each
individual option result. After individual option assessments were complete, a “combined
policies” assessment was conducted to estimate total emission reductions, and to capture the
overlaps among policies that are reported here.
For the ESD sectors, this combined policies approach required two steps: first estimate the
extent that options that are likely to target the same reductions in energy use (the overlap
between ESD options) and second estimate the impact of the combined options on the electricity
system.

Approach Used for Quantifying the Overlaps between ESD Options
The ESD options most likely to overlap are those targeted at electricity reductions, in particular
ESD‐12 and ESD‐13a. To account for this overlap, it is assumed that if both options were
implemented together, the energy savings would be lower than the sum of the two individual
options by an amount roughly equivalent to 30% of the energy savings attributed to ESD‐13a as
a stand‐alone option.
No other options appeared to have significant overlap with one another.
Approach Used for Quantifying the Suite of Electricity Demand Options
This section discusses the quantification approach for integrating the ESD options that have an
impact on electricity demand. All recommended ESD options result in some change to
electricity generation – demand‐side efficiency, power system efficiency, renewable energy, or
additional generation from on‐site combined heat and power systems.
Projecting the impacts of the mix of policy options on electricity emissions differs from
estimating the impact of individual options. The avoided emission rate that was used to
estimate the emission reductions from individual actions was estimated based on the marginal
emission rate – the emissions associated with electricity generation that is most likely to be
avoided when electricity demand decreases. For the individual options, it was estimated that
reductions in electricity generation requirements through 2015 will come from the average
emissions rate of then‐existing fossil‐fueled sources; by 2025 the predominant effect is assumed
to be a reduction in reference case new fossil fuel plant builds during the 2015‐2025 period.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
However when all options are applied together, the savings in electricity consumption by 2025
exceeds the generation of new fossil fuel plants. Thus the electricity savings from the combined
options would need to displace other generation resources – for example, new nuclear
generation or existing fossil fuel plants. Displacing new nuclear plants is inconsistent with
implementing all ESD options since one of the options (ESD‐6) recommends adding new
nuclear reactors that are additional to the new nuclear capacity that is added in the reference
case. The addition of new nuclear reactors to meet the goals of ESD‐6 while avoiding the new
nuclear facilities that are currently planned by the utilities is an inconsistent evaluation of likely
impacts. Thus for the combined options, we estimated the amount of existing fossil fuel
generation that would be displaced. The mix of displaced coal and natural gas consumption
was based on the share of generation by fuel type in the reference case. Generation from
petroleum sources is relatively low in Florida and projected to decline significantly in the
reference case. It is assumed that changes to electricity and generation due to the options would
have only minor changes on petroleum use.

ESD-5. Promoting Renewable Electricity Generation through Renewable Portfolio
Standard (RPS), Incentives and Barrier Removal

Policy Description
The fundamental policy objectives of encouraging renewable electricity generation are to reduce
GHG emissions, provide fuel diversity, and stimulate Florida’s economy.
A Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) sets the minimum amount of electricity from renewable
sources that must be generated and supplied to the electricity grid in a given year. This
minimum requirement is applied to each utility, but provisions are often made for utilities to
purchase renewable electricity or credits from other utilities.
Renewable energy incentives and barrier removal can complement, or possibly replace, an RPS
as the policy tool to increase distributed and central grid‐based resources of renewable energy
throughout the state. Institutional and market barriers to the development of renewable energy
include price distortions, failure of the market to value the public benefits of renewables, and
the social cost of fossil fuel technologies, inadequate information, institutional barriers to grid
interconnection, high transaction costs due to small project size, high financing costs because of
lender unfamiliarity, and perceived risk. These can be overcome through a suite of financial and
regulatory redresses, as well as through information and public education campaigns.

Policy Design
Goals: 20% of retail sales are supplied by renewable electricity by 2020.8
Timing: Ramp up beginning in 2012 until the final level is reached in 2020 and continues
linearly after 2020.
Parties Involved: Florida Energy and Climate Commission (FECC), PSC, DEP, investor‐owned
utilities, public power, electric cooperatives, and state government. Also renewable energy
manufacturers, and local, state, and regional banks and other financial institutions.
Other: For the purposes of this policy, renewable energy is defined as follows, according to
Section 366.91, Florida Statutes, created by the 2008 Florida Legislature: “Renewable energy” is
defined as electrical energy produced from a method that uses one or more of the following
fuels or energy sources: hydrogen produced from sources other than fossil fuels, biomass, solar
energy, geothermal energy, wind energy, ocean energy, and hydroelectric power. The term

Alternative goals (20% by 2025 and 30% by 2025) were also considered, and results are included under
quantification methods below.

includes the alternative energy resource, waste heat, from sulfuric acid manufacturing
operations.9

Implementation Mechanisms
The Action Team recommends that the FECC study whether renewable energy providers
should be granted priority access to the grid.
An RPS is a requirement that each utility in the State must supply a certain, generally fixed
percentage of electricity from eligible renewable energy sources. In some states, and in the draft
rulemaking for Florida, utilities can meet their RPS, or environmental portfolio standard (EPS),
by purchasing certificates from eligible energy projects, typically referred to as Renewable
Energy Certificates (RECs). See Related Policies/Programs in Place section below for more
information on the Florida rulemaking process on RPS.
Financial obstacles can be addressed through property tax exemptions, exclusions, and credits;
deductions to cover the expense of purchasing and installing renewable energy equipment; loan
programs to aid in financing the purchase of renewable energy equipment; and grant programs
designed for R&D or to help a project achieve commercialization.
Examples of financial incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy resources
include:

•

Direct subsidies for purchasing and selling renewable technologies;

•

Tax credits or exemptions for purchasing renewable technologies;

•

Feed‐in tariffs, which provide direct payments to renewable generators for each kWh of
electricity generated from a qualifying renewable facility, can be used by utilities (as a rate
schedule) to fund renewable energy projects as a means to comply with a RPS;10

•

Tax credits for each kWh generated from a qualifying renewable facility;

•

Regulatory policies that provide incentives or assurance of cost recovery for utilities that
invest in central station renewable‐energy systems; and

•

Incentives for solar/thermal water heating to offset the use of fossil fuels.

The Legislature, the Florida PSC, and other relevant state agencies are encouraged to prioritize
the identification and elimination of barriers that impede the development of renewable
resources in the state.
Regulatory policies can include solar or wind easements of access rights, development
guidelines at the local level to enhance renewable energy generation (for example, requiring
proper street orientation), and requirements that utilities provide information and utility
leasing programs for renewable energy production to customers in remote regions.
Pricing and metering strategies can provide price signals and revenue streams to support
investment in and optimal operations of renewable energy systems. Net metering is a policy
that allows owners of grid‐connected distributed generation (DG, generating units on the
customer side of the meter, often limited to some maximum kW level) that produce excess
electricity to sell it back to the grid, effectively “turning the meter backward.” Net metering
provides several incentives for renewable DG by reducing transaction costs (for example, no
need to negotiate contracts for the sale of electricity back to the utility) and increasing revenue
by setting compensation at retail electricity rates rather than at utility‐avoided costs. In addition
to net metering, pricing strategies of relevance to distributed renewable energy systems can
include “time‐of‐use” (TOU) rates. These are fixed rates for different times of the day or for
different seasons that reflect the time‐varying value of electricity.
Well‐designed interconnection rules will ensure that distributed power products meet
minimum requirements for performance, safety, and maintenance and, at the same time,
significantly advance the commercialization of these technologies. Such rules, generally
developed and administered by a state’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC), establish clear and
uniform processes and technical requirements for connecting DG systems to the electric utility
grid. Interconnection standards will reduce barriers to connection of DG systems to the grid.
Connecting to the grid enables the facility to (a) purchase power from the grid to supply
supplemental power as needed (for example, during periods of planned system maintenance),
(b) sell excess power to the utility, and (c) maintain grid frequency and voltage stability, as well
as utility worker safety.
Implementation mechanisms should involve manufacturers; producers; local, state, and
regional banks; and other financial institutions.
Renewable energy sources should receive subsidies at least equal to nuclear energy sources to
level the playing field, noting the current $9/month per household fee for nuclear.
An Integrated Resources Planning (IRP) system should be used to maximize efficient and
renewable energy generation. IRP (see option ESD‐7) could support development and
installation of these technologies, if they meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
The PSC is currently engaged in rulemaking that would allow for a utility to meet the RPS
either directly through the production of renewable energy or through the trading of renewable
energy credits. The percentage must be based on retail sales, and HB 7135 also allows for added
weight to those credits for solar and wind. This rule must be presented to the 2009 Legislature
for its consideration and ultimate ratification. The Florida PSC and the FECC are working to
catalog all available renewable resources in the state.
Section 366.91(b), Florida Statutes, provides the following definition: “renewable energy” means
electrical energy produced from a method that uses one or more of the following fuels or energy
sources: hydrogen produced from sources other than fossil fuels, biomass, solar energy,
geothermal energy, wind energy, ocean energy, and hydroelectric power. The term includes the
alternative energy resource, waste heat, from sulfuric acid manufacturing operations.11
Florida has taken a multifaceted approach to reducing barriers to renewable generation and
bringing those technologies to market. For example, the PSC has approved standard offer
contracts to reduce regulatory lag and negotiations between qualifying renewable facilities and
utilities. The PSC has also recently approved tariffs to implement one of the nation’s most
aggressive net‐metering laws by expediting interconnection and allowing up to 2 MW for
inclusion of offset at the retail rate for 12 consecutive months. Moreover, Florida has a host of
state‐sponsored financial incentive programs to bring these technologies to market. These
programs include the highly successful solar rebate program ($5 million), sales tax deductions
for hydrogen and biofuels ($3 million), corporate investment tax credits for hydrogen and
biofuels ($11 million), a renewable energy and efficiency grant program ($7 million), Farm‐to‐
Fuel ($8 million), and Florida Energy Systems Consortium ($50 million).
It is important to note that the passage of HB 7135 requires the PSC to view DG under 2 MW as
energy efficient. In addition, a housing appraiser cannot financially penalize a Floridian for
adding a renewable energy device to his or her home.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct) directs states to consider upgrading their standards for
interconnecting small generators within one year of enactment.12

Quantification Methods: Renewable resources are added to the mix according to key
assumptions below, based on using lowest cost resources first, up to estimated resource
potential. Capacity of each type of plant was added starting in 2009 (except for offshore wind,
for which additions start in 2018 under option 2), with linear increases in capacity to meet the
target goal for each resource by 2020 or 2025 with the exception of “PV, Over 1 MW”. “PV, Over
1 MW” is phased in exponentially to reach the targets, starting at 500 MW in 2009 through 2020,
and phased in linearly thereafter. The goals for renewable energy production were interpreted
as percentages of forecast retail electricity sales in the target year.
Key Assumptions: The results shown in tables A‐5‐2 include generation and capacity to meet
the alternative goals (options 2 and 3) that were analyzed for this policy. The Action Team
based its recommendations on Option 1, generating 20% of Florida’s electricity sales from
renewable electricity by 2020.

State tax credits are not included.
Avoided costs of electricity: $67/megawatt‐hour (MWh) (see Common Assumptions). The
avoided cost of solar PV power is assigned a higher avoided cost of $134/MWh based on the
estimated incidence of peak power avoided by solar PV. This cost was estimated based on
consideration of the coincidence of solar PV generation (timing of solar PV generation based on
solar PV output)14 with a May through October summer peak period from noon to 8 PM daily.
Energy produced by solar PV systems during this period (about one‐third of the annual output)
was ascribed a combined capacity and energy value based on the cost of ownership and
operation of gas‐fired combustion turbine units. Data for the costs and performance of gas‐fired
combustion turbines were estimated based on averages of data for seven combustible turbine
units planned for Florida for the period 2008‐2013.15

Additional notes on calculations and data sources used for all plant types are as follows:
All Plant Types: A Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 8.5 percent/yr was used for all plant
types. CCS analysts suggest that this figure might be revised to 11 percent/yr, which would
increase the annualized capital costs of all plant types somewhat. Data referred to below as
derived from “Florida‐based sources” are primarily based on data collected by the Florida
Public Service Commission, and presented as a series of documents on a “renewable energy
data” web page 16, as listed under “Data Sources” above. In some cases, these data have been
augmented with information provided by Technical Working Group members or their
representatives.
Biomass: Cost and performance data assumptions are as shown in Table A‐1 for “Biomass–
direct combustion and plant matter.” Cost and other data for this plant type were derived based
on the composites and averages from a number of largely Florida‐based sources, including
information provided by Florida Power and Light. The resource potential was provided by the
Florida Climate Action Team’s Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW) TWG. The
resource includes Logging Residue, Urban Wood Waste, Primary Mill Residue, Agricultural
Residue and Vegetable and Fruit Waste, Agricultural Energy Crops, Willow and Hybrid Poplar
or Other Fast‐growing Hardwoods, Other Woody Energy Crops, plus yard and landscape
waste (considered a portion of municipal solid waste).
Waste Heat From Sulfuric Acid Production: Cost and performance data assumptions are as
shown in Table A‐1 for “Chemical processing heat” as provided by The Mosaic Company,
which also provided the estimate of the extent of this resource.
New Hydro: Cost and performance data assumptions are as shown in Table A‐1 for “Run‐of‐
River hydro,” but with a considerably higher Variable O&M estimate based on the average of
data provided by two Florida sources. The potential of this resource, however, was judged by
in‐state experts to be negligible, due to very low hydraulic head, so no additional hydropower
was included for this Option.
Landfill Gas: Cost and performance data assumptions are as shown in Table A‐1, and are based
on several Florida data sources. The capital cost shown is a median estimate of three Florida
sources. The resource potential was provided by the AFW TWG.
PV, Under 1 MW: Cost assumptions are based on a report shown on the DOE/EERE website

commercial, and utility solar PV systems for 2005, plus target costs for 2010 and 2015. Costs for

PV, Over 1 MW: Cost assumptions are based on a report shown on the DOE/EERE website
“Costs of Solar Power from Photovoltaics.”18 This report provided costs for residential,
commercial, and utility solar PV systems for 2005, plus target costs for 2010 and 2015. Costs for
PV over 1 MW were estimated using the utility sector costs, with capital cost declines after 2015
based on the 2010 to 2015 trend (see table above). A price floor of 5 cents/kWh was used,
reflecting the graphs in the presentation that extended cost projections to 2020. The capacity
factor of 20% assumes that large PV arrays will be located in high solar resource areas of the
State. By way of comparison, a June 2008 study by Lazard titled “LEVELIZED COST OF
ENERGY ANALYSIS – VERSION 2.0”, computes levelized costs of power from utility‐scale
photovoltaic power systems of approximately 100 to 150 $/MWh, depending on the technology
type (thin‐film costs are lower) and other parameters. Lazard values are based on capital cost
assumptions (the Lazard values range from $3500 to $6000 per kW), capacity factor assumptions
(Lazard values vary from 20 to 26 percent), and the inclusion in the Lazard analysis of an
investment tax credit of 30 percent. Note that solar thermal power systems have not been
included in this analysis. As the costs and capacity factors of stand‐alone solar thermal systems
are generally considered similar to those of utility‐scale solar PV systems, including these
systems as options in the analysis would not change the results markedly. Solar thermal power
systems that are integrated with fossil fueled generation offer somewhat lower costs, but the
prospects for integrating such systems with existing fossil‐fired plants in Florida is thought to
be fairly limited—in the hundreds of MW. The costs used for solar PV power do not include
costs for back‐up power systems, which, depending on the utility system configuration at the
time of high penetration of intermittent resources into the grid, may be needed. A number of
studies, including experience in countries with a high penetration of intermittent resources in

their power grids, suggest that such resources can be accommodated without great difficulty. A
number of documents are available that touch on this topic19.
Offshore Wind: Cost and performance data assumptions are as shown in Table A‐1 for “Wind
offshore;” capital costs are based on a median of several Florida data sources, as is the assumed
capacity factor. It is noted that there are considerable technological and permitting unknowns
regarding offshore wind development in Florida, which will also affect the extent of the
resource that can be developed. Wind capital costs, both offshore and coastal, are assumed to
decline by a total of 9 percent between 2009 and 2025. It has been noted that European sources
for the variable operating and maintenance costs of wind power may allow the figures used in
this analysis to be updated, though changes in these costs will not markedly effect cost results.
Coastal Wind: Cost and performance data assumptions are as shown in Table A‐1 for “Wind
coastal”; capital costs are based on a median of several Florida data sources, as is the assumed
capacity factor. It is noted that the coastal wind resource in Florida may be limited; one utility
estimate suggests that the practically usable resource may be in the range of 600 to 900 MW,
with the lower end of this range considerably more likely.

ESD-6. Nuclear Power

Policy Description
Nuclear power has historically presented a low‐GHG source of electricity. However, no new
commercial reactor has come on line in the United States since 1996 due to extremely high
capital costs, the absence of any plan or technology for permanent disposal of nuclear waste,
and risks to public safety exemplified by high‐profile accidents at Three Mile Island and
Chernobyl. The current federal administration has been supportive of nuclear expansion,
emphasizing its importance in maintaining a diverse energy supply and its reputation for
producing electricity with negligible greenhouse gas emissions during operation. Congress has
also offered significant financial subsidies for new nuclear plants in an effort to jump‐start the
industry, including limitations on liability for nuclear accidents.
Today, nuclear power plants provide about 20% of electric power nationally. The role of
existing and new units needs to be considered for a comprehensive climate‐change policy
process.

Policy Design
Goals: The installation of two additional (relative to the reference case) reactors/units of 1,100
MW each are added in 2020.
The reference case assumes the facilities and capacities shown in Table A‐6‐1, including four
currently planned 1,100 MW reactor units for Turkey Point and Levy.
Timing: New plants operational in 2020.
Parties Involved: U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), PSC, Progress Energy Florida
(PEF), FPL and possibly Gulf Power and the Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA).
Other: none

Implementation Mechanisms
Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) (see option ESD‐7) could support development and
installation of these technologies, if they meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
With the construction of a traditional electric generator, the utility must assume all the costs of
permitting, planning, and construction until the plant is operational, and only when it begins
producing electricity may the utility begin collecting cost recovery revenues. The design,
permitting, planning, and construction of a nuclear facility may take from 8 to 10 years to
complete. The long planning and permitting process for nuclear facility means that a utility

A‐24

______________________________________________________________________________
would have to assume all costs to develop the project for a decade before it could begin
recovering those expenses. In recognition of that burden and to stimulate the development of
new nuclear facilities in Florida, during the 2007 session, the Legislature passed, and Governor
Crist signed, legislation allowing utilities to begin recovering the expenses associated with
nuclear facilities in advance. During the 2008 legislative session, HB 7135 added the recovery of
expenses associated with new, expanded, or relocated electric transmission lines needed for the
operation of a nuclear power plant. A provision was added to allow an electric utility to obtain
a separate permit to begin construction of facilities (such as access roads, rail lines, or electric
transmission facilities) on a site in support of a future nuclear generator before the nuclear
certification is issued.
The current federal administration has been supportive of nuclear expansion. Congress has also
offered significant financial subsidies for new nuclear plants in an effort to jump‐start the
industry, including limitations on liability for nuclear accidents. Florida utilities may or may not
be eligible for these subsidies. The US DOE recently announced submittal of a license
application (LA) to the NRC seeking authorization to construct America’s first repository for
spent nuclear fuel and high‐level radioactive waste at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. Currently, the
waste is stored at 121 temporary locations in 39 states across the nation.
In Florida, a total of 5,400 MW of nuclear generation is planned through 2020.

Quantification Methods:
Generation from nuclear plants was calculated on the basis of capacity and capacity factor, from
option goals. Generation is assumed to start in 2020 and continue at the same level through
2025.
Key Assumptions:
The Action Team recommended that analysis be completed using a mix of costs from PEF and
FPL. The results shown assume a total levelized unit cost of nuclear power of about $100 per
MWh (all costs in 2006 dollars) generated20, which assumes a useful life (and life for calculation
of annualized capital costs) of 40 years21, a capacity factor of 92%, an average installed capital

Note that this value is lower than, for example, the range of low to high estimates for the levelized cost of power
from Florida Power and Light’s (FPL) proposed Turkey Point Six plant, (11 to 14 cents/kWh), but that latter is
expressed in year 2018 dollars.
20

It has been noted that given the current trend toward life extension of nuclear reactors, it may be realistic to assume
that new nuclear plants will operate for 60 years. This may affect overall life‐cycle costs, but is likely to have a
modest impact, if any, on the cost estimates shown here, as financing (and thus levelized payments) will likely be
based on the standard lifetime.

cost of $7,091/kW22, $79/kW‐yr fixed O&M costs, $3.1/MWh variable O&M costs, $15/MWh fuel
costs23, and a 8.5%/yr weighted average cost of capital24.
It should also be noted that the levelized costs of generation for nuclear power (and avoided
cost benefits), as for other options considered in this document, has been ascribed to the years in
which generation (in this case) occurs. To the extent that some of these costs will need to be paid
before—in some cases many years before—the reactors come on line, AND to the extent that the
time value of these costs are not reflected in the capital costs above, the process of calculating a
discounted value for costs and benefits of power may undercount, perhaps substantially, the
actual cost per ton of GHG emissions avoided by ESD‐6.
Avoided costs of electricity: $67/megawatt‐hour (MWh) (see Common Assumptions).
Avoided GHG emissions for electricity: 0.58 MtCO2e/MWh in 2017, 0.41 MtCO2e/MWh in 2025
(see Common Assumptions).

Key Uncertainties
The construction of nuclear plants is directly tied to the price of oil, and there is significant
uncertainty in future oil prices. Also no new commercial reactor has come online in the United
States since 1996 due to high capital costs, the uncertainty of Yucca Mountain availability for
waste storage, and risks to public safety exemplified by high‐profile accidents at Three Mile
Island and Chernobyl.
An Action Team member has suggested alternative nuclear power costs, based in part on data
provided in an article by authors from the Rocky Mountain Institute25, that include capital costs
that are 25 to 50 percent higher than those above, adds taxes and insurance, decommissioning,
and nuclear waste management costs totaling $11/MWh, and applies a lower capacity factor of
80 percent to estimate a levelized cost of nuclear power of about $175/MWh (assumes capital
cost 50% higher than the estimate provided above). Using these data (all other assumptions
This figure is derived from the average of cost estimates for the proposed Progress Energy Levy 1 plant, and the
FPL Turkey Point Six plant, converted to 2006 dollars. As one of these two plants would be the first plant to be built
on a site, and thus more expensive than a subsequent unit this may slightly (a few percent) overstate the cost of the
units included in ES‐6, as the latter are likely to be units added to existing plant, not the first plants at a new site. On
the other hand, nuclear power plant costs have been rising significantly in recent years as commodity prices (steel,
cement, copper) and other costs related to reactor construction have risen. As a consequence, additional real
escalation in nuclear plant costs, though not included in this analysis, could be possible.
22

This value is somewhat higher than the approximately $9/MWh figure reported by two Florida utilities, but is
consistent with several national and regional studies, which report a range of $12 to $20 per MWh (for example, Jim
Harding, Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, Economics of New Nuclear Power and Proliferation Risks in a
Carbon‐Constrained World, June 2007), and seems more consistent with recent uranium price trends.
23

24 As with renewable energy plants, CCS analysts suggest that this figure might be revised to 11 percent/yr, which
would increase the annualized capital costs for nuclear power plants somewhat.

being equal) would reduce the 2025 emissions reductions from ESD‐6 to 6.3 MMtCO2e/yr, and
increase the net cost of avoided emissions to about $115/T CO2e.

Additional Benefits and Costs
There are significant potential risks associated with nuclear power, including unresolved waste
disposal issues, negative impacts on human health, cost overruns, and siting and permitting
issues that must be considered. The Action Team also recommends vigorous efforts in Florida
and across the nation to continue to improve safety standards for nuclear waste material
including management, security, transmittal, long‐term storage and reprocessing of spent
nuclear material.

ESD-7. Integrated Resource Planning (IRP)

Policy Description
IRP is a planning process that strives to meet needs for electricity services in a manner that
meets multiple objectives, such as least cost and meeting emissions standards, fuel diversity,
and RPS requirements. An IRP process should include evaluation of all options from the supply
and demand sides in a fair and consistent manner, building in flexibility to account for future
uncertainties. While originally targeted primarily toward cost minimization, IRP processes have
increasingly considered the environmental risks and the potential costs associated with future
regulation of GHGs.
With a growing population and increased demand for electricity, Florida must manage and
diversify the risk of volatility in energy markets and the need to reduce GHG emissions from
the utility sector. In doing so, it must reduce overall costs to ratepayers who are suffering under
high gasoline and electricity prices.
In 2007, Florida’s residential electricity rates were the 16th highest in the nation.26 Florida relies
on fossil fuel plants for about 85 percent of its electricity, placing it at considerable risk in the
new, global markets for fossil fuel electricity. The essential forum to address these concerns is in
the planning and acquisition of electric generation resources. In Florida, the Ten‐year Site Plan
proceeding, a process driven by load forecasting, is viewed as the central planning platform.
This assumes the building of additional generation in order to meet growing demand. It affords
only marginal consideration for conservation or non‐fossil fuel options in meeting demand,
while placing its highest priority on minimizing the direct, short‐run costs to utilities.
Key electricity planning activities take place in other forums that tend to fracture the overall
economic analysis of cost effectiveness in meeting energy demand in Florida. The planning
forums include:
(i)

(iv)
(v)
(vi)

determination of need or siting cases;
review of utility power purchase agreements;
transmission and distribution planning;
fuel cost adjustment reviews;
rate case and rate design proceedings; and
environmental compliance review.

Florida has no comprehensive process which allows regulators to balance the economics and
nuances of these planning needs to suit the state’s energy objectives, or the consumer’s budget.

In 2007, Florida’s residential electricity rates were 5% higher than national average, 16th highest rates in the
country. Energy Information Administration. Average Retail Price of Electricity to Ultimate Customers by End‐Use

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Therefore each of these forums is driven by the traditional process, namely econometric
projections of load, and the automatic construction of supply‐side resources to meet it. Thus, it
is difficult to ensure that ratepayers get reasonable value for the investments they contribute to
utilities. For most consumers, this is determined by the value they receive at the end use of
electricity. There is little or no attention paid to this metric in planning.
At a time when externalities are deeply affecting the costs to deliver electricity, a true
understanding of all the external costs, and how they impact the end use price of electricity is
vital. Even more important is an understanding of resources that effectively manage these
ultimate costs. The present process can tend to filter or narrow the measurement of actual costs
to provide end use energy service. It assumes fossil fuel plants are the standard bearer,
requiring all other energy resources to beat this approach to costing. This comparison includes
pressure to underestimate the costs of environmental compliance, and distort the benefits of
energy efficiency and renewables. These are dangerous policy omissions in a state where
natural and physical resources necessary to support fossil fuel plants are quickly diminishing.
A missing element of Florida’s present planning is a holistic, economic framework. It is
recommended that Florida undertake a true integrated resource planning regime which
embraces the idea of “least cost‐best fit” as its primary criteria.

Principles of Integrated Resource Planning
Integrated Resource Planning (“IRP”), as it relates to electric utilities, is an economic planning
process designed to identify the lowest practical cost at which a utility can deliver reliable
energy services to its customers. It differs from traditional resource planning, and from the 10‐
Year Planning process, in that it requires analytical tools that assess and compare the costs and
benefits of demand and supply‐side energy resources. It should identify and standardize the
critical assumptions across each of the varied planning forums which drive utility resource
decisions.
The energy service objectives of the State of Florida extend well beyond the individual or
collective definition of cost minimization for electric utilities. With the level of uncertainty in
energy markets, IRP must be adopted to clearly focus on the state’s energy service objectives, in
order that oversight of utility resource decisions can ensure consistency and compatibility with
the state’s needs.
Fundamentally, IRP recognizes that the economic costs customers face are the combination of
the price of kilowatt hours (kWh), the efficiency of the generation of those kWhs, and the
efficiency of electric devices in converting the kWhs to an end use. In addition, IRP recognizes
that in the general cost of the kWhs, consumers ultimately pay for externalities such as
environmental compliance, transmission congestion, and market volatility. Consequently,
mitigation of these costs has a value which is integral to the planning process. This is a distinct
expansion of the planning analysis, looking beyond the short‐run costs (and cost minimization)
of utilities, to look additionally at the costs, and potential benefits to the consumer.

______________________________________________________________________________
A key distinction of IRP is its acceptance of the principle that in order to accurately compare
and analyze resources, all relevant expenses for existing and new resources options must be
included in the analysis. Thus, transmission and distribution costs, environmental compliance
costs, risk and reliability impacts, and security costs are key inputs. Likewise, benefits of
resources that defer, eliminate, and reduce these costs are key inputs.
Despite widespread scaling back of utility energy efficiency programs during the 1990s, the
primary rationale for implementing energy efficiency programs – to reduce electricity costs and
lower customer bills – is just as relevant in today’s electricity industry as it has been in the past.
Consequently, demand‐side resources, and particularly energy efficiency, are an important
resource in the planning process. The essential benefit of IRP to Florida is that it will allow an
analysis of supply‐side and demand‐side resources on equal footing.
An extensive review of IRP, and the steps to implement it are available in the report “Integrated
Resource Planning for State Utility Regulators.” 27

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Florida has had a long‐range electrical resource planning process in place since 1974.28 All
investor‐owned utilities, as well as OUC and JEA, are statutorily required to file Ten‐Year Site
Plans (TYSP) with the PSC. The TYSP is an annual filing that provides a list of future generation
for the next 10 years, and the PSC acknowledges the TYSP. In addition, the PSC determines the
need for generation (75 MW of steam or solar) in a determination that is triggered by a utility’s
TYSP filing. The PSC takes into account availability of efficient and renewable generation prior
to approving the necessity of a power plant. Lastly, the power plant must go through the Power
Plant Siting Act (PPSA) process, a rigorous multiagency review that requires obtaining all

ESD-8. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Systems

Policy Description
Combined heat and power (CHP) is generally considered to refer to the use of a heat engine or a
power station to simultaneously generate electricity and useful heat. Conventional power plants
emit the heat created as a by‐product of electricity generation into the environment through
cooling towers, flue gas, or by other means. CHP systems reduce fossil fuel use and GHG
emissions through the improved efficiency of the CHP systems, relative to separate heat and
power technologies, and by avoiding transmission and distribution losses associated with
moving power from central power stations located far away from where the electricity is used.
Here CHP is defined broadly to include large‐scale projects for heat and waste heat recovery
and is intended to capture all sources of by‐product heat generation, including waste heat from
exothermic reactions when sulfuric acid is produced such as is generated in phosphate fertilizer
manufacturing.
This policy should also address the numerous barriers to CHP processes, including inadequate
information; institutional barriers; high transaction costs due to small project size, lender
unfamiliarity and perceived risk; “split incentives” between building owners and tenants; and
utility‐related policies (such as interconnection requirements, high standby rates, and exit fees).

Policy Design
Goals: Ramp up CHP to 5 million MWh of total generation by 2022. This represents about 1000
MW of additional combined heat and power. By way of comparison, a 2005 study estimated
that Florida has over 6000 MW of CHP potential, including over 5000 MW of potential
applications in the commercial/institutional sector29.
Timing: Beginning in 2012, ramp up new CHP linearly, until 5 million MWh is reached in 2022.
Parties Involved: State government and regulators, PSC, FECC, electric utilities, and renewable
energy and CHP industry.
Other: Coverage should be defined broadly to include waste heat from all sources of by‐
product heat generation, including waste heat from exothermic reactions when sulfuric acid is
produced such as that generated during phosphate fertilizer manufacturing. Coverage will
include biomass and natural gas.

Implementation Mechanisms
Potential elements of this option include:

•

Promotion of the use of gas‐fired CHP systems,

•

Promotion of the use of biomass‐fired CHP systems, and

•

Creation and expansion of markets for and incentives designed to promote implementation
of CHP units in capacities suitable for residential, commercial, and industrial users.

Specific financial incentives for CHP could include:

•

Direct subsidies for purchasing and selling CHP systems given to the buyer or seller;

•

Tax credits or exemptions for purchasing and selling CHP systems given to the buyer or
seller;

•

Tax credits or exemptions for operating CHP systems;

•

Feed‐in tariffs, which are direct payments to CHP owners for each kWh of electricity or
British thermal unit (Btu) of heat generated from a qualifying CHP system;

•

Tax credits for each kWh or Btu generated from a qualifying CHP system;

•

Targeted financing arrangements; and

•

Renewable Energy Credits.

Other supporting measures for this option include training and certification of installers and
contractors, net metering and other pricing arrangements, establishment of clear and consistent
interconnection standards, and creation and support of markets for biomass fuels.
Pricing and metering strategies can provide price signals and revenue streams to support
investment in and optimal operations of CHP systems. Net metering is a policy that allows
owners of grid‐connected DG (generating units on the customer side of the meter, often limited
to some maximum kW level) that generates excess electricity to sell it back to the grid,
effectively “turning the meter backward.” Net metering provides several incentives for
renewable DG by reducing transaction costs (e.g., no need to negotiate contracts for the sale of
electricity back to the utility) and increasing revenue by setting compensation at retail electricity
rates rather than at utility‐avoided costs. In addition to net metering, pricing strategies of
relevance to CHP and distributed renewable‐energy systems can include TOU rates. These are
fixed rates for different times of the day or for different seasons that reflect the time‐varying
value of electricity.
Policies to remove barriers can include improved interconnection policies; improved policies for
rates and fees; streamlined permitting; recognition of the emissions reduction value provided

by CHP, clean DG financing packages, and bonding programs; power procurement policies;
ability to provide power to third‐party consumers; and education and outreach.
An IRP system should be used to maximize efficient and renewable energy generation. IRP (see
option ESD‐7) could support development and installation of these technologies, if they meet
the stated objectives of the IRP process.

The quantitative analysis uses retail electricity rates as the basis for estimating the cost savings
from this option. In addition, retail natural gas prices are used in estimating the costs for
running CHP systems that use natural gas. The resulting cost‐effectiveness calculations
represent the costs from the perspective of the end‐user (commercial or industrial customer that
installs the CHP system). Costs and benefits from the perspective of other actors in Florida (for
example from the utilities that now face lower customer demand and lower need for new
generation) are excluded from this analysis. Analyzing the option using methods that include
the other actors in Florida, such as through a total resource cost perspective, will yield different
results for cost‐effectiveness.

ESD-9. Power Plant Efficiency Improvements

Policy Description
Efficiency improvements refer to increasing generation efficiency at power stations through
incremental improvements at existing plants (for example, more efficient boilers and turbines,
improved control systems, or combined cycle technology). Repowering existing plants refers to
switching to lower‐ or zero‐emitting fuels at existing plants or for new capacity additions. This
includes use of biomass or natural gas in place of coal or oil. Policies to encourage efficiency
improvements and repowering of existing plants could include incentives or regulations as
described in other options, with adjustments for financing opportunities and emissions rates of
existing plants.

Policy Design
Goals: To improve the heat rates of all existing power plants of the statewide fleet by an
average of 10% through efficiency improvements and/or fuel switching or repowering. The cost
of HB 7135 is to be included in baseline.
Timing: Improvements begin in 2012, ramping up to a 10% improvement by 2020.
Parties Involved: All power plants in the state.
Other: None

Implementation Mechanisms
An Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) system should be used to maximize efficient and
renewable energy generation. IRP (see option ESD‐7) could support development and
installation of these technologies, if they meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
HB 7135 made major revisions to FEECA. Utilities subject to the PSC’s rate‐making jurisdiction
may receive incentives for additional efficiencies. For example, an investor‐owned utility may
receive up to 50 basis points extra return on its investment, so long as that utility offsets 20% or
more of its new load growth through efficiencies to its generating and transmission facilities.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions

Costs for efficiency improvements assume that efficiency is attained through conversions that

repowering Riviera and Cape Canaveral plants, as documented by FPL in 2008. The capital
costs for these plants average approximately $1000 per final kW of repowered capacity. Though
fuel switching, either from oil products to natural gas (for which the additional potential in
Florida is fairly limited) or from coal to natural gas (with a larger theoretical potential) is
nominally a part of the option design above, the analysis of this option to date has not
specifically focused on fuel‐switching. Note that some electricity generation fuel switching is
already occurring in Florida, and additional fuel switching, at least for power plants originally
fueled with residual oil, appears to be included in the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council
(FRCC) 2008 Load and Resource Plan through 2017. Fuel switching to convert coal‐fired

generation to gas‐fired generation is likely to more closely resemble power plant replacement
than efficiency upgrades or repowering, and thus may be considered a separate analysis.
Given the somewhat limited opportunities for repowering and efficiency improvements per se,
the degree to which such measures may already be included in existing forecasts of the
operation of generating units in Florida, and the degree to which Florida utilities are already
investing in power plant energy efficiency (including taking advantage of the provisions of HB
7135, described above in “Related Policies/Programs in Place”), the current goals for this option
may be difficult to attain without some reliance on fuel‐switching.

ESD-11. Landfill Gas -to-Energy (LFGTE)

Policy Description
This policy option focuses on capture of methane gas from landfills and converting landfill gas‐
to‐energy (LFGTE) to reduce direct emissions and to produce electricity. Added policy benefits
of converting LFGTE are obviating the need for landfills and producing base‐load‐like electric
generation. Certain components of municipal waste can be used as non‐fossil combustion
resources for generating electricity. This option could be structured as either a mandate or an
incentive program.

Policy Design
Goals: 90% of qualifying landfills in Florida that do not already capture landfill gas and convert
it to energy (or sell the gas to a utility for conversion to energy) are doing so by 2025.
Timing: First landfill converted by 2012; by 2025, 90% of all qualifying landfills in the state will
be capturing their CH4 emissions and using or selling the gas for energy.
Parties Involved: Municipal and county governments, private solid waste management
companies, local economic development agencies, FECC, state regulatory agencies, PSC,
nongovernment organizations, and public interest groups.
Other: Coverage should extend beyond utilities.

Implementation Mechanisms
An IRP system should be used to maximize efficient and renewable energy generation. IRP (see
option ESD‐7) could support development and installation of these technologies, if they meet
the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Florida defines these technologies as renewable and has a production tax credit of $0.01/kWh
currently in place. The program is capped at a total of $5 million. In 2007, Florida did not reach
the cap.

ESD-12. Demand-Side Management (DSM)/Energy Efficiency Programs,
Funds, or Goals for Electricity

Policy Description
DSM/energy efficiency programs, funds, or goals for electricity entail actions that influence the
quantity and/or patterns of use of energy consumed by end users. This option focuses on
increasing investment in electricity DSM/energy efficiency through programs run by utilities or
others, energy efficiency funds, and energy efficiency goals. These options may be designed to
work in tandem with other strategies that encourage efficiency gains. For this option, DSM
refers to programs implemented by utilities with the objective of reducing electricity
consumption. Historically, Florida DSM programs have focused more on peak power demand
savings than on electricity savings; thus this option represents a shift in the objectives and
therefore application of DSM by Florida utilities.

Policy Design
The policy design includes two key and linked dimensions: achievable/desirable energy savings
and policy/administrative mechanisms to achieve these savings.
Goals: In each sector—residential, commercial, and industrial—reduce electricity consumption
relative to consumption in the prior year by 1.0% per year through 2012, then by 1.5% per year
through 2015, and then 2.0% per year thereafter through 2030.
For the analysis below, the goal is being interpreted such that 1% of projected (forecast) retail
electricity sales are saved per year starting in 2012, reaching 1.5% per year by 2015, and 2% per
year by 2020. Note that these are annual new savings in each year, not cumulative savings
including results from previous years of the program. The total estimated savings and costs
reflect cumulative savings from all program years, adjusted to account for the lifetime of
program measures.
Timing: 2010 is the first year of compliance.
Parties Involved: All electric utilities (public and private), regulators, municipal utilities and
cooperatives, and customers (all sectors).
Other: none cited

Implementation Mechanisms
This electricity savings that are used as goals for this option imply that the energy efficiency
programs will need a strong focus on energy savings (as opposed to peak power demand
savings). Policy and administrative mechanisms that might be applied include regulator‐
verified savings targets, public benefit charges, portfolio standards, “energy trusts,” IRP,
A‐44
Appendix A

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
performance‐based incentives, decoupling of rates and revenues, and appropriate rate
treatment for efficiency. Potential mechanisms include revising existing statutes to enable utility
investments in energy efficiency at the levels indicated above and to consider as potentially
eligible programs that are cost‐effective, taking into account the valuation of carbon dioxide
emissions.
Elements that might be considered in designing this option include:

•

Implementation and administration by utility (including municipal utilities and
cooperatives), state agency, or third‐party actors;

•

Subsidized energy audits for homeowners, businesses, industries;

•

Incentives for specific technologies, potentially including lighting, water heating, plug
loads, networked personal computer management, power supplies, motors, pumps, boilers,
customer‐side transformers, water‐use reduction, ground‐source heat pumps, and others;
and

•

Energy efficiency reinvestment funds.

This policy may be broad in focus, or it can focus on specific market segments. Complementary
policies include appliance recycling and pickup programs. Measures supporting this option
might include consumer education, performance contracting, and energy end‐use surveys.
An IRP system should be used to maximize efficient and renewable energy generation. IRP (see
option ESD‐7) could support development and installation of these technologies and initiatives,
if they meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
FEECA places emphasis on reducing the growth rates of weather‐sensitive peak demand,
reducing and controlling the growth rates of electricity consumption, and reducing the
consumption of scarce resources such as petroleum fuels. The PSC has adopted rules requiring
those electric utilities that are subject to FEECA to implement cost‐effective DSM programs.
Section 366.82(4), Florida Statutes, directs the commission to provide an annual report to the
Legislature and the Governor with the DSM goals it has adopted under FEECA and the
progress it has made toward meeting these goals. Section 553.975, Florida Statutes, requires the
commission to prepare a biennial report on the savings derived from the efficiency standards
for lighting equipment, showerheads, and refrigerators enumerated in Section 553.963, Florida
Statutes—the Energy Conservation Standards Act.
Data included in the FRCC 2008 Regional Load and Resource Plan suggest that expected utility
energy efficiency programs will yield approximately 230 to 300 additional GWh of electricity
savings per year from 2009 through 2016, an increment of about 0.1 percent of total retail sales

annually30. A presentation at a Florida Public Service Commission Workshop on Energy
Efficiency Initiatives (November 29, 2007) by several officials of Florida utilities reported
expected savings at similar, though slightly lower, levels31.
A quantitative estimate of the savings implied by existing and planned Utility DSM programs,
based on data like those above, will be prepared as a “recent actions” contribution to GHG
emissions reduction. It is expected that the emissions reductions shown by these programs will
be on the order of one tenth of the emissions reductions indicated below for ESD‐12.

ESD-13a. Energy Efficiency in Existing Residential Buildings

Policy Description
In 2005 Florida’s population was just under 18 million with approximately 7.13 million
households. With over 50% of electricity used in homes, focusing attention on energy efficiency
improvements to the existing residential home sector has the potential to provide the greatest
reduction in electricity usage and associated GHG emissions. Incentives should focus on
existing residential buildings.

Policy Design
Goals: Measures implemented with low‐interest loans will reduce energy consumption in
existing homes by a target percentage each year relative to consumption in the prior year (with
a baseline to be established against which actual performance would be measured).
Quantification analysis below is based on energy efficiency measures being implemented
starting with 1% of housing units per year in 2011 increasing to 4% of housing units per year in
2015, with each unit reducing energy consumption by 39% on average.
Timing: 10‐year program from January 1, 2011, through 2020, with results tracked annually
from 2011 through 2030.
Parties Involved: Cities and counties; utilities; building contractors; remodelers; building
designers; architects; engineers; retailers of energy‐efficient products; manufacturers of
alternative building products; social service organizations, including clubs and religious
organizations; FECC; DEP; and the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA).
Other: Eligible technologies are to be determined.

Implementation Mechanisms
•

Improving energy efficiency in low‐income units can provide some of the most cost‐
effective energy savings in the residential sector. Facilitating access to existing grants and
providing new low‐ or zero‐interest energy efficiency loans can be effective mechanisms
through which to realize those savings. These low‐interest loans can often be facilitated
through traditional lending mechanisms,37 as well as through specially designated funds. In
a broader loan program, target loans toward areas that are compatible with desired low‐
carbon land‐use patterns.

For instance, see the Nebraska Dollar Energy Saving Loans, through which the Nebraska State Energy Office
purchases half of each energy efficiency loan at a 0% interest rate so that the total interest paid by the borrower is half
the market rate.

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Encourage and reward alternative business models aimed at increasing efficiency in the
marketplace. For example, the creation of Energy Service Companies (ESCO) in the
residential retrofit arena should be promoted as a finance mechanism for home energy‐
efficient retrofits.

•

Implement a net metering program modeled after the successful German solar experience.

•

Explore incentives to induce owners and remodeling contractors to improve energy
efficiency in existing residential buildings. An initial action that can be taken as a way to
“measure” gains in residential buildings would be to establish and maintain an energy
consumption baseline by community or region for existing homes. Meaningful benchmarks
for community building performance could be established using that baseline. In addition,
residential owners and remodelers could use that community baseline to compare with their
usage.

On an individual home basis, utilities could be encouraged to establish and provide energy
consumption histories for existing residences against which meaningful benchmarks for
individual households could be established. It may be possible to use the energy histories to
link incentives to measured performance improvements, such as CO2 emissions avoided.

•

Make available history review services and associated energy audits for individual
household energy consumption to establish benchmarks for household CO2 emissions
avoidance.

•

Design and offer incentives modeled on performance contracting with incentives linked to
energy use reductions and associated CO2 emissions avoided. Incentives may be in the form
of tax credits, DSM program support, “green mortgages,” and others.

•

Provide DSM incentives for compliance with improved design and construction
certifications (such as the EPA’s ENERGY STAR appliance and product programs and other
standards). Since these certifications do not guarantee actual performance at the meter,
incentives may be linked to demonstrated performance over time (e.g., as a rebate after one
year of demonstrated performance), rather than when a certificate is awarded.

•

Develop windstorm resistant features; indoor air quality standards; construction waste
management; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC); and lighting standards
including energy efficiency and occupant health and safety to complement energy efficiency
codes.

•

Maintain the Florida energy code to require upgrades to building envelope components and
energy using equipment efficiencies at cost‐effective levels when major renovations and
equipment replacement are undertaken.

ESD-14. Improved Building Codes for Energy Efficiency

Policy Description
Buildings are significant consumers of energy and other resources. Building energy codes can
be an effective way to eliminate the least efficient energy approaches in new or renovated
buildings. This policy sets a goal for reducing building energy consumption to be achieved by
increasing standards for the minimum performance of new and substantially renovated
commercial and residential buildings through the adoption and enforcement of building codes.
Building codes would be made more stringent via incorporation of aspects of advanced or next‐
generation building designs and construction standards, such as sustainable design and green
building standards.

Policy Design
Goals: HB 697 and HB 7135 call for the energy efficiency requirements of the Florida Energy
Efficiency Code to be incrementally scaled up to 50% higher than the 2007 Code by 2019. The
goal of ESD‐14 is to extend the time frame of HB 697 and HB 7135 beyond 2019 such that energy
consumption per square foot of floor space is reduced by 100% from what it was in 2007.
The quantitative analysis assumes that increase in code stringency continues at the rate
specified in HB 697, 50% improvement in 2019, followed by 60% improvement in 2022, and 70%
in 2026.
TWG members noted that calling for building codes to reach 100% reduction in energy
consumption is equivalent to a 50% reduction in total building electricity demand since the
building codes only reach about 50% of the electricity consumed in a building. An alternative
suggestion for wording is “extend the time frame and (potentially) activity coverage of HB 697
and HB 7135 beyond 2019 and to additional end‐uses of electricity such that total energy
consumption per square foot of floor space is reduced by 50% from what it was in 2007.”
Timing: Operational in 2010.
Parties Involved: Florida Building Commission (FBC), DCA, and FECC.
Other: None

Implementation Mechanisms
Potential elements of a building code policy include the following:

•

Require high‐efficiency appliances in retrofits.

•

Train building code and other officials in energy code enforcement.

A‐54
Appendix A

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Include potential measures supporting this option such as consumer education, improved
enforcement of building codes, training for builders and contractors, and development of a
clearinghouse for information on and to provide access to software tools to calculate the
impact of energy efficiency and solar technologies on building energy performance.

•

Encourage home owners and home buyers to have a home energy rating performed on the
home.

•

Require white roofs, rooftop gardens, and landscaping (including shade tree programs).

•

Provide incentives for white roofs, rooftop gardens, and landscaping, which can lower
electricity demand. High summer roof temperatures increase the need for more electricity
for air conditioning, and they produce black carbon (BC) from updrafts.

•

Promote installation of ductwork and air handlers inside conditioned spaces to reduce the
energy costs associated with conduction and leakage (approximately half of the energy
demand in Florida’s homes is for heating and cooling; air handlers are generally in garages
or attic spaces; ductwork is uniformly in attic spaces and exposed to extremes in
temperature).

•

Create an educational tool for builders that includes the costs and benefits of new and
emerging cost‐effective technologies for Florida‐specific conditions. Such a tool could
catalog the costs (including CO2) and benefits of less commonly used technologies and
provide suggestions for innovation that result in lower energy use and help a residence
meet the energy code. Some example technologies are insulated concrete forms (which are
also excellent in wind load situations), innovative ways to get ducts and air handlers inside
conditioned space, designs to keep hot water plumbing central, heat rejection strategies like
radiant barriers and low‐E glass, and techniques to insulate the outside of concrete block
homes. To develop the tool, consult innovative builders and building scientists (who have
the numbers) to brainstorm new ways to make residences in Florida more energy efficient
and then develop a tool that would describe those technologies and provide information
about energy savings (and their code impacts) and cost to implement the technologies.
Include these technologies in the energy code compliance computer program.

•

Identify all barriers to improved efficiency in existing homes and buildings, and implement
government programs and policies to overcome these barriers.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Florida Legislature recently passed legislation that sets new energy efficiency standards for
the building code. The 2008 Florida Energy Bill HB 7135 directs the FBC to select the most recent
International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) as a foundation code. HB 697 targets a 20%
increase in building code energy efficiency standards from 2007 levels by 2010. Furthermore,
HB 697 and HB 7135 call for the energy efficiency requirements of the Florida Energy Efficiency
Code to be incrementally scaled up to 50% higher than requirements in the 2007 Code by 2019.

A‐55
Appendix A

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
There is a mandatory review of codes every 3 years to ensure that state and local building codes
relating to energy efficiency requirements are always as strict as the more stringent of the IECC
or American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air‐Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)
standards.
Prior to implementing the goals established in the Florida Energy Efficiency Code for Building
Construction, the FBC should adopt by rule and implement a cost‐effectiveness test for
proposed increases in energy efficiency. This test shall measure cost‐effectiveness and ensure
that energy efficiency increases result in a positive net financial impact.

ESD-15. Training and Education for Building Operators and
Community Association Managers

Policy Description
Energy Management Training/Training of Building Operators. Energy Management Training
provides administrative and technical training for energy managers, school officials, building
operators, and others responsible for energy‐efficient facility operation. This policy could
include:

•

Training commercial building energy managers, for example, by making use of the building
operator training and certification program developed in the Pacific Northwest;

•

Training industrial energy and facility managers in techniques for improving the efficiency
of their steam, process heat, pumping, compressed air, motors, and other systems, perhaps
dovetailing with the US DOE in this area; and

•

Creation of a credentialing program for certification of “green” energy managers that
requires both training and examinations to qualify.

Policy Design

ESD-17. Consumer Education Programs

Policy Description
In many cases, the ultimate effectiveness of emissions reduction activities depends on providing
information and education to consumers regarding the energy and GHG emissions implications
of their choices. Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a broad awareness of climate
change issues and effects (including co‐benefits, such as clean air and public health) among the
state’s citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in actions to reduce GHG
emissions in their personal and professional lives. Public education and outreach efforts should
integrate with and build on existing outreach efforts involving climate change and related
issues in the state. Ultimately, public education and outreach will be the foundation for the
long‐term success of all of the mitigation actions proposed by the Action Team, as well as those
that may evolve in the future.

•

Institute mandatory labeling programs for time‐of‐sale (TOS) energy use for all consumer
products, devices, and systems (including all buildings) that can be evaluated by either
testing or computer simulation, and educate consumers on the use and implications of these
labels.

•

Create a public inquiry “information center” where those who are interested can obtain
factual answers (vetted by experts in the field) to common energy‐efficiency and GHG
questions.

•

Provide public education materials and energy information collateral that can be used at
local levels by minimally trained speakers.

•

Create an awards program that recognizes businesses and individuals who exhibit
exemplary behavior or performance with respect to local energy and climate public
education programs or in local GHG or energy use reduction programs.

•

Provide state‐sponsored Public Service Announcement (PSA) programs.

Policy Design
Goals: Not quantified. Goals for consumer education are quantifiable, and have been quantified
by some utilities. Such quantification was not carried out for this process, due to limited
resources.
Timing: Begin outreach programs in 2010.
Parties Involved: FECC, consumers, retailers, manufacturers, K‐12 public schools, community
colleges, universities, and the Florida DOE.

ESD-23. Decoupling

Policy Description
Traditional regulatory frameworks tie a utility’s recovery of fixed costs of providing service (for
example, infrastructure costs) to the quantity of energy sold. Thus, there is a perverse incentive
for utilities to increase sales in order to boost revenues and minimize investments in energy
efficiency (which will simply lead to lower than anticipated sales). This option includes the
implementation of cost recovery rules that “decouple” the level of utility sales from net
revenues earned by investor‐owned utilities.
Implement rate structures and utility cost‐recovery rules that decouple the level of gas and
electric utility sales from the net revenues earned by utilities. Decoupling should be geared
exclusively to removing barriers to utility investment in programs to increase their customers’
energy efficiency and reduce customer loads. Decoupling mechanisms should be carefully
designed in order to avoid, as much as possible, adverse economic impacts on ratepayers so
that factors other than energy efficiency investments (for example, economic downturns) do not
adversely affect rates, and to ensure that the decoupling mechanism is fair to consumers and
shareholders.

Policy Design
Goals: Not quantifiable; the resulting declines in energy use will be tied more directly to utility
DSM programs (ESD‐12 and ESD‐22) that should be more successful because of decoupling.
Timing: New regulatory framework in place by January 1, 2010.
Parties Involved: Florida utilities and the PSC.
Other: None

Implementation Mechanisms
The PSC has been tasked by HB 7135 to analyze utility revenue decoupling and provide a
recommendation and report to the Governor, President of the Senate and Speaker of the House
of Representatives by January 1, 2009.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
During the 2008 legislative session, the Legislature passed and Governor Crist signed HB 7135,
which ordered the PSC to analyze utility revenue decoupling and provide a report and
recommendation to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of
Representatives by January 1, 2009. The PSC began holding workshops on this in early August
2008.

Tier 2 Options
The Action Team noted the importance of all options but the focus for analysis, and subsequent
recommendations, was on Tier 1 options. The information that follows describes the proposed
Tier 2 options as developed by the ESD TWG, but the information was not reviewed by the
Action Team.

ESD-1. Technology Research & Development (R&D) With
Commercial Opportunities

Policy Description
The State of Florida is committed to a leadership role in commercializing new energy
technologies to reduce the state’s carbon footprint and to reap benefits for the state’s economy.
Toward these ends, public and private funding will be mobilized and targeted to support
research and development (R&D) of emerging energy technologies. This policy should be seen
as enabling and supporting other energy supply and demand (ESD) policies and should target
supply‐ and demand‐side opportunities.
R&D funding can be targeted toward a particular technology or group of technologies as part of
a state initiative to build an industry around that technology in the state and to set the stage for
use of the technology in the state. For example, an agency could be established to develop and
deploy energy storage technologies.
R&D funding can be made available to any renewable energy or other advanced technology
through an open bidding procedure (driven by bids received rather than by a focused strategy
to develop a particular technology). Funding can also be given for demonstration projects to
help commercialize technologies that have already been developed but are not yet in
widespread use. This funding will eventually lead to commercialization of reasonable cost
generation technologies with low or zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Finally, funding can
be targeted to increase collaboration among existing institutions in the state for R&D.

Policy Design
Goals: Achieve 15% emissions reductions from investments in clean and renewable
technologies. Establish scenarios for near and long‐term technologies and determine which
technologies are eligible under each of these categories. Intended to be additive.
Timing: 5% reduction achieved by 2015, 10% by 2020, 15% by 2025.
Parties Involved: Universities, private sector, state agencies, and local governments.
Other: Technologies utilizing tidal, wave, ocean, wind, and solar energy and biofuels are
eligible, among others to be identified.

A‐65
Appendix A

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
As for longer‐term technologies, those that require significant cost developments include carbon
capture and storage (for example, in deep saline aquifers or coal seams) for fossil fuel facilities,
large‐scale infrastructure for base‐load renewable energy, and technologies that can transform
intermittent renewables into base‐load generation (for example, batteries, hydrogen, and
compressed air storage). Some of the technologies noted in “other,” above, including
generation of electricity from ocean energy (which would tap the Gulf Stream off Florida’s
coast), have considerable potential, but likewise will require a significant research and
development effort to overcome technical and economic obstacles to deployment.

Implementation Mechanisms
Given the magnitude of the task, an Apollo‐like research program to create and field‐test such
technologies that are or have high potential to become commercially viable is needed. Presently,
such funding is not a significant portion of a rate‐regulated utility’s budget or the budgets of
federal and state government agencies. However, even a small fee per kilowatt‐hour (kWh) of
electricity could generate significant funding, but funding is only half the equation, and
strategies to use such funds to implement a focused program to commercialize generation
technologies with low or zero GHG emissions must also be developed.

•

Establish an agency or program to support strategic development and deployment of new
renewable energy technologies.

•

Establish funding mechanisms, for example, a small fee per kWh of electricity.

•

Identify mechanisms to encourage private capital investment.

•

Establish parameters for eligible projects (for example, 25% or 50% of project financing).

•

Link with local government efforts (note existing relationships with biotechnology firms as
an example).

•

Evaluate and update funding and financing mechanisms at regular intervals.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Since 2006, Florida has provided financial incentives through sales tax deductions, tax credits,
and a robust grant program that has funded renewable technologies such as wind, solar, and
bioenergy. Further building on this initiative, HB 7135 pushed R&D to a new level with the
creation of the Florida Energy Systems Consortium (FESC). This consortium comprises
numerous Florida universities that research a variety of renewable technologies, including
cellulosic ethanol, solar energy, and ocean energy. This consortium received $50 million to
advanced renewable technologies. In addition, Florida universities and state government enjoy
many partnerships with private industries. The programs below total $84 million:

•

Solar rebate program ($5 million),

•

Sales tax deductions for hydrogen and biofuels ($3 million),

A‐66

•

Corporate investment tax credits for hydrogen and biofuels ($11 million),

•

Renewable energy and efficiency grant program ($7 million),

•

Farm‐to‐Fuel ($8 million), and

•

FESC ($50 million).

The Florida Legislature has recently provided additional funding for research and development
on a range of renewable energy options, including the generation of electricity from ocean
energy.

Additional Benefits and Costs
ESD‐1 creates co‐benefits in the areas of economic development and fuel diversity.
In the past year, over 4,000 megawatts (MW) of coal have been removed from Florida’s fuel
forecast and will likely be replaced largely by natural gas. Florida is already top‐heavy in terms
of its use of natural gas to supply electricity. Florida’s long‐term strategy may require a large
increase of nuclear generation. However, due to the lead time of permitting and construction,
Florida can diversify its fuel portfolio more quickly through implementation of renewable
generation.
The issue of job creation in clean energy industries is of great interest to states. Although
numerical estimates vary, clean energy may create significantly more jobs than fossil energy per
dollar invested. In a 2001 study, the Renewable Energy Policy Project (REPP) calculated that
wind and solar energy produce 40% more jobs per dollar than coal. A 2004 study by the
Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory (RAEL) found that investment in renewable
energy created three to five times as many jobs as the same investment in fossil‐fuel energy
systems (http://www.nga.org/Files/pdf/0807ENERGYRD.PDF)

ESD-4. Electricity Transmission and Distribution Improvements

Policy Description
Measures to improve transmission systems to reduce bottlenecks and enhance throughput may
be required to satisfy long‐term electricity demands and improve the energy efficiency of
operations system‐wide. Opportunities may exist to substantially increase transmission‐line
carrying capacity through the implementation of new construction and retrofit activities on the
transmission grid, including incorporating advanced composite‐conductor technologies,
capacitance technologies, and grid management software.
To increase efficiency, new generation must be closer to load. Siting new transmission lines can
be a difficult process given their cost and their local impact on the environment, and on the use,
enjoyment, and value of property. Policy measures in support of this option could provide
incentives to utilities to upgrade transmission systems and reduce barriers to siting of new
transmission lines. It should also consider the incorporation of demand response systems and
smart grid technologies.

Policy Design
Goals: Reduce system‐wide losses from transmission, generation, and distribution by an
average of 5% of total energy delivered across Florida by 2018.
Timing: Phase in beginning in 2011, with the goal achieved by 2018.
Parties Involved: FECC, Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Florida Public
Service Commission (PSC), and possibly Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC).
Other: Coverage of renewable energy sources.

Implementation Mechanisms
There are several energy efficiency measures that can be implemented to reduce the
transmission and distribution line losses of electricity. Utilities use a variety of components
throughout the transmission and distribution system to manage losses. Increasing the efficiency
of these components can further reduce losses and associated GHG emissions. For example, the
State of Vermont offers a rebate to encourage the installation of energy‐efficient transformers.
Regulations, incentives, and support programs can be applied to achieve greater efficiency of
transmission and distribution system components.

•

Create incentive program to encourage capital investments.

•

An IRP system should be used to maximize efficient and renewable energy generation. IRP
(see option ESD‐7) could support development and installation of these technologies, if they
meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
The PSC places emphasis on reducing the growth rates of weather‐sensitive peak demand,
reducing and controlling the growth rates of electricity consumption, and reducing the
consumption of scarce resources such as petroleum fuels. The PSC has adopted rules requiring
those electric utilities that are subject to Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act
(FEECA) to implement demand‐side management (DSM) programs that are cost‐effective.
Section 366.82(4), Florida Statutes, directs the commission to provide an annual report to the
Legislature and the Governor with the DSM goals it has adopted under FEECA and the
progress toward meeting these goals.
HB 7135 (2008) made major revisions to FEECA. Utilities subject to the PSC’s rate‐making
jurisdiction may receive incentives for additional efficiencies to generating facilities,
transmission, and DSM programs. For example, an investor‐owned utility (IOU) may receive up
to 50 basis points return on its investment if that utility offsets 20% or more of its new load
growth through efficiencies. These efficiencies apply to the supply side and the demand side of
the equation. Further, the new legislation streamlines the siting of transmission associated with
nuclear generation by allowing access to Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) right‐of‐
ways and state lands. In addition, utilities can receive advanced cost recovery for transmission
lines directly associated with a nuclear facility or relocation of transmission as a result of a new
nuclear facility.

ESD-13b. Incentives for New Residential Buildings and Master Planned
Communities Achieving High-Energy Performance Standards

Policy Description
Provide incentives to induce building contractors to improve resource and energy efficiency in
new residential buildings and master planned residential communities. This option is focused
on encouraging developers and builders to significantly exceed building code requirements and
incorporate high‐energy performance considerations in community design.
Over the last decade more than one million new homes were built in Florida. The majority were
in master planned community developments, which are uniquely well equipped to integrate
energy efficiency into community designs and housing standards. Master planned community
developments also strongly influence ongoing community operations and standards through
their organizational design of Home Owner Associations (HOA), or Community Development
Districts, and through explicit language in recorded Conditions, Covenants, and Restrictions
(CC&R).

Policy Design
Goals: Energy efficiency in a yet‐to‐be‐determined fraction of new homes and planned
communities will be 10% higher than that required by building codes by 2015.
Timing: For new homes, ramp up efficiency improvements above code, beginning with 2% in
2010 (21% more stringent than the 2007 Florida Building Code) to 10 % in 2015 (37% more
stringent than the 2007 FBC38).
Parties Involved: Building contractors, building designers, architects, engineers, developers,
retailers of energy‐efficient products, manufacturers of alternative building products, utilities to
administer benchmark program for CO2 emissions avoidance, and the FECC.
Other: None

Implementation Mechanisms
•

Provide incentives modeled on performance contracting with incentives linked to CO2
emissions avoided. Incentives can be in the form of tax credits, DSM program support,
green mortgages, and others.

•

Establish minimum performance standards (e.g., all homes shall be ENERGY STAR–
qualified) that affect thousands of homes and strongly influence local standards of product
performance and tradecraft.

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Provide incentives to induce developers to improve resource and energy efficiency in new
master planned residential communities. Establish and maintain “local” energy
consumption baselines for newly built houses against which meaningful benchmarks for
building performance can be established. Use energy tracking to link incentives to measured
performance in terms of CO2 emissions avoided. Establish protocols that warrant and allow
for the sale of CO2 emissions avoided.

•

Provide incentives modeled on performance contracting that are linked to CO2 emissions
avoided. Incentives linked to explicit requirements in the community’s legally recorded
organizational documents can be in the form of faster permitting, density bonuses, tax
credits, community‐scale DSM program support, green mortgages, and others.

•

Provide incentives for required compliance with improved community design and
construction certifications, such as U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design Green Building Rating System™ for Neighborhood Development
(LEED‐ND), Florida Green Building Coalition Green Development Standard, Audubon
International’s Gold Signature program, and others. Since these certifications do not
guarantee actual performance at the meter, incentives should be partially linked to
demonstrated performance over time (for example, as a rebate after a year of demonstrated
performance), rather than when a certificate is awarded. Furthermore, the value of
certifications should be judged against meaningful benchmarks based on community
consumption standards developed for similar classes of homes.

•

Support local government initiatives to provide incentives for green building.

•

Update and integrate the Florida Building Energy Rating System into national programs,
and coordinate with the Florida Building Code.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Prior to implementing the goals established in the Florida Energy Efficiency Code for Building
Construction, the Florida Building Commission is required by HB 7135 to adopt by rule and
implement a cost‐effectiveness test for proposed increases in energy efficiency. This test shall
measure cost‐effectiveness and ensure that energy efficiency increases result in a positive net
financial impact.

ESD-16. More Stringent Appliance/Equipment Efficiency Standards

Policy Description
Appliance efficiency standards reduce the market cost of energy efficiency improvements by
incorporating technological advances into base appliance models, thereby creating economies of
scale. Appliance efficiency standards can be implemented at the state level for appliances not
covered by federal standards, or standards can be jointly developed by multiple states.
Electrical appliances span all sectors and may include refrigerators, freezers, dishwashers,
stoves, ovens, clothes washers and dryers, room air conditioners, and pool heaters.

Policy Design
Goals: In the residential sector, reduce the energy used by appliances by an additional 1.0%
every year (relative to consumption in the prior year) from 2010 through 2030. In the
commercial and industrial sectors, reduce the energy used by appliances by an additional 0.5%
every year (relative to consumption in the prior year) from 2010 through 2030.
Timing: Standards effective January 1, 2010.
Parties Involved: State government agencies, including the Department of Community Affairs,
the Florida Energy and Climate Commission (FECC), the Department of Environmental
Protection (DEP), the Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development (OTTED),
Enterprise Florida, Workforce Florida, Inc, the Department of Revenue (DOR), and the Florida
Building Commission, as well as appliance manufacturers and appliance/equipment industry
representatives.
Other: None

Implementation Mechanisms
To ensure that appliances purchased in Florida maximize the cost‐effective potential for energy
efficiency and minimize GHG emissions, the following policy prescriptions should be
considered:

•

Improve appliance standards for appliances not regulated by federal standards.

•

Lobby for more stringent appliance standards at the federal level. Require the preferential
procurement of ENERGY STAR products if available (for example, equipment, appliance, or
technology) if state funds are involved (for example, state purchasing contracts, state grants,
or loans).

•

Provide exemptions from Florida state sales tax, whether temporary or permanent, for
ENERGY STAR‐certified products.

A‐75
Appendix A

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Establish and enforce higher than federal‐ and state‐level appliance and equipment
standards (or standards for devices not covered by federal standards).

•

Join with other states in adopting higher standards.

•

Require high‐efficiency appliances in new construction and retrofits.

•

Require uniform labeling standards for appliances.

•

Set state minimum efficiency standards for appliances not covered by federal standards, as
recommended by Appliance Standards Awareness Program (ASAP),39 by 2010.

•

Double the market penetration of ENERGY STAR appliances in purchases made in the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, where applicable, up to 100%, by 2015.

Consumer education is a potential supporting measure for this option.

ESD-18. Incentives to Promote Implementation of Customer-Sited
Renewable Energy Systems

Policy Description
Distributed electricity generation sited at residences, commercial, and industrial facilities, and
powered by renewable energy sources (typically solar, but also wind, small hydroelectric power
sources, or fuels derived from waste biomass) displaces fossil‐fueled generation and avoids
electricity transmission and distribution losses, thus reducing GHG emissions. This policy can
also encourage consumers to switch from using fossil fuels to using renewable fuels in
applications such as water, process, and space heating and to provide new energy services
using fuels that produce low or no GHG emissions.

Policy Design
Goals: 200,000 MWh of customer‐sited renewable energy systems added by 2021.
Timing: 20,000 MWh40 added every year from 2012 through 2021, for a cumulative amount by
the end of 2021 of 200,000 MWh.
Parties Involved: All power producers operating qualifying renewable facilities at residences
and commercial and industrial facilities in Florida and the FECC.
Other: None cited.

Implementation Mechanisms
Increasing the use of distributed renewable energy applications in homes, businesses, and
institutions in Florida can be achieved through a combination of regulatory changes and
financial incentives to overcome barriers posed by high up‐front costs and other aspects of
distributed renewable energy systems, in order to promote stronger market for Florida.
Potential elements of this option include:

•

Programs targeted at specific customer sectors (residential, commercial, and industrial), or
specific markets within sectors.

•

Tax credits and utility or other incentives to lower the first cost of distributed energy
systems to users.

•

Rewarding innovative financing mechanisms and business models dedicated to fostering
the growth of renewable energy implementation.

20,000 MWh is 5.4 MW using a capacity factor of 42%, which is based on the simple average of 30% for wind, 20%
for solar PV, 37% for solar thermal, and 80% for biomass gasification and municipal solid waste. Geothermal is not
included due to the lack of geothermal potential in Florida.

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Provision of subsidies to renewable energy generators at $0.005/kWh for each kWh of
electricity generated from a qualifying renewable facility.

•

Training and certification of installers and contractors.

•

German‐style net metering and other pricing arrangements. Allow third‐party systems for
renewable power production that are located on user facilities to be eligible for net
metering.

•

Creation of interconnection standards.

•

Creation and support of markets for biomass fuels.

Examples of customer‐sited renewable energy systems include:

•

Solar roofs, such as roofing materials with built‐in solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, or solar PV
panels erected on roofs.

•

Solar water heating and solar space heating systems.

•

Wind power systems, particularly for rural areas.

•

Generation, space, or water heating systems fueled by waste biomass.

IRP (see option ESD‐7) could support development and installation of these technologies, if
they meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
FECC oversees Florida’s renewable energy grant program, which has resulted in a 1‐MW solar
system that is the largest in the Southeast, among other projects. In addition, the FECC
administers a solar rebate program ($5 million). This program provides $500 per residential
solar hot‐water heater, and $4 per watt for PV (up to a cap of $20,000 for residences and
$100,000 for commercial establishments). Rebates are released on a first‐come, first‐served basis.
As discussed above, the PSC recently approved tariffs to expedite interconnection for its net
metering program. Various utilities provide rebates for solar applications as well as geothermal
pumps and cool roofs, among others. For more information see:

ESD-21. Rate Structures and Technologies to Promote Reduced
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions

Policy Description
Option 1—TOU rates typically price electricity higher at times of greater power demand and
thus better reflect the actual cost of generation. TOU rates may or may not have a significant
impact on total GHG emissions, but they do affect on‐peak power demand and thus both the
need for peaking capacity and fuel for peaking plants. Consider pilot programs with real‐time
pricing that are coupled with “smart‐grid” concepts and strategies, including plug‐in hybrid
vehicle management.
Option 2—Tiered (increasing block) rates for electricity and natural gas use provide affordable
rates for base usage for consumers but rise with increasing consumption, thus providing a built‐
in rate incentive for energy conservation and energy efficiency.

Policy Design
Goals: Not established as part of this process.
Timing: New rate structure will begin on January 1, 2010.
Implementing Parties: All Florida utilities, utility customers, and the PSC.
Other: None cited.

Implementation Mechanisms
IRP (see option ESD‐7) could support development and installation of these rate structures and
technologies, if they meet the stated objectives of the IRP process.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
According to the PSC, all the investor‐owned utilities (FPL, PEF, TECO Energy, Gulf Power,
and Florida public utilities) offer TOU rates. Most of these offerings are for the commercial
sector, but FPL, PEF, and Gulf Power have tiered rate structures for the residential sector as
well.

ESD-22. Demand-Side Management (DSM)/Energy Efficiency Programs,
Funds, or Goals for Natural Gas

Policy Description
This option has most of the same attributes and options for design elements and
implementation as ESD‐12, but it focuses on increasing investment in DSM programs related to
the use of natural gas, propane or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and fuel oil through programs
run by utilities or others, energy efficiency funds, and energy efficiency goals.

Policy Design
Goals: In each sector—residential, commercial, and industrial—reduce the consumption of
natural gas, relative to consumption in the prior year, by 1.0% per year through 2012, then by
1.5% per year through 2015, and then 2.0% per year thereafter through 2030.
Timing: 2010 is the first year of compliance.
Parties Involved: All natural gas utilities (public and private), regulators, and customers (all
sectors).
Other: none citied

NOTES AND DATA FROM SOURCES
Note 1:
ACEEE June 2007. Potential for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to meet Florida’s Growing Energy Demands
Note 2:
Florida specific power plant data are available from the Florida Public Service Commission’s (the Commission) website. The data were
submitted to the Commission by various stakeholders in response to the Commission’s data request resulting from a renewable
portfolio standard (RPS) workshop held on July 11, 2008. The purpose of the questionnaire was to provide the Commission with cost
and technical potential information of renewable energy technologies within the state of Florida. Section 366.92(3)(a) of Florida Statutes
directs the Commission to evaluate the current and forecasted installed capacity and levelized cost for each renewable energy
generation method through 2020 as part of developing RPS requirements for the state. Both regulated electric utilities and interested
parties were invited to provide information to the Commission. Completed questionnaires are available on the Commission website.

Goals
From FL ESD Policy Options, ESD-11 Waste to Energy - 90% of qualifying landfills in Florida that do not
already capture landfill gas and convert it to energy (or sell the gas to a utility for conversion to energy)
are doing so by 2025.First landfill converted by 2012; by 2025, 90% of all qualifying landfills .

Assumptions taken from AFW TWG analysis of option AFW-4. The goals for AFW-4 lead to increasing
the amount of landfill gas capture to a total of 50% of total landfill gas generated in Florida. Analysts for
AFW estimate that this goal is very close to the "90% of qualifying landfills." Further information from
AFW Policy descriptions.

For preliminary estimates, use ACEEE value for 2023 and use the residential calculations to provide an estimate of savings in prior and
subsequent years. Assuming the commercial savings in ACEEE report represent similar level of improvement as the residential savings.

New Option - ESD 14

According to the Policy Design "The goal of ESD-14 is to extend the timeframe of HB 697 and 7135 beyond 2019
such that energy consumption per square foot of floor space is reduced by 100% from what it was in 2007".
Assume that 'this target continues to advance by 10% every three years to meet the 100% goal by 2035
so that improvement by 2026 is 70% better than 2007. See calculations in table above.
For commercial, use the residential improvements compared to 2023 without expansion of building
codes as the basis for estimating commercial savings in 2023 and subsequent years.

From John Wilson, August 18, 2008
On quick review, the only figure I question is the 0% trend for nuclear, coal, etc. construction costs. I
believe I have seen some studies (DOE or maybe a Wall Street firm) that estimate trends in construction
costs and they project sharply higher costs in the future for these types of plants.
This is not an endorsement of other figures, I haven’t had the chance to compare the detailed figures for
renewable resource potential . . .

Dear Karen,
On behalf of the Integrated Waste Services Association (IWSA), and, acting as the team leader identified
in the Email below for Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), I am submitting the following data response specific
to the future additional electrical power generation potential of Municipal Solid Waste in Florida.

______________________________________________________________________________
Based on this analysis approximately 1614 MW of additional new electrical generation capacity can
be provided from the MSW that is currently being directed to Class I Landfill operations in the State. This
assessment does not include the existing 517 MW of existing installed generating capacity IWSA reported
to FLPSC on 7/22/08 or the additional 17 MW of new generating capacity scheduled to come on line in
2009 reported to FLPSC by Covanta Energy on 7/22/08 for the Hillsborough Facility Expansion Project.
When taken together, the existing & in construction MSW electrical generating capacity (534 MW) plus
the potential new MSW electrical generating capacity (approximately 1614 MW) represents a total of
approximately 2148 MW of installed electrical generation capacity from MSW that could be fully available
using demonstrated, environmentally sound technology currently in use today in Florida’s 11 WTE
facilities.
In making this assessment of future additional electrical generation potential we followed the direction
provided verbally by FPSC and state here in the assumptions we have made. The key assumptions are
also provided as part of the footnotes included with the Response form. Our assumptions are as follows.

1. We are providing the best case (perfect world) analysis that was suggested, that is, we are
assuming that all MSW generated in the State that is currently being directed to an in-state Class
I Landfill operation for disposal is available for energy recovery.

2. FDEP 2006 data - Table 5A Final Disposition of Municipal Solid Waste in Florida – has been used
as the basis of this analysis and data submittal. Attached.

3. We have adjusted the total quantity of MSW available state wide for energy recovery to reflect the
current beneficial use practice of using the ash residue generated by the State’s 11 WTE facilities
as raw waste landfill “day cover”. See Note #5.
4. A copy of the USEPA letter reference in Notes # 10 & 11 is provided as an attachment.

With respect to the costs associated with electrical energy production from MSW, one public IWSA
member succinctly expressed the problem we have as an industry trying to respond to your questions in
this area - FPSC has asked us to provide a numerical answer to an essay question. WTE facilities are just
one component of a community’s Integrated Solid Waste Management System and hence the facility’s
scope, capital cost, operating & maintenance costs and the community revenue stream requirements,
which include system tipping/disposal fees and the electrical revenues requirements for the renewable
energy being generated, are unique to each community’s system. Since the State’s existing WTE facilities
were initially developed to solve environmental and infrastructure challenges as their first priority and are
now being recognized as an excellent means of recovering renewable energy indigenous to this waste
system while reducing GHG’s, Florida’s WTE facilities truly serve a dual public purpose.
Further, we believe that meeting directly with FPSC staff to discuss a logical approach to RPS related
evaluation factors for new and existing WTE facilities in Florida is a necessary part of this rule making
process. Representatives of IWSA are prepared to meet with FPSC staff at the earliest mutually
acceptance date.
We look forward to FPSC’s response to our suggested course of action.

Appendix B
Cap‐and‐Trade
C&T-1. Greenhouse Gas Cap-and-Trade

Policy Description
A cap‐and‐trade system works by setting an overall limit on emissions and either selling or
distributing, at no cost, emissions “allowances,” or permits, to regulated entities or sources.
These regulated entities must periodically surrender enough allowances to match their reported
emissions or face a penalty. In a system that freely grants allowances, those sources that are able
to reduce their emissions at a lower cost than the allowance price may do so and sell unused
allowances to those who cannot achieve reductions as cost‐effectively. In a system where
allowances are initially sold, cost‐effective emissions reductions reduce the number of
allowances that must be purchased. Either way, cap‐and‐trade creates a financial incentive for
emitters to continually seek out new emission‐reducing technologies and cut their emissions as
much as possible. By creating a market for the allowances, regulated entities have the choice of
either purchasing allowances or directly reducing emissions and, as a result, resources are
directed to the most cost‐effective emissions reduction investments. To achieve overall
emissions reductions over time, programs gradually lower the emissions “cap” by reducing the
total number of available allowances.
Perhaps the best known example of cap‐and‐trade is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) program to cut sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from power plants. Established under the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, this program successfully proved the emissions trading
concept by achieving dramatic, cost‐effective reductions. More recently, the trading approach
has been applied to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the European Union (EU)1 and
proposed by several U.S.‐based initiatives including the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI),2 the Western Climate Initiative (WCI),3 and the Midwestern Regional
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord.4
On July 13, 2007, Governor Charlie Crist signed Executive Order 07‐128,5 which created the
Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (Action Team). The Action Team is

charged with identifying means by which Florida can fully achieve or surpass the statewide
GHG reductions specified in Executive Order 07‐127.6 These recommendations need to be
guided by an evaluation of the possible consequences to Florida’s environment, economy, and
society from global climate change. During 2007, the Action Team issued its Phase 1 Report. The
report offers broad policy guidance in key areas for consideration by the Governor and
Legislature or further consideration by the Action Team, including a market‐based regulatory
approach for utility emissions.
On June 25, 2008, Governor Crist signed House Bill 7135 (HB 7135), a comprehensive energy
and economic development package aimed at reducing GHG emissions as well as encouraging
investment in alternative and renewable energy technologies. Section 65 of HB 7135 calls for the
Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to propose rules for the creation of a
cap‐and‐trade regulatory program to reduce GHG emissions from major emitters. This policy is
the result of the Phase 2 investigation called for in the Phase 1 report and offers pre‐rulemaking
guidance to the DEP in response to the requirements of HB 7135.
There is growing expectation that Congress will require a federal cap‐and‐trade program,
perhaps during the next Administration. By initiating, joining, or developing a state and/or
regional cap‐and‐trade system in the meantime, Florida would be taking an important step
toward potentially influencing the outcome of the federal policy debate in its favor.

Policy Design
Ultimately the pollution‐cutting performance of a cap‐and‐trade program depends largely on
how it is structured. Key design parameters are discussed separately below.
The cap‐and‐trade policy is designed and analyzed to work in concert with non‐cap‐and‐trade
policies and measures. The integration of other policies serves to reduce compliance costs and
ease attainment of goals and caps. Emissions reductions, costs, and cost savings from many of
these other measures help Florida comply with the cap; they also serve as a basis for the cap‐
and‐trade modeling. As a result, the expected operation of the cap‐and‐trade program is
integrated with other policies and policy recommendations, and is not presented as a stand‐
alone program.

Reduction Targets and Time Frames
Table B‐1‐1 shows the schedule for GHG emission reductions is pursuant to Executive Order
07‐127.

Sector Coverage
The regulation of GHG emissions should be economy‐wide and should commence as soon as
possible; however, a cap‐and‐trade program may apply only to a limited number of sectors.
Sector inclusion in the cap‐and‐trade program should be guided by cost‐effectiveness,
administrative efficiency, overall reduction potential, experience by other jurisdictions, and
whether alternative policies are preferred. The Florida cap‐and‐trade program should include
the electric sector at the beginning. Rulemaking consideration should be also given to (1)
industrial stationary source emissions; (2) residential and commercial fuel use; (3)
transportation fuels; and (4) energy extraction, processing, and transportation. These sectors
may be better candidates for inclusion in a subsequent phase. The transportation and residential
and commercial fuel use sectors could also be considered through rulemaking. They have not
been included in prior cap‐and‐trade programs, although WCI has proposed to include them in
its program beginning in 2015. Unlike the electricity, energy extraction, and industrial sectors,
these two sectors would most likely have to be regulated upstream of the actual point of
emissions. The regulated entity in the transportation, residential, and commercial fuel use
sectors may need to be the fuel distributor or importer. Transportation and residential and
commercial fuel use should be studied further and considered for inclusion in a subsequent
phase or they may be better suited for regulation through non‐cap‐and‐trade market
mechanisms. While these and other sectors may not be included in the cap‐and‐trade program
or otherwise regulated at the program start, they should be included or otherwise regulated as
soon as possible.
Other sectors may need alternative methods of regulation based on the factors listed above.
Land development, forestry, agriculture, and waste management are generally not regulated
under a cap‐and‐trade program due to a lack of historical emissions data, difficulty measuring
or verifying current emissions, and for other reasons. Emissions reduction projects or programs
within these sectors may, however, be well‐suited to participate in an “offsets” program as
described below.
There should be a de minimis exemption below which sources within the regulated sectors
would be exempt from regulation. The threshold of the exemption could vary by sector.

Regional Programs
First and foremost, a strong national cap‐and‐trade program is the preferred method for
achieving substantial reductions in GHGs, and Florida should advocate for a national program.
B‐3

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
As the federal government deliberates on a national program, Florida should join a regional
program to advance its GHG reduction goals. Toward that end, Florida should further examine
the economics of joining a regional program, but should not join a regional program where
analysis indicates that Florida would be disadvantaged.
Initial analysis indicates that Florida would benefit from joining the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative (RGGI). RGGI currently comprises 10 northeastern and Mid‐Atlantic states and will
regulate emissions from fossil fuel–powered electric generation units (EGUs) with a nameplate
capacity of 25 megawatts (MW) or greater. Two 100 percent auction‐based cap‐and‐trade
scenarios for year 2020 are simulated for Florida joining the RGGI program.7 The two scenarios
correspond to hypothetical allowance prices of $7/tCO2e and $1/tCO2e, respectively. Preliminary
modeling indicates that Florida sources would represent slightly less than half of the total
electric generation emissions from the eleven states, and, depending on assumptions used,
would mitigate between 70 and 76 MMtCO2e (million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent)
in 2020, with the balance of 75 to 80 MMtCO2e accounted for by allowance purchases. Florida
RGGI sources would expect to see a cost savings of between $1.5 to about $2.0 billion dollars in
2020 by participating in the cap‐and‐trade program. Please note any additional savings that
might be realized from the recycling of the auction revenues by the government are not
included. Complete modeling results and analysis may be found in Annex 1 at the end of this
Appendix.
Florida should seek “observer” status with RGGI as soon as possible to examine the program in
greater detail, closely monitor progress and prepare for membership if it is desired.
Initial analysis indicates that Florida may benefit from joining the cap‐and‐trade portion of the
Western Climate Initiative (WCI). Further study would be necessary to determine whether
participation in the other planned WCI programs (for example, regional low‐carbon fuel
standard and renewable portfolio standard) would benefit Florida. WCI is currently comprised
of seven U.S. states and four Canadian provinces; its proposed cap‐and‐trade program will
cover emissions from multiple sectors representing approximately 90 percent of total regional
emissions. WCI just released its design recommendations on September 23, 2008. Analysis is
based on the WCI proposed program design. The cap‐and‐trade simulation for Florida joining
WCI covers a much broader range of emission sources than the RGGI simulation (basically all
the sectors except the agriculture, forestry, and waste management sectors). The analysis results
indicate that Florida would be a permit seller in the market. Florida WCI sources would expect
to see a cost savings of $191 million in 2020 by participating in the cap‐and‐trade program as
opposed to achieving the same reductions without it. Florida sources would be expected to
mitigate 18.46 MMtCO2e more than required to meet targets due to the relatively low cost of
mitigation and the opportunity to sell allowances to other WCI Partner sources. Complete
7

A 100 percent auction is assumed due to limitations in the model resulting from RGGI’s low cost mitigation
opportunities (see Annex 1 to Appendix B). As a policy matter, the Action Team is neither recommending nor
assuming that Florida will use 100 percent auctions as a means of initially distributing allowances.

modeling results and analysis may be found in Annex 2 at the end of this Appendix. Because
WCI is scheduled to begin on January 1, 2012, at the earliest, there is ample opportunity to
conduct further economic analysis and observe the early operation of WCI.
Florida should seek “observer” status with WCI as soon as possible to examine the program in
greater detail, closely monitor progress, and prepare for membership if it is desired.
These two regional programs may not be mutually exclusive. Florida should explore the
economics and potential obstacles, complications, and benefits associated with joining both.
Six Midwestern states and Manitoba are currently engaged in discussions toward the
development of a third regional cap‐and‐trade program. Recently organized, the group expects
to release a draft program design this November. Given the newness of the Midwestern effort,
the Action Team has been unable to evaluate whether Florida might benefit from participation
or membership. Florida should continue to monitor the progress of this program and
investigate the advisability of affiliation or membership as the Midwestern program develops.
At the same time, Florida should reach out to the other Southern states in the hope of
collaborating with its neighbors to (1) jointly influence the development of a national cap‐and‐
trade program, (2) explore the potential for multiple Southern states joining one or more
regional programs, (3) help address “leakage” issues, and (4) explore the creation of a Southern
regional climate initiative to reduce GHG emissions, stimulate the development of renewable
energy sources, reduce dependence on imported fuels, and stimulate the creation of industries
specializing in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and carbon mitigation technologies.
Finally, it is strongly recommended that Florida should not pursue a one‐state cap‐and‐trade
program.

Caps and Goals
Florida’s GHG reduction cap‐and‐trade program should be designed to achieve the emission
reduction goals set forth in Executive Order 07‐127. However, as directed in that Executive
Order and the recently enacted HB 7135, Florida should evaluate the conditions under which
the state could cost‐effectively link its trading system to the systems of other states, or regions,
such as the RGGI.
If Florida joins a regional climate initiative, it should accept the regional goal as long as it is
consistent with the state’s GHG reduction goals. Current modeling indicates that RGGI should
bring Florida’s electric sector emissions to the state goal; however, if it does not, additional
policies and measures would be required to reduce GHG emissions to meet the state goal.

Flexibility and Cost Containment Mechanisms
The mechanisms described below contain a brief description followed by the policy
recommendation.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Offsets—Regulated sources can comply with the cap‐and‐trade program in three ways; they
can reduce emissions directly, they can acquire and surrender allowances sufficient to cover
their emissions, or they can invest in qualifying offset projects and surrender offset credits.
Offset projects are undertaken voluntarily and generate revenue for the project owner
through the sale of offset credits, which are equivalent to government‐issued allowances.
Emission reductions from regulated sources are therefore not eligible as offset projects;
otherwise these reductions would be double‐counted, once for the benefit of the regulated
source under the cap, and again for the benefit of the offset purchaser. To ensure the
integrity of the emissions cap, offset projects reduce emissions or sequester carbon from
uncapped, out‐of‐sector projects that are recognized by the program as qualifying for
allowance credit. In most cases, any emissions included under any cap‐and‐trade programs’
cap cannot be reduced and also qualify as an offset credit under any other cap‐and‐trade
program. Offsets provide an incentive for low‐cost investments in uncapped emission
reductions as an alternative to higher‐cost, in‐sector reductions or allowance purchases.
Recommendation: The cap‐and‐trade program should allow offsets without limits; however, the offset
program must ensure rigorous quality standards.

•

Safety Valve—A safety valve is a program feature designed to limit or moderate the cost of
allowances for the purpose of ensuring that the program will not have an unacceptable
impact on consumer costs. Safety valves can be as direct and conceptually simple as an
allowance price cap or as complex and indirect as the RGGI’s stepped expansion of offset
opportunities triggered by allowance prices8. The safety valve can be used in conjunction
with other tools to mitigate price volatility (such as banking and borrowing). It should be
noted that hitting the safety valve price cap would effectively convert the cap‐and‐trade
program into a carbon tax at that price.
Recommendation: The cap‐and‐trade program needs appropriate allowance price containment
mechanisms, especially in the early years. Further study is needed before the specific mechanisms can
be recommended.

•

Banking—Banking allows permit holders to withhold unneeded allowances from the
market, or from surrender‐for‐emissions compliance, without expiration. A banked
allowance may be used in any compliance period beyond the issuance period without
penalty. Banking is seen as a means of mitigating market volatility by allowing holders to
hold onto allowances (thereby mitigating supply) when prices are low, and to use or sell
them (thereby mitigating demand) when prices are high.
Recommendation: The cap‐and‐trade program should allow unlimited banking.

•

Borrowing—Borrowing of allowances permits emitters to release excess tons of GHGs in the
current compliance period in return for greater reductions in a future compliance period.

8 The Western Climate Initiative employs banking, offsets and three‐year compliance periods to mitigate allowance
prices but does not have a safety valve.

B‐6
Appendix B

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Recommendation: Borrowing is an important cost containment mechanism and should be allowed,
but agreement was not reached on what conditions (for example, Warner‐Lieberman–type limits by
emitter, time limits, or interest) should be imposed.

Allowance Distribution
One of the most difficult issues confronting cap‐and‐trade program designers is how the
allowances are initially introduced to the market. The two principal methods are free allocation
and auction sale. Free allocation is the method used in the EPA SO2 trading program and was
widely used in the first two phases of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) program. RGGI
will auction nearly 100 percent of their allowances and the EU is gradually moving in the
direction of greater reliance on auctions. WCI is still deliberating on the issue, although it is
likely that a decision on how best to distribute allowances will ultimately rest with participating
jurisdictions.
Under a free allocation system, jurisdictions distribute allowances free of charge to regulated
entities according to a formula based upon historical emissions, benchmarked emissions (the
expected emissions per unit output for a facility with a preferred technological configuration),
or on some other basis. Free allocation systems may include equity features such as a “reserve”
for new market entrants to avoid creating a competitive disadvantage. The formula that
determines the number of allowances allocated to each source can be challenging to create.
Historical emissions are a common approach, but issues such as selecting the time period to use
as a basis and various equity adjustments can be difficult to determine. Benchmarking is
straightforward in principle but very difficult to achieve in practice.
Under an auction system, allowances are presented to the market by sale at auction. Regulated
entities are therefore required to purchase allowances. Revenues are collected by the issuing
jurisdiction. Auctioning allowances resolves the “allocation basis” and many equity issues
arising from the free allocation method but presents a new set of challenges, including the
additional cost imposed on regulated entities and consumers. Emitters in some sectors are able
to pass these costs onto their customers, but others are not. The cost passed along to the
consumer may be a public policy concern and, in cases where competitive pressure prevents
this, the economic impact on the emitter might be a concern. However, these concerns can be
addressed by designing the program to be revenue neutral and returning the allowance value
from the auction to consumers directly, or through programs implemented for their benefit. In
addition, there is the question of what the issuing jurisdiction will do with the auction revenues.
There is also a concern for windfall profits resulting from free allocation, as happened in some
instances in the EU. This can be an issue when the emitter is not price regulated but is free to
pass the cost along to customers, as is the case among generators in most of the RGGI states. In
states where generators are price regulated, such as Florida, the value of the freely allocated
allowance can be directed to the benefit of the ratepayer through rate setting.

B‐7
Appendix B

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Free allocation and auctioning are not mutually exclusive. Programs can distribute some
percentage of allowances using one method and the balance with the other. Programs may
change the ratio of free allocation/auction distribution over time. Programs may distribute
allowances to different regulated sectors using different methods or a different mix of methods.
Programs may even distribute allowances differently among different classes of sources within
a sector (for example, municipal utilities, co‐ops, and investor‐ owned utilities).
The Action Team was unable to reach a consensus recommendation on the central issue of
initial Allowance Distribution method. By a 13‐5 super majority, the Action Team recommends
that strong consideration be given to auctioning a substantial amount of allowances. The Action
Team recognizes that as RGGI and WCI evolve additional information will become available to
DEP and the Legislature to better evaluate the use of auctions at the beginning of the cap‐and‐
trade program and over time.
Those opposed to this recommendation expressed concern that there has been no Florida‐
specific analysis of the relative cost to the consumer for allowance distribution by auction or
free‐of‐charge allocation. Without such information, they argue, any recommendation stating a
preference would be premature. Other concerns include whether requiring some industries to
pay for allowances would put them at a competitive disadvantage. Others were concerned that
there was no assurance that revenues from the sale of allowances would be used by the state for
related purposes such as those stated below.
Those who supported auctioning pointed out that presentations from representatives of RGGI
and the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) had recommended the use of
auctioning. Others stated that the revenues generated by the auctions would be needed to
finance other key policies and measures proposed by the Action Team. At least one member
observed that given the differences among electric utilities there would be no fair way to
allocate allowances between them. It was observed that the formula would likely be the subject
of heavy lobbying in the Legislature, and that if allowances were distributed on the basis of
historical emissions, customers of utilities with historically higher electric rates and cleaner
generation would be disadvantaged, and those with lower rates and higher emissions would be
advantaged. Supporters of the position expressed the belief that auctioning is the most fair
distribution method.
By unanimous consent the Action Team offers the following general recommendations which
could guide future policy makers in answering the question of allowance distribution.
Any allowance distribution system would need to be periodically evaluated to determine
whether it is working properly and serving the program goals.
The cap‐and‐trade program should strive to be revenue‐neutral to consumers as much as
possible. There are five broad purposes to which allowance value (either the allowances
themselves or proceeds from their sale) should be applied. These are not in any priority order:

B‐8
Appendix B

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Promote energy efficiency investments,

•

Mitigate impacts on ratepayers and consumers with particular attention to low‐income
consumers,

•

Accelerate the development and use of emissions mitigation technologies, including
renewable or zero‐carbon technologies,

•

Mitigate impacts of climate change (for example, fund adaptation strategies), and

•

Protect regulated emitters from competitive disadvantage.

There are a number of other important uses of allowance value which should also be
considered, such as stimulating or rewarding investment in carbon emissions abatement
technologies, funding program administration, and protecting regulated emitters from
economic disadvantage. One member felt strongly that all allowance value should be used to
mitigate the program’s impact on ratepayers and consumers.
It is the Action Team’s strong recommendation that if any revenues are generated from the sale of
allowances they should never be used to supplement general revenues to the State of Florida.

Reporting
The cap‐and‐trade reporting system should be consistent with any national requirement. Every
effort should be made to ensure that regulated entities are required to complete only one report
for both state and national efforts. The reporting system should be as broad as possible; a de
minimis limit may be needed, given administrative and cost concerns.
Mandatory reporting of GHG emissions is now legislatively required at both the state and
federal levels. Adoption of reporting rules and collection of emissions data should proceed as
quickly as possible in advance of the cap‐and‐trade program to verify the data from sources and
sectors where the historical lack of such requirements injects a significant level of uncertainty
into historical emissions estimates and future projections.

Leakage
Leakage occurs when, in response to program incentives, utilities choose to either increase out‐
of‐region fossil‐based power purchases or investors choose to construct new generation units in
unregulated border jurisdictions. In either case, both the environmental benefits and in‐state
investment are lost. It is noted that in a national program, leakage is not an issue. Leakage can
be addressed through careful design of the point‐of‐regulation, as in the First Jurisdiction

______________________________________________________________________________
Deliverer (FJD) plan in WCI. FJD requires compliance from any generator within the region
plus any entity that imports fossil‐based power from outside the WCI region.9
Historically, between 1990 and 2005, electricity imports have contributed between 9 percent and
16 percent of total electricity consumption in Florida. Accordingly, it is critical that the cap‐and‐
trade program baseline include these out‐of‐state sources and their changes over time to
accurately define the reduction requirements under the current generation mix.
The Action Team believes leakage is a potentially serious concern. Based on the initial analysis,
projected 2020 business‐as‐usual GHG emissions from electricity imports represent
approximately 10 percent of total electricity emissions, or 19.2 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e). This amount is equal to about one‐third of the total electric
utility sector emissions reductions required by 2020 to meet the Governor’s GHG reduction
goals. Further, electricity imports and their associated GHG emissions would be expected to
increase if Florida’s electricity generation sector was subject to a carbon cap and generation in
adjacent states was not subject to a similar requirement.
The Action Team recommends that leakage must be addressed by any cap‐and‐trade program
or by Florida through other means if a regional cap‐and‐trade program does not do so.

Trial Period
The first recommendations under regional programs are that there should be a strong federal
cap‐and‐trade program and that Florida should be an advocate for national action. It is
recommended that a new national program should incorporate a trial period to facilitate the
transition, verify data, and sort out administrative and other details. The trial period should
afford greater flexibility to the regulated community than would be otherwise allowed, but it
should nonetheless impose enforceable, binding compliance obligations on regulated sources.
The second recommendation under regional programs is that Florida should join the RGGI, the
WCI, or both. The issue of a trial period in these cases is a matter of regional agreement. Florida
should support the trial period requirements (or lack of them) of any regional program it might
seek to join.

Federal Program
As stated under regional programs, a strong national cap‐and‐trade program is preferred over a
regional approach. However, for the purpose of initiating GHG emissions reductions sooner
than would be possible by waiting for federal action, the recommendation is to join one or more
regional programs. By having Florida join a regional program now, the state can influence the
design and development of regional rules that will likely influence a national program design.
9 The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative does not address the issue of Leakage within the program design. RGGI
recognizes the issue and will monitor inter‐regional contracts and purchases to assess whether Leakage is occurring.
RGGI has indicated that if leakage proves to be a serious issue, action will be taken to address it.

______________________________________________________________________________
Joining a regional program will prepare Florida’s regulated sources for the requirements and
opportunities presented by a national program.
As noted under Reporting, the early success of any program depends in large part on the
quality and reliability of emissions data. Florida and federal reporting requirements should be
harmonized to minimize the burden on reporting entities.
Assuming a federal program is enacted subsequent to Florida’s participation in one or more
regional programs, it is not the intention that the two programs—regional and federal—would
impose separate and overlapping requirements on regulated sources. Instead, there should be a
planned transition from the regional to the national program allowing for the integration of the
regional program into the national one, including data transfer, full recognition of allowance
value and offsets, and recognition of emissions reductions and compliance schemes.

Implementation Mechanisms
As stated above, these recommendations should be reviewed by the DEP and used as a basis for
drafting proposed rules in response to the requirements of the HB 7135. Through the
rulemaking process, additional program modeling and economic analysis should be performed
to more precisely ascertain costs to regulated entities and consumers, as well as economic
benefits from reduced consumption of fossil fuel and other co‐benefits. Pursuant to HB 7135,
rulemaking should be completed by the end of 2009, and proposed rules should be presented to
the Legislature for ratification in 2010.
The recommendation that Florida become an observer to both the RGGI and WCI regional cap‐
and‐trade programs will provide the state with direct access to the ongoing development and
implementation of these programs. This will not only provide better information for assessing
whether Florida should join one or both programs, it will also afford Florida the benefit of
access to their knowledge and experience as the state begins to develop its own rules.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
All GHG mitigation policies and measures within capped sectors have the potential to affect
cap‐and‐trade program costs and benefits. Related programs include RGGI, WCI, and the
Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord created by the Midwestern Governors
Association (MGA).

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
This may depend upon the sectors included and the program design. At a minimum, carbon
dioxide (CO2) will be reduced. However, a multi‐sector program, especially one including
industrial emissions, could reduce emissions of all six major GHGs.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings

The simulation results given below are intended to provide basic insight to the economic
implications of a cap‐and‐trade system. They are based on the best available data at the time of
the writing of this report. The accuracy of the simulations will be enhanced as more primary
data become available. Specifically, the most valuable data additions would provide
information on GHG reduction capability and cost for mitigation/sequestration options in RGGI
states, and in WCI states for which primary data are not available at this time.

In the auction‐based cap‐and‐trade analysis for Year 2020, at a hypothetical allowance price of
$7/tCO2e, Florida would choose to reduce around 50 percent of its total emissions from the
power sector (or 75.99 MMtCO2e) by the in‐state mitigation options (either through supply‐side

______________________________________________________________________________
or demand‐side options). Florida would purchase the allowances for the remaining emissions
from the auctioneer at the price of $7/tCO2e. The total net cost for Florida is ‐$1.52 billion, which
is the sum of ‐$2.04 billion mitigation cost and $0.52 billion auction cost. The cost‐effectiveness
with respect to the emission reductions of Florida (dividing the total net cost by the total
emission reductions by the state) is ‐$19.95/tCO2e. In the $1 allowance price scenario, Florida
would reduce 46.7 percent emissions (or 70.62 MMtCO2e) by the in‐state mitigation options, and
buy the allowances from the auctioneer for any additional emissions. The total net cost for
Florida in this scenario is ‐$1.98 billion, which is the sum of ‐$2.06 billion mitigation cost and
$0.08 billion auction cost. The corresponding cost‐effectiveness is ‐$28.09/tCO2e.
In the cap‐and‐trade analysis of Florida joining the 10 WCI partners in 2020,10 Florida is the
biggest permit seller in the market because the state has many cost‐saving mitigation options
(e.g., improvements in energy efficiency, RPS, etc.), thus has a relatively flatter cost curve than
the WCI average level. The permit price in the market is $65.55/tCO2e. Florida would mitigate
38 percent of the total emissions (or 147.60 MMtCO2e) from the capped sectors and sell 18.46
MMtCO2e permits to WCI. Washington and California are the biggest permit buyers. Please
note the equilibrium permit price is the price of the last permit sold, which is also equal to the
price of the last ton of CO2e mitigated (its marginal mitigation cost). It is the same for each
state/province for a given case. The average mitigation cost per unit of CO2 equivalent (or the
cost‐effectiveness) in the simulation differs for each state/province. For Florida, it is ‐
$5.70/tCO2e. Compared with the pre‐trading condition, Florida can save $191 million in 2020 by
joining WCI, a cost saving of around 10.26 percent.

Data Sources
Marginal cost curves for states and provinces are developed directly (1) on the basis of
assessment of state‐level actions developed through state planning processes in Connecticut,
Maryland, Maine, New York, Vermont, Rhode Island, Arizona, California, Montana, New
Mexico, Washington, and Florida (developed on the basis of mitigation costs of individual
policy options presented in Center for Climate Strategies [CCS] reports or other assessments of
the respective state climate change action plans); or (2) by approximation methods for other
states/provinces based on cost curves of one of their adjacent states with actual data.
Emission projections data for WCI states/provinces come from the Task 0 database established
and maintained by CCS (based on the inventory and forecast studies of respective states and
provinces). The emission projections data for RGGI states come from the “Reference Case”
document on the RGGI website.

Quantification Methods
The modeling of various cap‐and‐trade scenarios used a nonlinear programming model of
emission allowance trading. This model is based on the well‐established principles of the ability
10 Because of the limitation of time and resources, we have not included Ontario, the newly partner of WCI in the
simulations at the time we write this report.

______________________________________________________________________________
of unrestricted permit trading to achieve a cost‐effective allocation of resources in the presence
of externalities.11 The model requires equalization of the marginal cost of all trading participants
with the equilibrium permit price. This ensures minimization of total net compliance costs for
each state and minimization of total abatement costs for the cap‐and‐trade program as a
whole.12
In the auction case, there would be no trading among states. According to the basic rationale
for permit trading, in equilibrium, each state would choose to mitigate emissions as long as its
marginal abatement cost is lower than or equal to the price of allowances, and purchase any
remaining allowance (the difference between the state’s BAU level and the amount mitigated by
autarkic actions) from the auctioneer.
Please see Annex 2 for the detailed summary of the modeling of the cap‐and‐trade program and
the key assumptions adopted in the analysis.

Key Uncertainties
A number of design variables (including the reduction targets, sectoral coverage, allocation
methods, flexibility mechanisms, and level of complementary measures) can affect the
simulation results, such as permit prices, in‐state mitigation volume, trading volume, and cost
savings from joining the cap‐and‐trade program.

Additional Benefits and Costs
As noted above, the cap‐and‐trade analysis considers the price paid by those purchasing
allowances at auction as a cost in the program. The analysis does not consider any benefits or
value derived from the use of those revenues by the state for the purposes recommended in the
Allowance Distribution section or any other use.

Feasibility Issues
As noted in the discussion.

Annex 1. Cap‐and‐Trade Simulation Results
Analysis of cap‐and‐trade among Power Sectors of RGGI States and Florida in 2020
This study is based on the use of a Non‐linear Programming (NLP) Model capable of analyzing
various environmental policy instruments, including cap‐and‐trade, carbon taxes, and
regulations, under a variety of conditions. For cap‐and‐trade, for example, potential policy
refinements include: free granting vs. auctioning, upper limits on permit prices, offsets,
banking, etc.
We first simulated a cap‐and‐trade system for RGGI states plus Florida with free granting of
allowances. Because of the extensive availability of low‐cost mitigation options, the supply of
allowances would exceed the demand at all positive allowance prices. Supply and demand
would only be equal at a negative price, which would never prevail in a real world situation;
hence allowance trading would not take place.
In usual cap‐and‐trade cases, where the equilibrium point corresponds to a positive allowance
price, auction and free granting would reach the same cost‐effectiveness level, for example, the
auction price would be at the same level as the equilibrium price in the allowance trading
market, and the individual and total CO2 reductions achieved by the partner states in these two
allocation cases would be the same, with the overall emission reduction target of the region
being met. The only difference between these two allocation cases would be that the auction can
generate revenues to the state government, which in turn can be recycled to fund research and
development in clean energy technologies, end‐use energy efficiencies, etc., and thus lower the
impacts to the electricity ratepayers.
Similar to the free granting case, in a 100 percent auction‐based cap‐and‐trade program, the
total mitigation undertaken by the 10 RGGI states plus Florida would exceed the overall cap at
all positive allowance prices.
Therefore, in this report we analyze two scenarios with hypothetical positive allowance price
levels and evaluate the mitigation and allowance purchase choices of the states in a 100 percent
auction‐based cap‐and‐trade. This is consistent with the current operation of RGGI, which calls
for most permits to be auctioned.
According to the initial RGGI allowance allocation, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, and Rhode Island do not have any GHG mitigation obligations, since the allocated
allowances to these states (see Column 3 of Table 1) exceed their 2020 BAU emission levels (see
Column 2 of Table 1). For the remaining five RGGI states and Florida, which have binding

mitigation goals, the reduction target (percent) is computed in Column 4 of Table B‐1‐1. Please
note that the 2020 cap for Florida is computed by interpolating the state’s 2017 goal (to return to
2000 levels) and 2025 goal (to return to 1990 levels).

* The shaded states, MD, ME, NH, VT, and RI, have allocated allowances higher than their projected 2020 BAU
emission levels according to the RGGI States allowances allocation table.
Sources: 1. RGGI States GHG Caps by Year from 2009 to 2018 are provided by Jeff Wennberg from CCS. Numbers
for year 2019 and year 2020 are estimated by extrapolating 2014 to 2018 numbers.
2. RGGI states 2020 BAU emission projections are obtained from RGGI website http://www.rggi.org/documents.htm,
the Reference Case projections. The 2020 values are computed by interpolating 2018 and 2021 projections.
3. The 2020 cap of Florida is computed by interpolating the state’s 2017 goal (to return to 2000 levels) and 2025 goal
(to return to 1990 levels). The 2020 BAU emission from the power sector (production‐based) is from the draft Florida
Inventory and Forecast report by CCS. http://www.flclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm.

In the auction case, we assume the 2020 emission caps for Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey,
New York, Massachusetts, and Florida are the same as shown in Table B‐1‐1. For Maryland,
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island which have excess allowances in the free
granting case, we assume their caps in the auction case would equal the state BAU 2020
emission levels (for example, there is no reason to purchase any excess allowances at auction).

In the auction case, there would be no trading among states. According to the basic rationale
for permit trading, in equilibrium, each state would choose to mitigate emissions as long as its
marginal abatement cost is lower than or equal to the price of allowances, and purchase any
remaining allowance (the difference between the state’s BAU level and the amount mitigated by
autarkic actions) from the auctioneer.

Next, we analyze a 100 percent auction‐based cap‐and‐trade case with a hypothetical allowance
price at $7/tCO2e. Table B‐1‐3 (Column 4) presents the amount of emissions that can be reduced
by each state’s autarkic (own) mitigation actions associated with a marginal cost of $7/tCO2e
(these are computed based on the states’ marginal abatement cost curves shown in Figure 1).
The simulation results of the auction case with an allowance price equal to $7/tCO2e are
presented in Table B‐1‐4. A second simulation with the auction price assumed to be at $1/tCO2e
is presented in Table B‐1‐5.
In the auction case, each state would utilize all its mitigation potential with marginal cost less
than $7/tCO2e before purchasing allowances from the auctioneer, because it would be cheaper
for them to reduce emissions than to buy allowances from the auctioneer at seven dollars. As a
result, the total emission reductions achieved by the 11 states in this case are 117.81 MMtCO2.
As indicated before, the sum of the mitigations undertaken by the states would exceed the
mitigation needed to achieve the cap of the 11 states as a whole at all positive allowance prices.
B‐18
Appendix B

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
The total cap of the 11 states is 262.70 MMtCO2e in 2020, or 18.05 percent below the BAU
emissions of 320.55 MMtCO2e. The total emission reductions in the $7/tCO2e case are 36.75
percent below BAU, 18.71 percent more than the cap requires. Comparing the numbers in the
second column and the fourth column of Table B‐1‐3, we can see that Connecticut and New
Jersey will reduce fewer emissions than the state emissions budget requires. The other nine
states would mitigate more than their budgets require. Cumulatively, the 11 states would
mitigate emissions 59.96 MMtCO2e more than the total cap indicates. The basic rationale is that
it is cheaper to mitigate than to buy an auctioned permit for a broad range of emission levels.
As shown in Table B‐1‐4, because of the availability of large cost saving mitigation potentials,
mitigation cost for all the 11 states are negative. The auction cost is computed by multiplying
the amount of allowances the state buys from the auctioneer by the allowance price. The total
net cost of a state is the sum of its mitigation cost and the auction cost. Most states have
negative total net cost, which indicates overall cost savings from joining the auction‐based cap‐
and‐trade program. The total cost savings for Florida in the $7/tCO2e auction price case are $1.5
billion.
Comparing the two auction cases with auction prices at seven dollars and one dollar, the
amount the states choose to reduce by mitigation options (117.81 MMtCO2 vs. 110.60 MMtCO2,
respectively) and the amount to be bought from the auctioneer (202.74 MMtCO2 vs. 209.95
MMtCO2, respectively) differ slightly. However, the results show that when the allowance price
is lower, the states would choose to reduce fewer emissions on their own and purchase more
allowances from the auctioneer. The biggest difference between these two cases is the total
auction cost. This is due primarily to the difference of the two auction price levels. In addition,
Delaware shifts to the list of states that mitigate less than their budget requires. Cumulatively,
the 11 states would mitigate emissions 16.46 percent or 52.75 MMtCO2e more than the total cap
indicates.
The recycling or use of the auction revenues by the government is not evaluated in this study;
therefore the price paid for allowances purchased at auction is treated simply as a cost.

Figure B-1-1. State Marginal Cost Curves of Power Sector, 2020
Notes: 1. Marginal cost curves of CT, MD, ME, NY, VT, RI, and FL are developed based on mitigation options data of
these states (from state final or drafted climate action plans).
2. The marginal cost curves of the states are developed based on the reduction potential and mitigation cost/saving
data of individual options that contribute to the emission reductions from power sector. These options not only
include those designed directly for the electricity supply sector (such as promotion of renewable energy utilization,
repowering existing plants, generation performance standards, etc.), but also include options in RCI sectors that
contribute to the reduction of electricity consumption (for example demand‐side management, energy efficiency
appliances, building codes, etc.). The emission reduction potentials of these options are adjusted by multiplying the
percentage of electricity consumption to total energy consumption in the RCI sector. RCI options that relate entirely
to reduction of other fossil fuels consumption (such as gas, oil) are not included in the cost curves above.
3. There are no direct data for MA, NJ, NH, and DE. Marginal cost curves for these four states are developed based
on cost curves of four reference states RI, NY, CT, and MD, respectively. For each of the four states that lack the
direct data, mitigation cost/saving data for the reference state is adopted. Emission reduction potential data of the
reference state is adjusted by the weights of emissions from the ES and R, C, I sectors of the state under estimation.

In the above analysis, we have assumed the Florida 2020 cap is equal to its state goal
(interpolation of the state 2017 and 2025 goals). Next, we would look at the scenario in which
Florida has the same 2020 cap as the RGGI states as whole, which is 10 percent below current
(2008) levels. Table B‐1‐6 is very similar to Table B‐1‐2, except for the Florida and Total rows.
The RGGI goal of 10 percent below 2008 levels translates to 119.44 MMtCO2e emissions budget
to Florida (compared with the 109.97 MMtCO2e budget in the Florida state goal scenario).

With the same hypothetical allowance price levels ($7/tCO2e and $1/tCO2e) as in the previous
scenario (Florida state goal scenario), the amount of emissions the state chooses to mitigate and
the amount of allowances it purchases from the auctioneer are the same as before. Therefore,
the simulation results of the scenario in which Florida follows the RGGI goal are same as the
results shown in Tables B‐1‐4 and 5 (except for the third column in Tables B‐1‐4 and 5 which
shows the 2020 emissions cap/budget). The percentages of emissions Florida chooses to
mitigate are 50.23 percent (or 75.99 MMtCO2e) in the $7 case and 46.68 percent (or 70.62
MMtCO2e) in the $1 case, respectively. These are same in the two scenarios. However, since
Florida has less stringent mitigation target in the RGGI goal scenario than in the state goal
scenario (21.05 percent vs. 27.31 percent, or 31.85 MMtCO2e vs. 41.32 MMtCO2e below 2020
BAU), the only difference in these two scenarios is that Florida would reduce even more
emissions than required by its emissions budget in the RGGI goal scenario.

Development of the Power Sector Marginal Cost Curve for Florida
The Florida power sector marginal cost curve is developed based on the reduction potential and
mitigation cost/saving data of individual options that contribute to the emission reductions
from power sector. These options not only include those designed directly for the electricity
supply sector (such as promotion of renewable energy utilization, power plant efficiency
improvements, etc.), but also include options in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors
that contribute to the reduction of electricity consumption (for example, demand‐side
management, energy efficiency appliances, building codes, etc.). Therefore, we collected the
2020 GHG reduction potential and mitigation cost/saving data of individual options that are
quantitatively analyzed by the ESD (Energy Supply and Demand) Technical Working Group.
Table B‐1‐7 presents the list of these options. Please note these are only preliminary analysis
results; they are subject to change with the undergoing concurrent stakeholder process.

The Florida production‐based emissions from power sector in 2020 are 151.3 MMtCO2e.
This is a recent action additional to the recommended policy options. We include this option in the list to develop
the cost curve since it is not included in the baseline emission forecast.
3 The total GHG emission reduction potentials of this option are 5.5 MMtCO2e in 2020. However, only about 4.21
percent or 0.18 MMtCO2e are the avoided emissions from electricity generation. The remaining reductions come
from the avoided emissions from landfill methane capture.

option, with reduction potentials translated into percentages of the 2020 BAU emissions level in

presented in Column 4. The options are ordered in ascending sequence in terms of cost,
beginning with the cheapest option. Column 6 calculates the cumulative GHG reduction
potentials of the first n policy options listed in the table. The last column presents the
proportion of GHG mitigation contributed by each option.
Based on the data presented in Table B‐1‐7, the stepwise marginal cost function of Florida
power sector in 2020 is first drawn in Figure B‐1‐2. The horizontal axis represents the
percentage of GHG emissions reduction, and the vertical axis represents the marginal cost or
savings of mitigation. In the figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual
mitigation option. The width of the segment indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of
the option in percentage terms. The height of the segment relative to the X‐axis shows the
average cost (saving) of reducing one ton of GHG with the application of the option.
Next, we fit a smooth curve through the data using statistical analysis (also see Figure B‐1‐2).
We weight each policy option based on its GHG mitigation potential to give relatively greater
influence to those options that have the potential for higher levels of application. This fitted
curve is then used in our cap‐and‐trade analysis model.
The fitted curve shown in Figure A1 has the following functional form:

MC = a + b × ln(1 − R)
Where, MC is the marginal cost; R is the percentage reduction of GHG emissions; a and b are
parameters.

Figure B-1-2. Stepwise and Fitted Marginal Cost Curve of Florida Power Sector, 2020
The logarithmic functional form utilized here is consistent with theoretical expectations and
empirical findings on diminishing returns of emission control (Nordhaus, 1991; 1994). As the
emission reductions increase along the X‐axis, the cost to reduce one additional unit of emission
is increasing in an accelerating speed.
The marginal cost curve of Florida power sector has the following specification:

MC = −53.77 − 87.09 × ln (1 − R )
The fitted curve has an intercept with the Y‐axis at MC = ‐$53.77. The curve increases to MC=0
at the emission reduction level of 46 percent, which indicates that Florida power sector has cost‐
saving mitigation potentials up to the level of about 46 percent of the 2020 BAU emissions.

Analysis of Florida Joining the WCI Cap‐and‐Trade Program in 2020
This study presents the preliminary simulation results of Florida joining the cap‐and‐trade
program of WCI. For the detailed specification of our cap‐and‐trade model, the methodology
we used to develop the marginal cost curves of states/provinces, and the general assumptions
we adopted in the modeling, please refer to the summary “Modeling of cap‐and‐trade
Program” by Adam Rose and Dan Wei.
The eleven WCI partners include seven U.S. states: Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico,
Oregon, Utah, and Washington; and four Canadian provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba,
Ontario and Quebec.13 The WCI cap‐and‐trade program has a broad sectoral coverage, which
includes electric sector, residential/commercial fuel uses, large stationary combustion sources,
industrial process, fossil fuel production and processing, and transportation fuels (basically all
sectors except agriculture, forestry, and waste management). The WCI 2020 regional reduction
target is 15 percent below its 2005 GHG emissions level. According to the findings by the WCI
Economic Modeling Team, nearly one‐third of the WCI total emission reduction requirement
could be achieved by the reductions from the non‐WCI WECC power sector (under the First
Jurisdictional Deliverer (FJD) approach proposed for the WCI cap and trade program, the
portion of emission reductions that relate to the imported electricity to WCI should be reflected
as the WCI BAU reductions). Therefore, in our analysis we assumed that for each WCI partner,
the in‐state (or in‐province) emission reduction goal would be 10 percent below 2005 level by
year 2020. This regional target is applied to each of the ten WCI partners in our analysis.
We first simulated the cap‐and‐trade among the current ten WCI partners (see Table B‐1‐8). The
simulation assumes that the permits are grandfathered. The second column in the table shows
the mitigation cost for each partner to achieve the reduction target before it enters the cap‐and‐
trade program, for example, the cost of each state’s own mitigation activities to achieve the
reduction goal. Negative numbers in this column indicate overall cost savings. The next three
columns (columns 3 to 5) show the mitigation cost, trading cost, and net cost (the sum of
mitigation cost and trading cost) after the partners enter the cap‐and‐trade program. Partners
that have relatively high mitigation costs will accomplish only part of their reduction obligation
by their own mitigation activities, and purchase the remaining permits in the market. Partners
that have relatively low costs will have the incentive to mitigate more than their reduction
targets indicate, so that they can sell their surplus permits to other partners at a profit. In the
Trading Cost column, negative numbers represent revenues from selling permits. Next, the
difference in the net cost between the before trading and after trading conditions is presented in
the Cost Saving column (column 6). The next two columns (columns 7 and 8) show the permits
purchased/sold by each partner and the emissions reduced by in‐state mitigation activities in

13 The Province of Ontario recently joined as a WCI Partner. Time did not permit revisions to this analysis to include
Ontario, and it is likely that these results will change somewhat when Ontario is added. References to the ‘ten’ WCI
partners therefore indicate the fact that Ontario is not included.

quantity terms. The last two columns (columns 9 and 10) show and compare the emission
reductions in percentage terms with and without trading for each partner, respectively.
Table B‐1‐9 presents the simulation results for Florida joining the WCI cap‐and‐trade program.
Table B‐1‐10 presents the 2020 baseline emissions, the emission budget (capped emissions), and
reduction target in percentage terms for the WCI partners and Florida in the first three
numerical columns. Please note that the 2020 emission budget for Florida is computed by
interpolating the state’s 2017 goal (to return to 2000 levels) and 2025 goal (to return to 1990
levels). The last column in this table shows the autarkic (own) marginal mitigation cost level for
each state/province to meet the emission budget.
Figure B‐1‐3 shows the marginal cost curves for all the states and provinces included in this
study.
Summary of the findings from the simulations:
1. The factors that have the greatest influence on all simulations are the absolute levels and
the relative levels of the marginal mitigation cost curves. The former has the greatest
influence on the potential for cost savings, while the latter has the greatest influence on
the extent of permit trading across trading states/provinces, including whether each
state/province is a permit buyer or seller.
2. For many WCI partners and Florida, the total cost of achieving the carbon emission caps
is negative. This means that compliance with the caps will result in overall cost savings.
This result is due to the existence of an extensive range of cost‐saving options, such as
improvements in energy efficiency.
3. Before Florida joins WCI, the permit price of the cap‐and‐trade program among the 10
WCI partners is $78.18/tCO2e. Washington is the biggest permit buyer in the market,
followed by California. New Mexico is the biggest permit seller.
4. Because Florida has a marginal cost curve flatter than the WCI average level, when it
joins the WCI, the permit price decreases to $65.55/tCO2e. Florida is the biggest permit
seller in the market, followed by New Mexico. Again, Washington is the biggest permit
buyer in the market, followed by California.
5. The Florida 2020 state emission reduction goal (which is the interpolation of the state
2017 and 2025 goals) translates to 33.57 percent below the 2020 baseline emissions level
of the cap‐and‐trade covered sectors. Since Florida is projected to be a permit seller in
the market, the state will mitigate more emissions (around 18.46 MMtCO2e) than the
state goal indicates. The surplus permits are sold in the open market and Florida would
earn profits from the trading.

6. In both simulation cases, if we compare the net cost of each state/province after trading
with the corresponding element in the column before trading, we find that all
states/provinces are better off as a result of participating in trading, since all the post‐
trading net costs are smaller than the pre‐trading costs. The cost saving amount is shown
in the Cost Saving column in the result tables (Table B‐1‐8 and Table B‐1‐9). Compared
with the pre‐trading condition, Florida can save $191 million in 2020 by joining WCI, a
cost saving of around 10.26 percent.

tCO2e = metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent; BAU = business as usual.
Permit Price = $65.55/tCO2e. This is the price of the last permit sold, which is also equal to the price of the last ton of
CO2e mitigated (its marginal mitigation cost). It is the same for each state/province for a given case. The average
mitigation cost per unit of CO2 equivalent in the simulation differs for each state/province. For FL, for example, it is ‐
$5.7/tCO2e. Please note that the average mitigation cost is related to mitigation level of a state/province, which for
this case is 38.37 percent below the baseline level in 2020 for FL. Multiplying the average mitigation cost by the
number of tons of CO2 mitigated will equal the total mitigation cost for each state/province shown in the second

Figure B-1-3.
AFW = agriculture, forestry, and waste management; BAU = business as usual; GHG = greenhouse gas.
Notes: 1. Marginal cost curves of AZ, CA, MT, NM, WA, and FL are developed based on mitigation options data of
these states (from state final or draft climate action plans).
2. Marginal cost curves of OR, BC, MB, and QC are developed based on WA, WA, MN, and CT 2020 curves,
respectively. UT only has mitigation options data available for residential/commercial/industrial sector and the
transportation sector. The state emission mitigation potentials and costs for the energy supply sector are
approximated from New Mexico data.
3. The following assumptions are adopted when we develop the cost curve for one state based on the data from one
of its adjacent states. We assume that the list of mitigation options for the adjacent state (state A) is applicable to the
state without direct data (state B). Second, for state B, the estimated cost or cost savings per unit GHG removed for
each option is assumed to be at the same level as that of state A. Third, the mitigation potentials of each option are
assumed to be proportional to the total mitigation potential in each state; this requires that each option be adjusted by
the ratio of emissions from the relevant sector of the two states. For example, if the emissions from the power sector
are 50 MMtCO2e and 100 MMtCO2e in state A and state B, respectively, the mitigation potentials of the ES options
for state A are multiplied by a factor of 2 (100/50=2) for application to state B.

Development of the Marginal Cost Curve for Florida
The Florida marginal cost curve is developed based on the reduction potential and mitigation
cost/saving data of individual mitigation options in the sectors that are covered by the cap‐and‐
trade program. Since the sectoral coverage of the WCI cap‐and‐trade program includes
basically all sectors except agriculture, forestry, and waste management sectors, we collected
the 2020 Florida GHG reduction potential and mitigation cost/saving data of individual options
that are quantitatively analyzed by the ESD and TLU TWGs. Please note, at the time we
undertook this research, only 8 out of the 12 ESD Tier 1 options had been quantified with
respect to their range of applications and costs. Therefore, we could not formally include the 4
un‐quantified ESD Tier 1 options and 7 options listed, but not quantified, as ESD Tier 2 options
in the ESD TWG Policy Description Document. Three TLU options are not quantified by their
TWG as well, and are therefore also not formally included in the list below. Table B‐1‐11
presents only the list of options that have been analyzed by the TWGs in a quantitative manner.
The options not quantified by their TWGs would further enhance the State’s mitigation
potential and likely at costs within the range presented below.
Based on the data presented in Table B‐1‐11, the stepwise marginal cost function of Florida in
2020 is first drawn in Figure B‐1‐11. Next, we fit a smooth curve through the data using
statistical analysis (also see Figure B‐1‐4). The same functional form is used:

MC = a + b × ln(1 − R)
Where, MC is the marginal cost; R is the percentage reduction of GHG emissions; a and b are
parameters.

Note: Table B‐1‐11 only includes climate change mitigation options that are analyzed by the TWGs thus far. Not all
the options recommended by the TWGs have been quantified for emission reduction potentials and cost‐
effectiveness. However, there is no question that these options would attain additional 10 percent CO2e reductions
with respect to the state baseline emissions. Moreover, the cost of these un‐quantified options would fall into the cost
range for the options that have been analyzed. Therefore, we anticipate that Florida would have higher total
emission reduction potentials from the cap‐and‐trade covered sectors than the cumulative reduction potential
number indicated in Table B‐1‐11.
1 2020 projected consumption‐based gross CO2e emission level is 384.69 Million Metric Tons CO2e (excluding AFW
sector).
2 The GHG reduction potential of 2020 is computed as the average of the 2015 and 2025 reduction potentials.

Annex 2. Modeling of Cap‐and‐Trade Program
I. INTRODUCTION OF THE CAP‐AND‐TRADE MODEL
A cap‐and‐trade system has many desirable features for implementing pollution
emission reductions. The cap limits emissions. The trading ensures that the reduction will be
achieved at the lowest possible cost (economic efficiency). The initial allocation of permits can
be used to address issues of fairness (equity).
The model we use for the cap‐and‐trade analysis has been previously developed and
successfully applied to simulate the workings of interregional (and international) C&T systems.
It is based on established economic principles (equilibrium and optimization). The model can
be solved either as a system of simultaneous equations or as a non‐linear programming model.
It has been applied to the analysis of cap‐and‐trade associated with the Kyoto Protocol,
emissions trading within the European Union, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),
ten EPA regions covering all states of the U.S, Midwestern Governors Association (MGA)
region, Minnesota internal state trading, Western Climate Initiative (WCI), and Pacific Rim
states and countries (see Rose et al., 1998; Rose and Zhang, 2004; Rose et al., 2006; CCS, 2008;
Rose and Wei, 2008).
This model is based on the ability of unrestricted permit trading to achieve a cost‐
effective allocation of resources in the presence of externalities (see, e.g., Tietenberg, 2007). For
permit purchasing states (or sectors), compliance costs are equal to own abatement cost plus the
cost of permits, whereas for selling states (or sectors), compliance costs are equal to abatement
cost minus the revenues from selling permits. The model can readily be adapted to include
such alternative design features as: variations in sector and source coverage, implications of the
cap on emission reduction requirements over time, offsets, variations on auctioning, upstream
vs. downstream application, borrowing and banking, and any explicit constraints on the permit
price or trading (see Stevens and Rose, 2002; CCS, 2008).
The model yields the following general results:
•
•
•
•
•
•

GHG emission reductions (abatement and sequestration) for each entity (sector and/or
state) before and after permit trading
Cost (or cost savings) of GHG emission reductions for each trading entity before and
after trading
Number of permits traded (bought and sold) by each entity
Equilibrium permit price
Cost savings for each entity of joining the cap‐and‐trade program
Auction revenues if the allowances are auctioned among trading entities instead of
grandfathered

Appendix B

______________________________________________________________________________

The model uses as inputs (all the following input data are collected from the state’s
Climate Change Action Plans):
•
•
•

Projections of baseline GHG emissions for each trading entity
Caps on GHG emissions for each entity (translated from the state reduction goals in
target years)
Marginal cost curve of GHG emission reduction for each entity based on the cost of all
relevant mitigation/sequestration options

II. DEVELOPMENT OF MARGINAL COST CURVES
Many states have developed State Climate Change Action Plans. The following data for
each mitigation option (that has been quantitatively analyzed) of these states are first collected:
•

The range of the mitigation option’s application (maximum percentage of total
emissions that can be reduced by the option)

•

The cost per ton of CO2 that can be reduced (this is specified in terms of a cost‐
effectiveness, including the possibility of cost savings per unit GHG removed)

For each state, the mitigation options are then ordered from lowest cost to highest cost.
A step function is developed based on the mitigation potential and cost per ton of CO2
reduction for each policy option. Such a step function is illustrated in Figure B‐2‐1. Next, a
smooth curve is developed to fit the step function, which would be used as the marginal cost
curve of the state in cap‐and‐trade policy analysis.

Prior CCS analysis for Minnesota can serve as an example of the construction of the
mitigation marginal cost curve. Table B‐2‐1 presents 8 example climate mitigation options out
of the 37 options analyzed in a quantitative manner for Minnesota by CCS. Column 2 of the
table presents the estimated 2025 annual GHG reduction potential for each option, with
reduction potentials translated into percentages of the 2025 BAU emissions level in Column 4.
The estimated cost or cost saving per ton of GHG removed by each option in 2025 is presented
in Column 3. The options are ordered in ascending sequence in terms of cost, beginning with
the cheapest option. Column 5 calculates the cumulative GHG reduction potentials of the first n
policy options listed in the table. The last column presents the proportion of GHG mitigation
contributed by each option.

Minnesota 2025 projected consumption-based gross GHG emission level is 200.46 Million Metric Tons of CO2e.

Based on the data presented in Table B‐2‐1, the stepwise marginal cost function for
Minnesota in 2025 is first drawn in Figure B‐2‐2. The horizontal axis represents the percentage
of GHG emissions reduction, and the vertical axis represents the marginal cost or savings of
mitigation. In the figure, each horizontal segment represents an individual mitigation option.

B‐38
Appendix B

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
The width of the segment indicates the GHG emission reduction potential of the option in
percentage terms. The height of the segment relative to the x‐axis shows the average cost
(saving) of reducing one ton of GHG with the application of the option. The figure indicates
that, collectively, the reduction potential of options from all economic sectors can avoid about
44 percent of 2025 baseline emissions in Minnesota. Our approach to develop the marginal cost
curve based on state specific climate change action plans directly includes any introduction of
new emission reduction technologies (such as carbon capture and storage) of the state.
Furthermore, sensitivity analyses of mitigation options, for example, to account for different
learning and penetration effects or technological innovations, can be readily reflected in the cost
curve by variations in the width (usually lengthening) and height (usually lowering), as well as
the sequencing of the corresponding segments of the options.
Next, we fit a smooth curve through the data using statistical analysis (see Figure B‐2‐2).
We weight each policy option based on its GHG mitigation potential to give relatively greater
influence to those options that have the potential for higher levels of application. This fitted
curve will then be used in our cap‐and‐trade analysis model.
The fitted curve shown in Figure 2 has the following functional form:

MC = a + b × ln (1 − R)
Where, MC is the marginal cost; R is the percentage reduction of GHG emissions; a and b
are parameters.

and empirical findings on diminishing returns of emission control (Nordhaus, 1991; 1994). As
the emission reductions increase along the X‐axis, the cost to reduce one additional unit of
emission is increasing in an accelerating speed.
The marginal cost curve for Minnesota has the following specification:

MC = −63.37 − 220.25 × ln(1 − R)
The fitted curve has an intercept with the Y‐axis at MC = ‐$63.37. The curve increases to
MC=0 at the emission reduction level of 25 percent, which indicates that Minnesota has cost‐
saving mitigation potentials (such as energy efficiency) up to the level of about 25 percent of the
2025 BAU emissions.
III. GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS ADOPTED IN THE ANALYSIS
The general assumptions we adopted in the cap‐and‐trade analysis and our modeling
can be summarized as follows:
Emissions:

______________________________________________________________________________

•

All six GHGs — CO2, methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs),
perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) — from the covered sectors are
included in the analysis.

•

The gross emissions (excluding forestry and agriculture soils sinks) are considered.

Marginal Cost Curves:

•

Marginal cost curves embody direct mitigation costs only.

•

Marginal cost curves do not include various transactions costs.

•

Marginal cost curves do not distinguish between producer vs. consumer allocation of
permits.

•

For states that lacks direct cost data, the cost curve is approximated based on the data of one
of its adjacent states that has quantified cost data available. We assume that the list of
mitigation options for the adjacent state (state A) is applicable to the state without direct
data (state B). Second, for state B, the estimated cost or cost savings per unit GHG removed
for each option is assumed to be at the same level as of state A. Third, the mitigation
potentials of each option are assumed to be proportional in each state; this requires that each
option be adjusted by the ratio of emissions from the relevant sector of the two states. For
example, if the emissions from the power sector are 50 MMtCO2e and 100 MMtCO2e in state
A and state B, respectively, the mitigation potentials of the ES options for state A are
multiplied by a factor of 2 (100/50=2) for application to state B.

•

For analysis of cap‐and‐trade among power sectors, the power sector marginal cost curves
of the states are developed based on the reduction potential and mitigation cost/saving data
of individual options that contribute to the emission reductions from power sector. These
options not only include those designed directly for the electricity supply sector (such as
promotion of renewable energy utilization, repowering existing plants, generation
performance standards, etc.), but also include options in RCI sectors that contribute to the
reduction of electricity consumption (e.g., demand‐side management, energy efficiency
appliances, building codes, etc.). Also, for those options that apply to the use of both
electricity and other fuel types, the emission reduction potentials are adjusted by
multiplying the percentage of electricity consumption to total energy consumption in the
RCI sector. RCI options that relate entirely to reduction of other fossil fuels consumption
(such as gas, oil) are not included in the power sector cost curve development.

Basic model (can be included in advanced versions):

•

Offsets are not included.

•

No safety valve (permit price limit) is included.

•

Recycling of auction revenues is not analyzed in the simulations.

IV. SPECIFICATION OF THE CAP‐AND‐TRADE MODEL
The cap‐and‐trade model is based on well‐established principles of the ability of
unrestricted permit trading to achieve a cost‐effective allocation of resources in the presence of
externalities (see Tietenberg, 2007). Where a strict cap implies unique GHG emission reduction
requirements, the individual state and overall regional optimization can be accomplished
without explicit consideration of the benefits side of the ledger (i.e., it yields “efficiency without
optimality”). Therefore, the model simply requires equalization of marginal costs of all entities
with the equilibrium permit price (see, Zhang, 2000; Loeschel and Zhang, 2002; Rose and
Zhang, 2004). This ensures minimization of total net compliance costs for each state and
minimization of total abatement costs for the region as a whole. For selling states (high cost
states), they will reduce emissions up to the point where their marginal cost equals the
prevailing market permit price, and accomplish their remaining reduction responsibility by
purchasing available permits in the market. For purchasing states (low cost states), they would
have the incentive to do more than their reduction targets indicate, so that they can sell their
surplus permits on the open market to obtain profit. For the region as a whole, permit sales and
purchases cancel out, simplifying the overall objective functions.
We assume that the marginal abatement cost function for state i is of the logarithmic
form, similar to Nordhaus (1994):14

MC i = ai + bi × ln (1 − Ri )

i=1, ... ,n

(1)

where MCi is the marginal cost of abatement for state i, Ri is the percentage of greenhouse gas
abatement undertaken by state i in million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e), and ai
and bi are cost parameters. This functional form has the desired property of positive and
increasing marginal cost for bi < 0. When ai = 0, the cost curve starts from the origin. When ai < 0,
the curve can show the cost‐saving mitigation range of the state. These cost parameters also
capture technological and other distinctions that cause mitigation costs to differ across regions.
By integration, the total cost of abatement for region i, TCi, is:
Ri

TC i = ∫ [ai ⋅ Ri − bi ⋅ (1 − Ri ) ⋅ ln(1 − Ri ) − bi ⋅ Ri ] ⋅ Ei

i=1,...,n

(2)

0

14 The shape of the cost function for mitigating carbon emissions has been studied extensively. For example,
Nordhaus (1994) found that the logarithmic functional form provided the best fit for the estimates of the marginal
costs of mitigating a specific amount of carbon emissions among a number of economic modeling studies that he
surveyed (a type of meta‐analysis). Nordhaus (1994) used an analytical model to further derive a logarithmic
relationship between the marginal costs and the percentage reduction.

where Ei is each state’s gross (unabated) emissions in MMtCO2e. Denoting the total required
percentage reduction of emissions in region i in the absence of emissions trading as R i , the total
abatement cost for each state in the absence of trading, TCRi , is calculated as:

[

Ri

]

TC R i = ∫ [(ai + bi ⋅ ln(1 − ri ) )dri Ei ] = ai ⋅ R i − bi ⋅ (1 − R i ) ⋅ ln(1 − R i ) − bi ⋅ R i ⋅ Ei
0

i=1,...,n

(3)

Emissions trading helps a region with relatively high marginal abatement cost to lower
its compliance cost by avoiding the undertaking of autarkic actions. To minimize compliance
costs, a purchasing state undertakes only some of its abatement requirement itself, Ri Ei ,

Ri Ei

Ri Ei , up to the point where the marginal cost of doing so is equal to the endogenously

determined permit price, P:

MC i = ai + bi × ln (1 − Ri ) = P

i

N

(4)

where N is the set of all states.

(

)

The state meets the remaining demand, Ri Ei − Ri Ei , via purchasing the “right to emit”
at the regional market price, P. So, the total demand for emission permits of all purchasing
states, TD, is:

TD = ∑ (Ri Ei − Ri Ei )

i

N

(5)

i

On the other hand, for state j, with relatively low marginal cost, emissions trading
provides it an incentive to undertake abatement and sell permits to those higher‐cost states at
the equilibrium permit price, P:

MC j = a j + b j × ln (1 − R j ) = P

j

N

(6)

The total amount of emissions permits available for sale in a given regional trading
coalition TS, is:

(

TS = ∑ R j E j − R j E j

)

j

N

(7)

j

The sum of total number of purchasing states i and total number of selling states j will
be equal to n. At the equilibrium, the total demand for emissions permits in the region is equal
to the total supply:

TD = TS

(8)

Substituting Eq. (5) and Eq. (7) into Eq. (8) and rearranging terms yields the condition
that the total emissions actually abated equal the total emission abatement requirement:

Eq. (4), (6), and (9), using GAMS, an algebraic modeling system for linear, nonlinear, and
integer programming problems (Brooke et al., 1996).15 The solution yields the equilibrium
permit price (P),
each state’s own abatement after trading Ri Ei , and each state’s marginal abatement cost
(MCi). Because we focus on unrestricted emissions trading, in equilibrium the marginal cost
of abatement for each region is the same and is equal to the permit price, indicated in Eq. (4)
and Eq. (6).
This completes the description of the general model by which the permit price, MCi, and
RiEi are determined endogenously in a competitive market. In the case where the permit price
is set exogenously, as in the case of some auctions, the situation becomes simpler because MCi
and hence RiEi follows suit. There is no need for Eqs. (5), (7), (8), and (9) because the total sales
of selling states to purchasing states are not equal to the total purchases, except by chance
(when the specified permit price equals the equilibrium price).

The market equilibrium solution of our model is unique, so the same solution could be obtained without
optimizing. The reason why we specify an objective function is that we use GAMS/MINOS, a solver mainly for
optimization problems. The minimization of the total cost is a logical choice for an objective in the case of “cost‐
effectiveness” analysis here (i.e., when a policy target is set and decision units seek to attain it at least cost). Had we
used a software package that is specifically designed to solve a simultaneous equation system, then there would have
been no need for an objective function.

Common Assumptions
Policy analysis of transportation and land use issues is inherently complex, given the
interrelationships between transportation systems, land use, and other important aspects of
societal well‐being. Policy analysis methods for transportation and land use, as conducted by
consultants for the Center for Climate Strategies, (CCS), is based upon many years of well‐
established professional practice and methods that are widely accepted in the fields of public
policy analysis, urban and transportation planning, transportation engineering, and
environmental sciences.

Underlying Premises and Methodology
As much as possible, the analysis is conducted using simple spreadsheet modeling techniques
in which assumptions are transparent. To ensure consistent results across recommendations,
common factors and assumptions are used for the following items:
•

Independent and integrated analyses—Each recommendation is first analyzed
individually and then addressed as part of an overall integrated analysis.

•

Fuel costs and projected escalation—Fuel cost estimates are based on common sources
wherever possible. For example, fossil fuel price escalation is indexed to the U.S.
Department of Energy (US DOE) projections as indicated in their most recent Annual
Energy Outlook (AEO).

•

Consumption‐based approach—The analysis uses a consumption‐based approach where
emissions are calculated on the basis of the consumption of transportation fuels to
provide energy to Florida consumers, as opposed to a production‐based approach,
which considers the emissions from in‐state production of transportation fuels.

•

Life cycle GHG approach—Life cycle GHG emissions are considered on a case‐by‐case
basis. The primary focus of the analysis of Transportation and Land Use issues is upon
the direct combustion of transportation fuels to provide energy.

•

Overlap with other Sectors—Where Transportation and Land Use (TLU)
recommendations overlap with recommendations being considered in other Sectors, the
analysis for these recommendations is conducted in close coordination with the
assumptions and other inputs used in other CCS analyses.

Data Sources
Technical Working Group (TWG) members are often in a good position to obtain and provide
data sources that are specific to Florida, and these are used as much as possible. Where Florida‐
specific information cannot be readily obtained from the TWG, the analysis relies on published
data from the DOE, national laboratories, and other state climate change processes as follows:
1.

Baseline Historical Energy Consumption by Sector
C‐2

Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Historical energy consumption in the State, by sector, is from the DOE Energy
Information Administration (EIA) State Energy Data, available at
http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/_seds.html.
2.

Baseline Historical Vehicle Fleet, Fuel Use, and Travel Activity Data
Baseline data on the State vehicle fleet is incorporated from the MOBILE model,
as specified in the Florida Inventory and Reference Case Projection report.
Baseline fuel use is obtained from the most recent US DOE Energy Information
Administration (EIA) reports, as described in the Florida Inventory and
Reference Case Projection report. Baseline travel activity data in the form of
vehicle miles traveled were developed by the Florida Department of
Transporation (DOT) from linear extrapolation of historical Florida vehicle miles
traveled (VMT) data, per the Florida Inventory and Reference Case Projection
report. State‐specific vehicle registration data was available and incorporated
into the analysis of TLU‐2 and TLU‐7.

3.

Baseline Forecast GHG Emissions
Baseline forecasts of future GHG emissions for the transportation and land use
sector, data sources, and methods of analyses for these forecasts are described in
the Florida Inventory and Reference Case Projection report.

4.

Energy Price Projections through 2030
Energy prices by region are from the EIA Supplemental Tables to the AEO 2007,
with projections through 2030. Adjustments to the EIA projections are made on a
case‐by‐case basis.

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 contains a provision to increase the
corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) of light‐duty vehicles (passenger cars and light trucks)
to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The Florida Inventory and Reference Case Projection does not
include the CAFE or biofuels provisions (or any other provisions) of the Energy Independence
and Security Act of 2007. Increases in vehicle fuel economy resulting from this Act would lead
to reduced CO2 emissions from onroad vehicles. While adjustment of the reference case
projection to account for the Act was deferred to a later date, the effect of the new CAFE
standards was accounted for in the estimates of GHG reductions from the various TLU policy
recommendations discussed below.

Cost Inclusion
The analytical methods being used can incorporate a wide variety of costs, depending on the
availability of cost state. Fuel costs are incorporated into all analyses where relevant. Other
types of costs are explicitly considered in the analysis if they can be readily estimated.
Types of costs that are incorporated include:
•

Annualized capital costs levelized (amortized),
C‐3

Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
•

Operations and maintenance costs, and

•

Administrative costs.

Types of costs that are not incorporated include:
•

External costs, such as the monetized environmental or social benefits and impacts (e.g.,
the cost of damage by air pollutants on structures and crops), quality‐of‐life
improvements, and health impacts and benefits (e.g., improved road safety);

•

Energy security benefits; and

•

Macroeconomic impacts related to reduced or increased consumer spending, and
shifting of cost and benefits among different sectors of the economy.

Cumulative (Overlap) Analysis
In addition to estimating the impacts of each individual policy recommendation, the combined
impacts of the TLU policy recommendations was estimated, assuming that all policies were
implemented together. This involved eliminating any overlaps in coverage that would occur to
avoid double counting of impacts. Also, overlaps between policy recommendations in the TLU
sector and policies in other sectors were identified. The following section identifies where these
overlaps occurred and explains the methods used to adjust the impacts analysis to avoid double
counting of impacts.

Method for Analyzing Cumulative Impacts of Combined TLU Policies
It is widely accepted that there are three general categories of factors that impact the emission of
GHGs from the transportation sector. These three general categories are often described as “the
three‐legged stool.” The three categories (or three legs of the stool) are vehicle characteristics,
fuels, and travel activity.
These three factors interact in a complex fashion to have an effect on GHG emission levels. The
following formula summarizes this interaction in a simplified fashion: Vehicle Miles Traveled
divided by Miles per Gallon multiplied by MMtCO2e/gallon yields MMtCO2e. Thus, the GHG
emissions reductions resulting from individual stand alone policies are not additive. For
example, a policy that reduces vehicle‐miles traveled (VMT) will reduce the GHG benefits of a
policy that improves fuel economy or reduces fuel carbon intensity.
The cumulative GHG emissions reductions that would result if all eight TLU policies described
below were to be implemented as a package was estimated by identifying the potential for
overlap between the policies as follows:
•

TLU Policies 1 through 7 affect the light‐duty vehicle fleet, while TLU Policy 8 affects the
heavy‐duty vehicle fleet. Thus, there is no overlap between TLU Policies 1‐7 and TLU
Policy 8.

C‐4
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
•

TLU Policies 1 through 7 were grouped into three categories: policies affecting VMT,
policies affecting vehicle fuel economy, and policies affecting the carbon intensity of
fuels used. TLU Policies 3, 4, 5, and 6 all affect VMT. TLU Policies 2 and 7 affect vehicle
fuel economy. TLU Policy 1 affects the carbon intensity of fuels used. The overlap
within each of these three groups was determined.

•

As a final step, the overlap between each of the three categories was estimated and
applied.

The net cumulative GHG reductions from implementation of all eight TLU policies was found
to be approximately 9 to10 percent lower than the sum of the individual policy impacts. The
overlap amongst policies affected the cumulative costs, as well as the GHG reductions. The net
cumulative costs were found to be approximately 12 percent lower than the sum of the
individual policy costs.

Overlap of TLU Policies with Other Sectors
TLU Policy 1 overlaps with policies related to biomass/biofuels in the Agriculture, Forestry and
Waste (AFW) sector. Adjustments were made to the AFW policies to account for the overlap.
There are no additional overlaps between TLU policies, and policies in other sectors.

TLU-1. Develop and Expand Low-GHG Fuels

The 10 billion gallons of imported transportation fuel used annually in Florida is responsible for
40 percent of the greenhouse gas (GHG) production, creates a significant imbalance in trade,
and contributes to our strategic dependence. Oil prices increased by 100 percent between July
2, 2007, and July 1, 2008, with no end in sight, increasing the cost of gasoline and damaging the
economy of Florida as well as that of other states. Increased efficiency and the development of
alternatives could mitigate these adverse effects. Development of large‐scale, domestic,
alternative fuels will provide a cost‐competitive alternative that can stabilize the value of
automotive fuels and other petroleum‐derived products and stimulate local economies.
Alternative fuels from biomass, cellulosic residues, and energy crops have been identified by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of Energy (US DOE) as
our best near‐term opportunity to reduce oil dependence and GHG emissions. The Sunshine
State of Florida ranks near the top in potential production of energy crops and residues
(agricultural, forest, and municipal) for ethanol fuel. Development of this new industry in
Florida will require substantial commercial investment and could result in more than 200
advanced biofuels plants that would directly employ more than 12,000 individuals around the
state.
The 2008 Federal Farm Bill (HR‐2419) has an excellent program (Biomass Crop Assistance
Program) to mitigate farming risks for energy crops which has not been sufficiently publicized
in Florida and will greatly assist the development of this new industry. This Farm Bill also
defines “advanced biofuels” very broadly to include liquid and gaseous fuels made from any
renewable biomass except the starch from corn (to include the most current definition for
advanced biofuel from the recently passed Farm Bill.)
The existing federal legislation and the 2006 Florida Energy Act provide incentives in the form
of income and sales tax credits for investments in the production, storage, and distribution of
biodiesel and ethanol. However, the Florida credits terminate on June 30, 2010, and are subject
to relatively low statewide caps on the amount of credits allowable.
Alternative fuels can have a key role in the transformation of the energy sector, climate
stabilization, and the renaissance of rural areas. There are “good” and “bad” alternative fuels
depending on how they are produced, used, and traded which, in turn, determines their
ultimate economic, environmental, and social impacts. Alternative fuel production, trade, and
use must be cost‐effective, equitable, and sustainable.
TLU‐1 recommends the following to develop and expand low‐GHG and alternative fuels:

•

Integrate and better coordinate policy frameworks.

•

Assess and monitor benefits and impacts of alternative fuels production, trade, and use.

C‐6
Appendix C

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Address negative indirect effects of alternative fuels production, trade, and use.

•

Reward positive impacts and investments attained through carbon management.

•

Build consensus for new projects by supporting informed and continuous dialogue
engaging all relevant stakeholders.

•

Increase investments in research, development, and demonstration.

Public policy with regard to investment in research and development (R&D) should focus on
the production of cost‐effective, second‐generation alternative fuels; build on sustainability
lessons learned from first‐generation alternative fuels to be used for second‐generation
alternative fuels; increase conversion technology performance; and maximize climate change
mitigation. In addition, public policy should:

•

Build capacity to enable producers to manage carbon and water,

•

Make sure that trade policies and climate change policies work together, and

•

Open competition in the transport sector to all recommendations and methods that can
displace carbon and imported oil, including demand reduction.

Policy Description
This recommendation seeks to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the carbon intensity of
vehicle fuels sold in Florida. A low‐carbon fuel standard (LCFS) would require all fuel
providers in Florida to ensure that the mix of fuel they sell into the Florida market meets, on
average, a declining standard for GHG emissions measured in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e)
per unit of fuel energy. The state should develop, with industry and stakeholder input, a set of
standards for low‐carbon fuels, which include biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, hydrogen,
compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, electricity, and low‐carbon blends such as E10
or E85. The standard would be measured on a life cycle basis in order to include all emissions
from fuel production to consumption.
Fuel providers (defined as refiners, importers, and blenders of on‐road vehicle fuels) will need
to report on an annual basis that the fuel mixtures they provide to the market meet the LCFS.
Fuel retailers should be encouraged to provide this information to consumers at the point of
sale to the extent that the information is available.

Policy Design
Goals: Create an LCFS for transportation fuels (gasoline and diesel) sold in Florida that would
reduce the carbon intensity of Florida’s on‐road vehicle fuels. In addition to the reduction
standard and program timing, life cycle model and boundary conditions should be addressed in
creating the program.
Timing: Following the design period, the program proposal for standards would be reviewed,
discussed, and decided upon in the appropriate legislative venue.

Implementation Mechanisms
A Governor’s Executive Order would initiate the process for development of the LCFS,
followed by a detailed report. The appropriate state agencies will undertake a study to develop
the framework for the LCFS. Once the study is completed, it would be introduced to the state’s
legislative proceedings, at which point the appropriate state agency will conduct public
hearings on the proposal. Once adopted, an appropriate state agency will initiate a rulemaking
proceeding that establishes and implements the LCFS.
The LCFS is market‐based and performance‐based, allowing averaging, banking, and trading to
achieve the lowest cost and consumer‐responsive solutions. An LCFS is also fuel‐neutral, where
fuel providers will choose which fuels to sell and in what volumes.
Fuel providers—defined as refiners, importers, and blenders of passenger vehicle fuels—would
demonstrate on an annual basis that the fuel mixtures they provide to the market meet the
target by using credits previously banked or purchased.

Renewable Energy Grants
The Renewable Energy Technologies Grants Program
(http://www.dep.state.fl.us/energy/energyact/grants.htm) provides matching grants for
demonstration, commercialization, research, and development projects relating to renewable
energy technologies, including those that generate or use hydrogen or biomass resources
(reference Florida Statutes 377.804).
The potential interaction between federal and state policy actions related to the Renewable Fuel
Standard (RFS) at the national level and various state and regional GHG mitigation policies is
worth understanding to most effectively formulate state and regional policies within the
existing context of federal policies regarding transportation fuels.
The most recently passed federal law, the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of
2007, expanded the federal Renewable Fuel Standard significantly. Under the new law, fuel
suppliers are required to blend nine billion gallons of renewable fuel into gasoline in 2008. Fuel
suppliers must increase the amount of renewable fuel blended into transportation fuels
annually to reach a level of 36 billion gallons in 2022.
In the United States, a significant amount of gasoline is currently being blended with a
relatively small portion of alternative fuel in the form of ethanol. Virtually all light‐duty motor
vehicles in a fleet can handle gasoline blended with ethanol when ethanol makes up 10 percent
or less of the volume of the fuel. The nation is quickly moving toward a standard of a minimum
of 10 percent ethanol blended into gasoline to serve multiple goals: increasing use of alternative
fuels, reducing reliance upon imported petroleum and petroleum products, reducing air
pollution by producing cleaner burning fuel, and reducing GHG emissions from the
combustion of transportation fuels.
In comparison with the nine billion gallon renewable fuel requirement for 2008, the United
States consumed roughly fi ve billion gallons of biofuels in 2006. The U.S. ethanol industry has

C‐10
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
successfully increased the amount of production from an estimated 1.8 billion gallons in 2001 to
an estimated 6.5 billion gallons in 2007.
The 2022 RFS goal of 36 billion gallons is not likely to be achievable through corn ethanol alone,
and the EISA limits the amount of corn ethanol that may be credited toward the RFS goals at
15 billion gallons beginning in 2015. The remainder of the RFS goal—21 billion to 36 billion
gallons—is expected to be reached through “advanced biofuels.” As a result, the federal policy
expects that advanced, or “second‐generation” biofuels, will be commercially available in 2015
and will provide the majority of the fuel to meet the federal RFS in the longer term.
State governments and regional associations of state governments are considering and adopting
a range of policies to reduce GHG emissions from the combustion of transportation fuels.
Included in this set of policies are those that overlap or interact to some extent with the federal
RFS as formulated in the 2007 EISA. The low‐carbon fuel standard (LCFS) is the policy most
often considered by individual states as a means to reduce the carbon intensity of transportation
fuels being used.
There are two other sets of policies considered by states that may complement the federal
policies. One set of policies would incentivize or provide for increased capacity for production
and blending of alternative fuels and distribution of those fuels to fuel stations. The other set of
policies would incentivize or provide for increased capacity of motor vehicle fleets to use blends
of fuel that reduce the portion of petroleum‐based products below the 90 percent threshold for
gasoline and the 95 percent threshold for diesel fuel; these policies would also increase the
percentage of alternative fuels (corn ethanol, advanced biofuels, and other renewables) above
the 10 percent (E10) threshold for gasoline blends and the 5 percent (B5) threshold for diesel
blends. Some policies that fall into this second category include promotion of flex‐fuel vehicles
that can safely and effectively use the higher blends of fuels and provision of the fuel station
infrastructure necessary for pumping these higher blends.

In this scenario (Table C‐1‐3), by 2025, ethanol sales in Florida would represent 23 percent of
gasoline sales. For analysis purposes, ethanol was assumed to be used in the form of either E10
or E85. In reality, flex‐fuel vehicles will be able to operate on any blend of ethanol up to 85
percent. The analysis assumptions are intended to reflect that range of blends. In addition, 95
percent of ethanol is assumed to come from corn feedstocks, with 5 percent from sugarcane in
2011, with a 90 percent corn/10 percent sugarcane mix assumed from 2011 to 2015. Starting in
2016, it is assumed that cellulosic ethanol would begin to make up a significant portion of the
ethanol market. Biodiesel (from soy) is assumed to make up 10 percent of total Florida diesel
sales by 2025.
Figure C‐1‐1 illustrates the assumed blends of ethanol and biodiesel as percentages of gasoline
and diesel, respectively, as well as the overall renewable fuel blend and estimated resulting
reduction in average fuel carbon intensity. The cumulative impact of this increase in biofuels is
anticipated to be approximately a 6 percent reduction in average fuel carbon intensity in 2020
and approximately an 8 percent reduction in 2025.
Cost is calculated as the incremental cost of biofuels per gallon of gasoline equivalent (for
ethanol) or diesel equivalent (for biodiesel) multiplied by total consumption of each fuel.
Ethanol and gasoline prices in future years are drawn from the Energy Information
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook, June 2008. Based on information from the U.S.

Department Energy’s Alternative Fuels Price Report, July 2008, the difference in the average
price of biodiesel compared with conventional diesel in the Lower Atlantic region is
approximately $0.05 per gallon (less for biodiesel). Note that the cost calculation does not
include Federal subsidies in the form of tax credits for ethanol or biodiesel. In addition, costs
related to any vehicle upgrades (for example, flex‐fuel vehicles that can operate on ethanol
blends up to E85) are not included. The market for inputs into biofuels production and also for
the biofuels themselves exhibit a significant level of volatility. There is a significant level of
uncertainty about the likely future costs of production and the market price of biofuels,
although it has been argued that biodiesel will be priced competitively with diesel in the future
in order to maintain market viability.1

Key Uncertainties
Transportation fuel providers would need to undertake changes in their production and
distribution methods in order to achieve the goals. Because the policy does not prescribe
particular technology pathways, there is uncertainty surrounding which fuels and technologies
fuel providers will use to meet the standard. The program assumes that providers will use the
most cost‐effective recommendations to meet the standard, but costs are unknown at this time.
The market for inputs into biofuels production and also for the biofuels themselves exhibit a
significant level of volatility. There is a significant level of uncertainty about the likely future
costs of production and the market price of biofuels.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Use of biodiesel reduces diesel particulate matter emissions, which have adverse public health
effects. Use of ethanol also reduces air pollutant emissions.

Feasibility Issues
There are feasibility issues associated with transporting large volumes of biofuels to and within
the state, as well as distributing biofuels to consumers. For example, ethanol has historically not
been moved in the pipeline network used for transport gasoline and diesel fuel. However, the
pipeline industry is currently in the process of adapting technology for pipeline distribution of
ethanol.

TLU-2. Low Rolling Resistance Tires and Other Add-On Technologies

Low‐rolling‐resistance (LRR) tires can reduce vehicle fuel use and associated carbon dioxide
(CO2) emissions. A 10 percent reduction in rolling resistance improves fuel economy by
approximately 1‐2 percent for an average passenger car. The theoretical limit for fuel savings
(assuming 100 percent reduction in rolling resistance) has been estimated at about 14 percent for
passenger cars. Differentials of 20 percent or more in rolling resistance have been found among
currently available new tires having the same size, traction characteristics, and speed ratings.
Manufacturers currently use LRR tires on new vehicles, but they are not easily available to
consumers as replacement tires. When installing original equipment (OE) tires, carmakers use
LRR tires as a way to contribute to meeting the federal corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)
standards. When replacing the original tires, consumers often purchase less efficient tires. For
example, while the majority of OE passenger tires have rolling resistance coefficients (RRC)
between 0.006 and 0.010, the range for replacement passenger tires tends to be higher with the
RRC’s between 0.007 and 0.014. An average passenger tire has an RRC of 0.01, the high end of
the range for OE passenger tires.
Both design and operation characteristics affect the rolling resistance of tires. A tire’s
construction, geometric dimension, material types, formulation, and volume all affect its rolling
resistance. A tire’s tread has a particularly major affect on rolling resistance, but can also affect
tire life and the resultant number of scrap tires, and therefore may not be a desirable means for
improving rolling resistance. On the operations side, load, inflation pressure, alignment, and
temperature all affect a tire’s rolling resistance.
Thus, there are three avenues by which the rolling resistance of tires may be reduced, and fuel
economy improved as a result:
o

Consumers could purchase more tires that are now available and have lower rolling
resistance;

o

Tire designs could be modified and new technologies could be introduced to reduce
rolling resistance;

o

Vehicle operations could be improved, especially through improved maintenance of tire
inflation.

Currently, tire manufacturers and retailers are not required to provide information about the
fuel efficiency of replacement tires. In addition, there is no current minimum standard for fuel
efficiency that all replacement tires must meet. State policy and action can help bridge this gap
through a variety of mechanisms. State policy can improve the fuel economy of the light duty
vehicle (LDV) fleet by setting minimum energy efficiency standards for replacement tires and
requiring that greater information about LRR replacement tires be made available to consumers
at the point of sale. Information can also be provided to consumers about fuel efficiency and
C‐15

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
cost in relation to the purchase, maintenance, and operation of their vehicles. State policy can
encourage or provide information on complementary add‐on technologies that could facilitate
vehicle operation practices that improve fuel efficiency.
One example of these technologies would be the addition of ‘real‐time’ indicators of miles per
gallon (mpg) for those vehicles that do not already provide such information to motor vehicle
operators. The installation of technologies that provide drivers with current fuel efficiency
(mpg) information has the potential to increase driver awareness of fuel consumption rates
under different vehicle operating conditions.
In addition to receiving real‐time information on mpg while their vehicles are in operation
through mpg indicators, drivers could also receive alerts when tire pressure is too low through
devices such as the Air Alert Valve Caps. Generally, a set of four light‐emitting diode (LED)
self‐calibrating tire pressure valve caps such as Air Alert cost about $22.00, and real‐time mpg
monitoring systems such as ScanGauge are about $100.00.

Policy Design
Goals: Require that replacement tires be LRR tires that achieve an average 4.0 percent gain in
fuel economy for the light‐duty vehicle (LDV) fleet, including light‐duty trucks, without
reducing tire lifetime or otherwise increasing the lifecycle carbon footprint of the tires.
Timing: The requirement would phase in beginning in 2011, reaching the 4 percent gain no later
than 2030. Intermediate targets may be set as necessary to ensure achievement of the policy
goal as soon as feasible.
Parties Involved: State government; automobile and industries.

Implementation Mechanisms
An appropriate state agency would initiate a fuel‐efficient tire replacement program. The
program could include consumer education, product labeling, and minimum standards
elements. The program would include consideration of the technical feasibility and cost of such
a program, the relationship between tire fuel efficiency and tire safety, potential effects upon
tire life, and impacts on the potential for tire recycling. In addition, the program may determine
it necessary to exempt certain classes of tires that sell in low volumes, including specialty and
high‐performance tires.
The minimum standard is likely to be less stringent than the standard for energy efficiency of
original equipment tires. Such a regulation would improve the fuel efficiency of the overall
LDV fleet but not necessarily the fuel efficiency of all tires since consumers would still make
choices in the marketplace. The replacement tires in the future would be on average more fuel
efficient than those historically purchased, but are likely to be, on average, not as fuel efficient
as the tires included as original equipment by the automobile manufacturers.

______________________________________________________________________________

Information and Education
Provide information to the general public and commercial businesses (for example, taxi and
food delivery services) that use LDVs for daily business explaining that improved fuel
efficiency is directly related to the decreased rolling resistance of a vehicle’s tires. Information
on the potential annual cost savings of using LRR tires would also be provided. For example, a
car averaging 15,000 miles/year would have annual fuel savings of about $100. A chart of
recommended tire models would be included with information on product labeling and
minimum standards elements. Best scientific information, including the results from tests
conducted by the tire manufacturers, the California Energy Commission, and the National
Academy of Sciences (NAS), would be reviewed and incorporated.
The manufacturers of the LRR tires would be contacted to encourage the promotion of their
products through regional newspaper and television advertising. The producers of LRR tires
may freely provide promotional materials.

Promotion and Marketing
State lead by example—The state will lead by example by initiating a fuel‐efficient replacement
tire program. This would include all‐weather fuel‐efficient tires and would require legislative
approval for rental rates for vehicles, both owned and leased.
Over time, all state fleet tires in need of replacement will be changed to LRR tires, if available
for the vehicle type and season.

•

Encourage procurement of LRR tires for other vehicle fleets. Encourage local/county
governments to act consistently with standards and support state procurement on their
behalf.

•

Encourage federal agencies located within the state to act in accordance with and support
state actions.

•

Encourage businesses that depend on vehicles to conduct their daily business to act in
accordance with and support state actions.

Voluntary LRR standards—Establish voluntary LRR standards that achieve an average 4.0
percent gain in fuel economy.
Marketing program—Develop a marketing program for tire dealers and consumers to encourage
the purchase of LRR tires. This effort might include a voluntary labeling program for tire fuel
efficiency.
University research—Encourage the Florida University System to conduct research on alternative
noncombustible applications for used tires.
Web site—All state‐supported programs would have dedicated detailed Web sites. In addition to
information and materials, program participation and success stories by the various
governmental agencies and individual businesses would also be documented and extolled.

C‐17

______________________________________________________________________________
Technical assistance—Contact the LRR manufacturers and tire distributors to coordinate
objectives and obtain technical support for outreach materials.
Funding mechanisms and/or incentives—Replacement of tires on state fleet vehicles is already
budgeted through the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) annual funding processes.
Voluntary and/or negotiated agreements—Work with the manufacturers and affected parties to
achieve objectives with flexibility in their timelines.
Codes and standards—The State of California and Germany have developed substantial
information pertaining to LRR tires because of legislative actions that require tires to be
replaced with more efficient ones. Their documentation identifies testing methods and LRR
standards. The appropriate state agency can review the information and establish suitable
Florida standards.
Pilots and demonstrations—Coordinate with product developers to help them promote their
technologies.
Reporting—The state will develop a system for tracking purposes so it can eventually determine
the turnover to LRR tires and the benefits achieved from the conversion. A simple tracking
system would be established relatively easily by contacting the primary tire distributors of the
major Florida cities on an annual basis, and estimates can be gathered from their inventories.
Enforcement—No enforcement actions will be necessary when the program is instituted as a
voluntary program. After mandatory labeling is in effect, spot checks at the primary tire
distributors in the main Florida cities would be conducted annually by the county health
departments and state staff.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
In October 2003, California adopted the world’s first fuel‐efficient replacement tire law (AB 844
[Assembly Bill 844]). This law directed the California Energy Commission to develop a State
Efficient Tire Program that includes the following elements: (1) develop a consumer education
program, (2) require that retailers provide labeling information to consumers at the point of
sale, and (3) promulgate through a rule development process a minimum standard for the fuel
efficiency of replacement tires sold. The California rule development process began in January
2007. More information about the California Fuel Efficient Tire Program may be found at:
http://www.energy.ca.gov/tires/

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
It was assumed that this policy would have the effect of improving the fuel economy—by 4
percent on average—of all light‐duty gasoline and diesel vehicles (including light‐duty trucks)
that installed replacement tires in 2030. It was assumed that this improvement would be phased
in linearly over a 20‐year time frame starting in 2011 and ending in 2030. For example, fuel
economy is assumed to improve by 0.20 percent in 2011, by 0.40 percent in 2012, and so on until
the maximum 4 percent improvement is attained in 2030. The improvement applies to all

“Tires and their rolling resistance characteristics can have a meaningful effect on
vehicle fuel economy and consumption.”

The report’s conclusions listed above guided development of this policy’s goal level and timing.
2003 California Study
CCS also evaluated the 2003 California study. The 2003 California Study, commissioned by the
California Energy Commission, found that about 300 million gallons of gasoline per year can be
saved in that state with LRR tires. The study also found that a set of four LRR tires would cost
consumers an estimated $5 to $12 more than conventional replacement tires. The fuel‐efficient
tires would reduce gasoline consumption by 1.5 percent to 4.5 percent, saving the typical driver
up to $145 over the approximately 50,000‐mile life of the tires, assuming a $1.53/gallon gasoline
price, according to the study. Consumers would save more than $470 million annually at
current retail prices or approximately $1.4 billion over the 3‐year lifetime of a typical set of
replacement tires.
VEGA Tool Methodology
The VEGA Tool was developed by the CCS team to support their role in the Florida State
Climate Action Plan process, to conduct analysis of various policies affecting GHG emissions
from the on‐road transportation sector.
Figure C‐2‐1 illustrates schematically how the VEGA Tool operates. The grey boxes represent
the inputs required: State GHG Inventory and Forecast data, existing actions, recent actions,
and the policy recommendations to be analyzed. The tool helps the analyst quantify the
existing actions, recent actions, and policy recommendations by translating them into three
aspects of on‐road transport that affect on‐road vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases:
1. Fleet Characteristics: Types of vehicles being driven?
o

Fuel Economy: The average miles per gallon for each model year and vehicle class

o

Vehicle Class Distribution: The portion of the vehicle fleet falling into each of the 28
vehicle classes defined by the Mobile6 model (light‐duty gas vehicles, light‐duty gas
trucks – type 1, …)

o

Fleet Turnover Rate: The rate at which new cars are introduced and older cars are
retired from the vehicle fleet

The above parameters, also illustrated in figure C‐2‐2, can be adjusted by the analyst to best
reflect a given action or policy recommendation. The VEGA Tool then combines these
parameters to estimate what the greenhouse gas emissions would be should the policy be
implemented.
The LRR tire policy affected the fuel economy parameter. It was assumed that the
improvements in fuel economy resulting from the LRR tire policy would phase in linearly over
a 20 year timeframe starting in 2011 and ending in 2030. For example, fuel economy was
assumed to improve by 0.20 percent in 2011, by 0.40 percent in 2012, and so on until the
maximum 4 percent improvement was attained in 2030. Only vehicles scheduled to replace
tires during a given year would have improved fuel economy. A tire replacement schedule was
estimated for each vehicle class based on average mileage accumulation rates available from
EPA’s Mobile6 model and assuming that vehicles replace tires approximately every 45,000

Once all of the parameters have been defined, the tool uses the following general methodology
to estimate fuel savings and GHG reductions. The vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and fuel
economy (mpg) are combined to estimate fuel consumption (gallons). The difference between
fuel consumption under baseline and policy recommendation conditions is the estimate change
in fuel consumption which would result from implementation of the policy recommendation.
C‐22
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
The estimated change in fuel consumption is translated into an estimated change in greenhouse
gas emissions.
For this analysis, the baseline fuel consumption assumed that the new Federal CAFE standards
were in effect.

Key Assumptions:
The estimate of costs associated with LRR replacement tires accounts for faster tire wear
(assuming that tires have lower tread) and an increase in the cost of production that is passed
through to consumers. According to the 2006 TRB Report, consumers would pay an additional
$12.00 per year to replace tires (including installation), and they would pay an additional $1.00
per tire due to increased production costs. This is a conservative assumption regarding
consumer costs. The 2006 TRB Report policy points out that “…if tire life is shortened by as
little as five percent, all or a significant portion of the annual fuel savings associated with lower
rolling resistance would be offset.”
On the other hand, the GHG reductions estimated for this policy assume that there would be no
reduction in average tire life as a result of this policy. A reduction in tire wear life would
increase the number of tires purchased, as well as the number of scrap tires, thus increasing the
overall carbon footprint associated with tire use. In terms of GHG reductions, it is preferable
that tire wear life be maintained (not be reduced) as a result of implementation of this policy.

Key Uncertainties
The LRR fuel‐efficient tires program could begin to be implemented based upon existing off‐
the‐shelf technologies and products that already exist in the consumer marketplace.

Additional Benefits and Costs
This analysis focused on the effects on tailpipe emissions resulting from the LRR tire policy.
Additionally, costs or benefits may accrue from changes to the life cycle costs associated with
tire production and tire scraps depending on the methods employed to improve the average
rolling resistance of the replacement tire population. For example, some methods for reducing
rolling resistance would reduce tire life offsetting a portion of the greenhouse gas reductions
and cost savings. But, there are technically and economically feasible ways to improve rolling
resistance without degrading tire life. Policies and regulations can be crafted to ensure that tire
life is maintained. This policy should be implemented so as to minimize negative impacts on
life cycle costs and weigh them against the benefits of improved fuel economy and reduced
GHG emissions.

TLU-3. Smart Growth Planning

Policy Description
Smart Growth Planning looks at how land use planning, site planning, and urban design at the
community level can help achieve carbon and GHG emission reduction goals. The essence and
intention of smart growth within the context of climate change is to establish a policy
framework, clear guidelines, and measurement parameters for the development of new (and the
redevelopment of older) human habitat communities that will have a net‐zero‐carbon effect on
the general environment and reduce overall GHG emissions. This can be accomplished through
the complex interactions of the three primary elements of community development that have a
direct impact on GHG emissions and affect climate change:

•

Construction energy and building lifetime energy use—measured by the protocols of
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEEDTM) Green Building Rating System,
Green Globes, or the Florida Green Building Coalition (FGBC);

•

Individual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) generation and other transportation energy use (for
example, deliveries, maintenance, buses, security, health, fire, and safety) necessary to
support human communities; and

•

The changing of land uses from carbon‐sequestering land uses (for example, forests,
agriculture, parks, and wetlands) to carbon‐releasing land uses (for example, building sites
and roadways) and development patterns.

Taken singularly in isolated policies, these three factors—land use changes, individual VMT
and transportation energy use in necessary daily lifestyle support, and the life cycle energy use
of buildings—may not be able to achieve the necessary reductions in GHG emissions to meet
climate change goals. Considered together in an integrated set of policies and guidelines,
however, they can accomplish the goal of a carbon‐neutral footprint for human community
activities.
There are multiple levels at which VMT generation can be managed. This section focuses on
VMT generation from land use planning, site planning, and an urban design perspective at the
community level. In addition to this, the following policies focus on reducing VMT by
transportation system management (TSM; covered in TLU‐4), increasing mode choices (TLU‐5),
and land use–transportation coordination (TLU‐6). Smart growth planning also helps reduce
VMT.
In the aggregate, measured at various levels of development from small to large, the balance of
carbon‐sequestering and carbon‐releasing land uses must at least balance and eventually
become negative in releasing carbon to reduce GHG emissions and reverse existing adverse
trends in our atmosphere.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
In accordance with Florida’s schedule for increasing standards for both building energy
efficiency and appliance energy efficiency outlined in HB 697 and HB 7135, community
development and redevelopment patterns should follow a similar schedule of reduced overall
energy use and increased efficiencies, thereby reducing GHG emissions and the energy and
resources necessary to provide all the requisites for human lifestyle support.

Policy Design
Goals:
•

Require that municipalities increase the penetration of green initiatives into all aspects of
their operations and programs by adopting an approach that encourages internal and
external stakeholders to work together to develop integrated energy and environmental
solutions to reduce GHG emissions through multi‐pollutant prevention, environmental
improvements, greater operational efficiency, and expanded public acceptance of green
initiatives.

•

Require that community development proposals submitted for review are certified by
LEED, Green Globes, FGBC, or other approved certification to ensure that the new
development results in a net reduction in GHG emissions relative to a business as usual
(BAU) baseline scenario.

•

Encourage and incentivize communities to adopt programs requiring buildings larger than
a certain number of square feet (sq ft)—for example, 25,000 sq ft or 50,000 sq ft—to have
LEED Silver, Green Globes, or the FGBC certification.

•

Develop and adopt a State of Florida minimum set of Green Building Standards (as has been
developed in California and is being considered in other states).

•

Work with LEED, Green Globes, and FGBC to establish both standards and a review
methodology to ensure that new development and its location results in a net reduction in
GHG emissions relative to a BAU baseline scenario.

•

Minimize GHG emissions from development through a phased‐in approach with both
short‐term and long‐term goals.

•

Encourage compact urban development and mixed use development.

•

Maximize the ability to appropriately retrofit existing buildings using development
standards. Address the retrofitting and remediation of existing buildings through
consideration of both existing development and redevelopment as appropriate.

•

Encourage pedestrian‐friendly development and urban infill development.

•

Encourage and incentivize communities to adopt and support LEED‐ND (LEED‐
Neighborhood Development), Green Globes neighborhood design, or the FGBC
neighborhood design standards, currently in the pilot project testing phase.

C‐26
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Require that local governments adopt site planning and urban design standards that help
reduce VMT and GHG emissions, such as:
○

Encourage communities to adopt design standards that increase street network density
and connectivity in new development and redevelopment projects (for example, reduce
cul‐de‐sacs and increase street network densities)

○

Encourage pedestrian friendly environments by

–

Create design guidelines that require main entries of all residential, retail, and
commercial buildings to be directly accessible from sidewalks;

–

Incentivize greater sidewalk coverage in all future residential, commercial, and retail
developments (meaning that all streets within such developments should have
sidewalks);

–

Provide incentives to design or locate residential projects consistent with LEED,
Green Globes, or the FGBC standards to encourage a greater proportion of dwelling
units to be developed within a one‐half mile walking distance of at least two or more
commercial, retail, or entertainment centers.

○

Encourage mixed use development that increases the job–housing balance by giving
incentives to increase floor area ratio (FAR) for mixed use projects

○

Encourage or require compact development. Encourage counties and municipalities to
adopt incentive programs that allow building owners to exceed building height and
density limits if a building meets the LEED, Green Globes, or the FGBC standards. This
will help reduce emissions from VMT as well as from building operations

Timing: Establish a consortium of universities to provide both research and training to local,
state, and regional officials as they implement the goal that new development does not increase
GHG emissions.
Parties Involved: Local, state, and regional governments, private property owners,
development companies, and investors.

Implementation Mechanisms
Maximize the opportunities to retrofit existing buildings to meet LEED, Green Globes, FGBC, or
other approved certification programs to reduce energy consumption and thus reduce GHG
emissions.
Establish incentives and promote redevelopment projects that establish more energy‐efficient
land use patterns. Redevelopment should result in a mix of uses that result in a reduction of
VMT when compared with the existing land use pattern.

______________________________________________________________________________
Governments and government agencies are beginning to require that all new buildings meet
certain LEED, Green Globes, and the FGBC certification threshold standards. In 2003, for
example, the U.S. General Services Administration, which manages 1,800 federal buildings,
began requiring all new building projects to strive for the LEED Silver, Green Globes, or the
FGBC standards and, at a minimum, to meet the LEED, Green Globes, or the FGBC standards
for basic certification.
State‐Level Initiatives: Governors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Maryland, New Mexico,
and Rhode Island have signed recent executive orders requiring all new construction to meet
LEED requirements. Other state and local governments have enacted similar requirements.
Financial Incentive Programs: Governments are also creating financial incentives to build
green. In July 2005, the Pennsylvania Legislature created incentives rewarding new schools that
were built to meet LEED Silver, Green Globes, or the FGBC certification requirements.
Development Incentives: In Arlington, Virginia, innovative incentive programs allow building
owners to exceed building height and occupant density limits if a building meets LEED, Green
Globes, or the FGBC standards. The permissible zoning variances increase for buildings that
meet even higher standards—LEED Silver, Gold, and Platinum. In addition, buildings that fail
to meet the LEED, Green Globes, or the FGBC standards are asked to contribute $0.03/sq ft to a
Green Building Fund, that educates the public about the value of green building.
Tax Incentives: Other states, including Maryland, New York, and Oregon, provide tax
incentives to encourage builders to meet LEED requirements. Santa Monica, California, and
Issaquah, Washington, provide for the accelerated review of building permits to boost green
construction.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Potential levels of GHG emissions reductions are not estimated at this time. Many development
characteristics are location‐dependent and, as a result, are complex to aggregate to a statewide
level. Some portions of the GHG emissions reduction potential are incorporated into
complementary policy actions in TLU, AFW, and ESD sectors.
An important indication of the potential for savings comes from analyses of LEED‐certified
buildings. The most obvious benefits from green buildings relate to lower environmental and
operating costs, that result from improved energy and water efficiency. Green buildings have
documented energy‐efficiency improvements ranging from 25 percent to 65 percent, and water‐
efficiency improvements up to 90 percent. The resulting financial savings are sufficient to offset
any concerns about potential small increases in initial cost.
It is recommended that the State of Florida undertake a study to estimate the potential energy
savings and GHG emissions reductions associated with different scenarios for development,
with a focus on the numerous urban metropolitan areas within the state.

TLU-4. Improving Transportation System Management (TSM)

Policy Description
Transportation System Management is the concept of pairing transportation demand with
transportation supply to help transportation networks serve the demand in an effective and
efficient manner. Effective system management may utilize a variety of strategies based on
advanced technologies, market‐based incentives, regulations, and design standards. Each
strategy provides a relatively small benefit to GHG reduction, but when applied in concert,
substantial gains can be achieved. TSM strategies attempt to reduce the number of trips being
taken by single‐occupant vehicles (SOVs), shorten trip lengths, reduce vehicle delay, increase
the reliability of the transportation network, and reduce idling and other transportation actions
that result in increased GHG emissions. The goal of TSM is to reduce the daily VMT per capita
on the transportation network. Effective TSM will also reduce vehicle hours traveled (VHT) per
capita, which measures the amount of traffic congestion delay. Reduction of either VMT or VHT
is highly correlated with a reduction in GHG emission.
TSM attempts to both improve transportation system performance and alter travel behavior
through a combination of technological improvements, incentives, design, and restrictions.
Technological improvements include traffic signal coordination, lane management, traveler
information displays, and other intelligent transportation system applications. Incentives can
include policies that financially favor desired behavior or allow users to gain a time advantage
and include value pricing and smart parking strategies. System design is also important since
infrastructure and technology can be adapted to encourage less driving, and it includes access
management applications and intersection improvements. Finally, users can be barred from
performing certain actions that would negatively impact the efficiency of the transportation
system. TSM policies can be instituted at every level of government. Some can have a virtually
instant effect, while others require many decades to reap full benefits.

Policy Design
Goals: Develop and implement policies and strategies that include program funding, financial
and development incentives, infrastructure investment, and regulatory requirements to
promote transportation system management improvements that result in reduced VMT and/or
VHT which, in turn, result in reduced GHG emissions. These actions, taken in concert with
other aggressive transportation and land use policy actions, should be designed to reduce urban
area VMT by 7–10 percent by 2020 and by 9–12 percent by 2050; VHT can be reduced by
amounts that are associated with these VMT reductions. VHT reduction is recognized as a
means of reducing driver delay while also reducing excess fuel consumption in congested
traffic.

______________________________________________________________________________

•

Reduce existing and future trips and trip lengths in an effort to reduce both VMT and VHT.
Driving less, in terms of both hours and miles driven, will result in a decrease of GHG
emissions. This can be achieved through the aggressive implementation of specific
transportation demand management strategies and coordinated transportation and land use
decision making.

•

Distribute existing and future trips in terms of both time and geography—when trips are
taken and where trips are taken—in order to reduce congestion and smooth traffic flow.
Reducing congestion and smoothing traffic flow by changing people’s driving patterns—
either by changing the time of day they drive or the route they take—will result in less
idling and stop‐and‐go driving. This will reduce VHT and GHG emissions and can be
achieved through increased investment in supporting transportation infrastructure,
implementation of specific TSM strategies, and the aggressive implementation of specific
transportation demand management strategies.

•

Improve transportation system operations to improve travel conditions on the
transportation network. This includes traffic signal coordination, real‐time traveler
information, advanced computerized lane and parking space management, value pricing at
toll locations, intersection improvements such as roundabout conversions, advanced
incident management, and other traffic operations applications. This will reduce the
frequency of transportation actions that contribute to high levels of GHGs (for example,
jackrabbit starts, idling, and excessive braking). It will require an increased investment in
TSM‐related infrastructure and aggressive implementation of non‐capacity operational
strategies that improve the flow of vehicles on the transportation network.

Timing: TSM strategies have a variety of implementation time frames. Some, such as
workplace‐based strategies, can begin implementation almost immediately. Others that are
based on infrastructure construction will have an implementation timeline of four to 10 years.
Systemic changes to the urban landscape have the longest horizon—up to 25 years.
Parties Involved: State government agencies (FDOT, Florida Department of Community Affairs
[DCA], and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection [DEP]), regional government
(metropolitan planning organizations [MPOs], regional planning councils [RPCs], and regional
transportation authorities [RTAs]), local transportation providers (public transit agencies,
airports, seaports, and expressway/bridge authorities), and local governments.

Implementation Mechanisms
Collectively, the implementation mechanisms recommended under this policy attempt to
reduce GHG emissions by enhancing system efficiency and modifying travel behavior and
conditions through TSM strategies. Those strategies will require a combination of program
funding, financial and development incentives, infrastructure and technology investment, and
regulatory requirements implemented at the local, state, and regional levels.

Reduce Existing and Future Trips and Trip Lengths: These implementation mechanisms are
intended to result either in the reduction of trip lengths or the complete elimination of certain
trips. This will result in a reduction of both VMT and VHT that will reduce GHG emissions.
Implementation mechanisms intended to reduce trips and trip lengths include

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public and private sector employers to implement telework
programs for eligible employees. This will result in fewer work‐based vehicle trips.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public and private sector employers to implement job‐sharing
programs for eligible employees. This will result in fewer work‐based vehicle trips.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public and private sector employers to implement
carpooling/vanpooling programs for eligible employees. This will result in fewer work‐based
vehicle trips.

•

Require and/or incentivize enhanced coordination between land use and transportation decision
making to reduce distances between clusters of affordable housing and employment
opportunities. This will reduce work‐based vehicle trip lengths.

Distribute Existing and Future Trips in Terms of Both Time (When a Trip Is Taken) and
Geography (Where a Trip Is Taken): These implementation mechanisms are intended to
change peoples driving patterns and behaviors (either by changing the time of day that they
drive or the route that they take), resulting in reduced congestion and smoother traffic flows.
Reducing congestion and smoothing traffic flow will result in less idling and stop‐and‐go
driving which, in turn, will result in fewer GHG emissions. Implementation mechanisms
intended to change people’s driving patterns and behaviors include

•

Encourage and incentivize transportation facility operators to implement value‐pricing
(variable‐pricing) policies. This will encourage travelers to change the time of day they make
various types of trips and result in fewer vehicle trips during peak operating hours.
Alternatively, this will encourage travelers to change the routes by which they make various
types of trips and will result in a more even distribution of vehicle trips across the
transportation network.

•

Encourage and incentivize public and private parking facility operators to implement smart
parking policies. This will encourage travelers to change the time of day they make various
types of trips and will result in fewer vehicle trips during peak hours.

•

Encourage and incentivize local governments and private developers to build up the
supporting transportation network (e.g., lower functional class street network), improve local
transit routes that support express bus routes and premium transit options, and construct
more sidewalks and bike paths). This will encourage travelers to make appropriate route
and mode choices and result in a more even distribution of vehicle trips across the
transportation network.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize public and private sector employers to implement flex time and
compressed time programs for eligible employees. This will result in fewer work‐based vehicle
trips during peak hours and, in the case of compressed time programs, fewer work‐based
trips overall.

Improve transportation system operations to reduce occurrences of transportation actions that
contribute to high levels of GHGs (e.g., jackrabbit starts, idling, and excessive braking). These
implementation mechanisms are intended to maximize the efficiency of the transportation
system through the application of technology and advanced design. Management of the supply
of transportation capacity through the application of various technologies and design strategies
will result in reduced congestion and smoother traffic flows which, in turn, will result in less
idling and stop‐and‐go driving and reduced GHG emissions. Implementation mechanisms
intended to change people’s driving patterns and behaviors include

•

Increase investment in intelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies at all levels. In
particular, investment should be focused on technologies that smooth the flow of traffic
(e.g., reducing congestion, braking, and idling), resulting in a reduction of VHT and GHG
emissions.

•

Increase investment in incident management programs and technologies. Quickly responding
to incidents will reduce the negative impacts that incidents have on the smooth flow of
traffic. Incident management can also include roadside assistance programs such as FDOT’s
“Road Rangers.” Incident management will result in a reduction in incident‐related stop‐
and‐go traffic, in turn reducing VHT and GHG emissions.

•

Increaseinvestment in traffic signal coordination. This will smooth the flow of traffic on the
roadway network and result in reduced idling, braking, and jackrabbit starts, in turn
reducing VHT and GHG emissions.

•

Encourage and/or incentivize access management programs at all levels, particularly those that
coordinate land use and transportation decision making. This will reduce conflicts on the
roadway and make vehicular movements more predictable (including for transit vehicles,
bicyclists, and pedestrians). It will also result in smoother traffic flows and reduced stop‐
and‐go traffic conditions, reducing VHT and GHG emissions.

•

Increase investment in traveler information technologies will provide travelers with a more
predictable travel experience and let them make rational choices that maximize their
efficient use of the transportation network. This will result in less congestion and VHT and,
in some cases, reduced VMT.

•

Increase investment in managed lanes technology. Real‐time lane management allows for the
more efficient flow of vehicles through the transportation network, maximizing available
capacity and smoothing traffic flow. This will result in less congestion and VHT and, in
some cases, reduced VMT.

TLU-5 and TLU-6. Increasing Choices in Modes of Transportation and Factoring
GHG Emissions into Transportation and Land Use Planning Processes

Policy Description
A. Factoring GHG Emissions into Transportation and Land Use Planning Processes
This recommendation seeks to ensure that local and state land use and transportation planning
considers the impact of land use and transportation decisions on the reduction of GHG
emissions. Transportation accounts for the second largest contributor to GHG emissions in
Florida and represents approximately 40 percent of emissions in Florida.
Florida has a long history of comprehensive planning by local governments, the cornerstone of
which was the enactment and amendment of the Local Government Comprehensive Plan
(LGCP) and Land Development Regulation Act. Each local government is required to adopt a
comprehensive plan that contains certain required elements: a capital improvements element; a
future land use plan; a traffic circulation element; a general sanitary sewer, solid waste,
drainage, potable water, and natural groundwater aquifer recharge element; a conservation
element; a recreation and open space element; a housing element; a coastal management
element (where appropriate); and an intergovernmental coordination element. Local zoning
codes and land development regulations must be consistent with the policies articulated in the
comprehensive plan.
In addition to the comprehensive plan, Florida has adopted as the cornerstone of its growth
management transportation framework, a policy called concurrency. The policy is based on the
premise that public facilities shall be in place concurrent with or prior to the impacts of a
particular development. “Concurrency in Florida is tied to provisions in the state growth
management act, requiring the adoption of level of service standards, elimination of existing
service deficiencies, and provision of infrastructure to accommodate new growth reflected in
the comprehensive plan. Plans and development regulations must aim at achieving and
maintaining the desired level of service, and comprehensive plans are reviewed by the state for
consistency between the capital improvement element and the various elements of the plan,
including the future land use plan.”2
With respect to transportation facilities, the general rule is that transportation facilities needed
to serve new development shall be in place or under construction within three years after the
local government approves a building permit or its functional equivalent that results in traffic
generation. The implementation of transportation concurrency has been problematic, and the
Florida Legislature has adopted a number of exceptions to the general policy. First, in 2005,
proportionate fair share mitigation, or “pay and go” option for concurrency, was adopted that
“allows developments to proceed under certain circumstances, notwithstanding a failure to

meet transportation concurrency, where applicants contribute their fair share of the cost of
improving the transportation facility.”3 The improvement must be financially feasible within a
10‐year time frame and be in or added to the five‐year capital improvements element. Second,
specific exceptions from the concurrency requirement are provided for certain public
transportation facilities, infill or redevelopment projects, and projects whose impacts are
considered insignificant or de minimis.
It is generally accepted that the implementation of the concurrency policy in Florida has had the
unintended consequence of encouraging developers to build outside existing urban cores
because of the lack of excess transportation capacity within these areas, thereby requiring
expensive transportation improvements to meet concurrency standards. Development outside
of the urban core results in longer trips (both commuting and non‐commuting) that yield more
VMT. Lower density development at the urban fringe and ex‐urban development contributes to
the premature conversion of natural and agricultural lands, thereby reducing the GHG
buffering capacity of the landscape.
During the 2008 session of the Florida Legislature, the Legislature adopted HB 697, which was
signed into law on June 17, 2008. The new law requires local governments to include in their
local government comprehensive plans policies that address energy efficiency and the reduction
of GHGs. The following elements of the comprehensive plan are amended to require

•

Future Land Use Element—includes energy‐efficient land use patterns and GHG reduction
strategies.

•

Traffic Circulation Element—includes strategies to reduce GHG reductions.

•

Housing Element—addresses energy efficiency in design and construction of new homes.

HB 7135, amends the State Comprehensive Plan to include goals related to energy and global
climate change. The bill also provides that each metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is
encouraged to consider strategies that integrate transportation and land use planning “to
provide for sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”
On a broader scale, long‐range visioning activities being conducted at the community and
regional levels in Florida are identifying alternatives to current growth practices. Regional
visioning enable communities to develop a comprehensive approach to planning for future land
use, transportation, conservation, economic development, housing, and other community
needs. It provides an opportunity for regions to alter current growth patterns, thus modifying
future transportation needs and associated energy consumption by enabling people to make
fewer trips, make shorter trips, or use alternative transportation modes.
In addition, FDOT produces the Florida Transportation Plan (FTP), a long‐range plan that
identifies the goals and objectives for the next 20 years to address the needs of the state

______________________________________________________________________________
transportation system. The FTP is a plan for all of Florida, not just FDOT, and establishes a
policy framework to guide investment in the transportation system by all public and private
partners.
A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is made up of local elected and appointed officials
responsible for coordinating transportation planning in a metropolitan area of at least 50,000
people. The 26 MPOs in Florida are responsible for developing long‐range transportation plans
(LRTPs) and programs, and for setting transportation funding priorities for the metropolitan
areas (s. 339.179, F.S.). These LRTPs are developed based upon future land use and growth
assumptions contained in the LGCPs. FDOT’s five year work program is developed based on
the project priorities submitted annually by the MPOs and county commissions from counties
not included in MPO areas.

B. Increasing Choices in Modes of Transportation
An important strategy in reducing GHG emissions produced from transportation sources is
reducing the growth rate in VMT per capita. Providing modal alternatives to the single‐
occupancy vehicle (SOV) can reduce the number of trips on the highway system and VMT per
person. Modal alternatives can include bus transit, rail transit, paratransit, ridesharing,
greenways, on and off‐road bicycle facilities, and all types of pedestrian facilities.
Public transit vehicles generate much lower levels of GHGs per person‐mile than SOVs. The
challenge is that transit (bus and rail) accounts for only two percent of trips made in the United
States today, compared with percent percent in Canada and 10 percent in Western Europe.4 An
expansion of transit services will require a substantial increase in funding for both
infrastructure and operations. Increased transit use is key to reducing the growth rate of VMT.
A higher rate of transit use can be achieved by expanding transit services, increasing transit’s
competitiveness with other modes, ensuring safety and security of transit systems, and
educating the public about transit options available in their community.
Many employers partner with local governments and nonprofit agencies to promote and fund
local carpooling and vanpooling programs. These rideshare alternatives, combined with
employee incentives, telecommuting, and parking strategies are often effective in reducing
travel demand and ultimately, VMT. High‐occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes or high‐occupancy
toll (HOT) lanes on major transportation corridors can encourage ridesharing by providing
reduced travel times and/or tolls for vehicles carrying multiple passengers.
Bicycling and walking do not generate GHGs. A convenient and comprehensive bicycle and
pedestrian network can be a pleasant, stress‐free option to driving on congested roadways.
Although each modal alternative by itself may not significantly reduce GHGs, an integrated
system of bicycle, pedestrian, and public transportation facilities could provide a significant
benefit in enhancing mobility while reducing the growth rate in VMT.

Policy Design
A. Factoring GHG Emissions into Transportation and Land Use (TLU) Planning
Processes
Goals:
6.1—All local government comprehensive plans shall be revised to include policies and
objectives that address energy‐efficient land use and GHG reduction strategies, including
policies that:

•

Increase density within the urban service area;

•

Prioritize compact development and maximize internal trips within the development;

•

Prioritize transit‐oriented development within urban service areas and encourage the use of
transit;

•

Prioritize affordable workforce housing in proximity to major employment centers;

•

Prioritize targeted infrastructure investments in GHG‐efficient locations;

•

Encourage the reduction of trip length and vehicle hours of delay; and

•

Prioritize the preservation of green space, natural, and agricultural areas.

Florida DCA is initiating a rulemaking process to comply with recently passed state law on
these issues.
6.1(a)—Any future plan amendment must be supported by data and analysis to demonstrate
how the amendment is based upon energy‐efficient land use patterns and GHG reduction
strategies.
6.1(b) — Require local governments to adopt minimum densities that apply within the urban
development boundary or urban service area.
6.2—By December 31, 2009, all local governments shall adopt land development regulations
that implement the amended policies that address energy efficiency and GHG reduction
strategies.
6.3—By July 1, 2009, amend the LGCP and Land Development Act to allow local governments
to enact mobility fee structures as an alternative to transportation concurrency.
6.4—By December 31, 2010, amend the FTP to develop goals, objectives, and strategies for
addressing climate change, reducing GHG emissions, and providing modal alternatives to
highways for travel.
6.5—By July 1, 2010, review state law to identify programs that fund capacity improvements
and should be amended to include GHG emissions in the funding criteria.
C‐39
Appendix C

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
6.6—By July 1, 2010, modify the Efficient Transportation Decision Making (ETDM) process to
include climate change considerations (for example, VMT and GHG emissions) in the
evaluation of candidate projects for long‐range transportation plans and the five‐year
transportation work program.
6.7—All MPOs should address expanding transit options and reducing GHG emissions during
the update of LRTPs and subsequent development of project priorities.
6.8—By July 1, 2009, require all transportation authorities to give priority to projects that reduce
VMT and consider the GHG impact of constructing new roads.
6.9—By date 2020, reduce VMT and associated VHT within urban service areas by 10 percent on
a per capita basis, through land use and other supportive travel reduction strategies. Start goal
levels with 10 percent and then project out for the other milestones in the Governor’s Executive
Order until at least 2025. The Florida GHG emissions targets established under the Governor’s
Executive Order 07‐126 are 10 percent below current levels by 2012, 25 percent below current
levels by 2017, and 40 percent below current levels by 2025.
6.10—By July 1, 2009, establish growth policies that provide incentives for developing regional
visions that integrate transportation and land use planning to provide for sustainable growth
and reduce GHG emissions.
6.11—Assess Impact Fees Programs for effectiveness and suggest improvements to incentivize
reductions in GHG emissions impacts.
6.12—Reevaluate level of service (LOS) standards for local governments.
6.13 Federal, state, regional and local governments should seek to leverage and expand funding
opportunities to meet current and future public transportation needs(for example, expand
authority to levy the Charter County Transit Surtax to all counties).
6.14 — FDOT and DEP should work with the US Department of Transportation and
Environmental Protection Agency to improve modeling tools for assessing GHG emissions for
transportation plans and projects. Once developed, these modeling tools should be used to
evaluate the GHG emissions impact of transportation choices.
6.15— Maximize the use of existing transportation infrastructure before building new roads.

B. Increasing Choices in Modes of Transportation
Goals: Double transit ridership to equal levels found in Canada. The scenario for analysis
shows a doubling of ridership by the year 2025. Increase the percentage of people that walk,
bicycle, carpool, vanpool, or telecommute. Develop and implement policies and strategies that

C‐40

______________________________________________________________________________
include program funding and financial incentives that expand non‐automobile infrastructure
and provide modal alternatives to SOV travel.
Timing: 1–30 years.
Parties Involved: Public transit agencies, local governments, MPOs, RTAs, FDOT, and local
businesses.

Implementation Mechanisms
A. Factoring GHG Emissions into Transportation and Land Use (TLU) Planning
Processes
To assist local governments in implementing the requirements of HB 697, the Florida DCA
should prepare model comprehensive plan policies to address the new policies required in the
Future Land Use Element, Traffic Circulation Element, and the Housing Element. Provisions in
Florida law that govern the Florida Transportation Planning Process should be amended to
require consideration of GHG reduction in setting and prioritizing transportation projects.
Priority should be given to projects that reduce GHG emissions or encourage compact
development in urban areas. RTAs should also be required to consider GHG reduction in the
setting of project priorities.

B. Increasing Choices in Modes of Transportation
Improve Availability and Accessibility of Service
•

Create new public transportation systems and options, including bus rapid transit (BRT).
New transit systems and routes can serve areas presently without transit, or they can add
new destinations from areas currently served.

•

Encourage local governments and developers to provide and expand bicycle and pedestrian
networks. A more complete infrastructure will entice travelers to shift from SOVs to
walking or bicycling for appropriate trips. Better bicycle and pedestrian access also
promotes transit use, since all transit trips begin and end as pedestrian trips.

•

Create new rail systems for passengers and freight. Work with rail companies to expand
intercity passenger services. Partner with ports and rail lines to expand freight rail facilities
to reduce the need for trucks on the roadways and incorporate rail services in the planning
and design of new transportation corridors.

•

Construct new and/or expand existing HOV or HOT lanes. This will encourage travelers to
shift from SOVs to HOVs for all types of trips, particularly during peak hours. Transit
vehicles can also use HOV/HOT lanes to gain a time advantage over using standard traffic
lanes.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

Increase the Competitiveness of Alternative Modes
•

Increase investment in public transit systems to provide more frequent service and longer
service hours, making transit more time competitive with SOV travel. This will encourage
travelers to shift from automobiles because their wait time for their needed bus or train will
be shorter.

•

Hold steady or decrease the user cost of transit, making transit more cost competitive with
SOV travel. As fuel prices increase, people will find significant cost savings in moving to
alternative modes. Group discounts and employer pass programs can also reduce the cost to
the user.

•

Increase capital investment and management procedures to ensure reliability of transit
service. Users, particularly those who can afford a car, will be more likely to use transit if
the service is reliably on time.

•

Simplify and streamline the use of transit by requiring fewer transfers.

•

Allocate preferred and discounted parking spaces to vanpools and carpools.

•

Offer “guaranteed ride home” programs to those who regularly use transit, vanpools, or
carpools. Under these programs, people who must work beyond their usual shift ending
time receive free or discounted taxis or door‐to‐door transit. This gives flexibility to the
worker’s schedule and encourages the use of alternative modes.

Ensure That Alternative Modes Are Safe and Secure
•

Public transportation must be secure. Patrons should be able to observe law enforcement
and counterterrorism procedures and feel safe while using public transportation services.
The public is mindful of the vulnerability of mass transit systems, and people are more
likely to ride if they feel secure.

•

Crime must be kept to minimum on the streets and on transit. If the streets are not safe,
people will not walk or ride a bicycle. Similarly, if transit vehicles and stations are unsafe,
everyone who can drive will do so.

•

Passengers must be safe from injury on the transportation system. This includes traffic
control measures, intersection markings, and proper signage.

Educate the Public and Market the Availability of Alternative Modes
•

The benefits of alternative modes must be promoted to the public. Direct mail, traditional
advertising, schools, and employers can distribute information on transit and
bicycle/pedestrian facilities to the public. The more knowledge the public has about their
options, the more interested they will be in using alternative modes of transportation.

Quantification Methods:
Stand‐alone analyses were conducted for Land Use Planning Processes and Increasing Choices
in Modes of Transportation as described in the quantification methods below. The results were
then combined to reflect the strong interaction between these two measures and the support
and facilitation they provide to each other. In order to avoid double‐counting of GHG
reductions, the tonne reduction by transit as a stand alone measure, which were only 13 percent
as large as the land use reductions, were assumed to double‐count mode shifts to transit already
incorporated in the land use effectiveness rates.

A. Factoring GHG Emissions into Transportation and Land Use (TLU) Planning
Processes
This analysis considers potential GHG reductions from fewer personal (noncommercial) VMT
as a result of a shift toward more compact development patterns. The analysis relies on
estimates of per capita VMT by Census tract population density range, as developed by Polzin,
et al., for the CUTR VMT forecasting model. The CUTR model is based on analysis of 2001
Nationwide Household Travel Survey data. The model provides estimates of per capita VMT by
state for five density ranges. The model is currently set up for years 2005, 2035, and 2055; for
this analysis, results were interpolated for CCS analysis years.
The observed relationship between per capita VMT and population density is a rough proxy for
the effects of Smart Growth development as described above. Higher levels of population
density are associated with overall shorter trips because destinations are closer together. In
addition, areas with higher population densities are more likely to have pedestrian‐friendly
design (for example, walkability and mixed‐use development) and to support transit service. It
is difficult to separate the individual effects of the various Smart Growth strategies at this
aggregate level of analysis, but the analysis should provide an indicator of what can be
achieved through a combined set of Smart Growth policies.
The specific method used to estimate GHG benefits of Smart Growth strategies is as follows:

•

Total population in 2000 is identified by five Census tract density ranges as identified in the
CUTR model (<500, 500–1,999, 2000–3,999, 4,000–9,999, and 10,000 or more persons per
square mile).

•

The change in population from 1990 to 2000, and associated share of change by density
range, is identified from Census data.

•

For the Baseline scenario, new population growth between 2000 and 2020 (as determined
from CCS baseline assumptions) is allocated to tract density ranges based on the share of
growth in the 1990–2000 timeframe.

•

The proportion of existing housing stock (population) that would be redeveloped over this
time frame is estimated at 15 percent, of which two‐thirds is redeveloped in place and one‐
third is redeveloped elsewhere, with this redevelopment allocated to tract density ranges
based on the 1990–2000 share of population growth. (The 15 percent and two‐thirds figures

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
come from the 2007 Growing Cooler report Section 1.7.3, citing analysis of Census data by
Nelson [2006]).

•

For the Climate Action scenario, a significant shift in the proportion of new development
and relocated redevelopment is assumed to take place; with higher‐density tracts (> 4,000
persons per square mile) receiving over 75 percent of new development under this scenario
compared with only 55 percent under the Baseline scenario. Total population by tract
density under this scenario is then calculated. The net effect is a per‐capita reduction in
VMT of 11 percent for the average new resident under the Climate Action scenario,
compared to the BAU scenario.

•

Total personal‐travel VMT is calculated under the Baseline and Climate Action scenarios,
based on VMT per capita (from the CUTR model) and total 2025 population by tract density
range and the percent reduction in personal‐travel VMT is calculated.

The percent reduction in VMT is adjusted by 90 percent to estimate the percent reduction in
GHG emissions. This factor is the same as that used in the Growing Cooler report to account for
the fact that higher‐density areas may experience somewhat lower travel speeds and therefore
slightly reduced fuel economy.

B. Increasing Choices in Modes of Transportation
This analysis examines the reductions in GHGs possible by shifting from personal motor
vehicles to transit, which emits fewer GHGs per passenger‐mile. The calculation of GHG
reductions must account for the reduction in the number of private VMT and also account for
the partially offsetting increase in transit VMT. In addition to these direct reductions from
individuals’ shift of modes, two more long‐term, indirect effects are estimated: (1) the shifting of
trips from personal vehicles to transit can reduce the number of vehicles on the road, and thus
the amount of congestion in urban areas, and (2) reducing congestion improves traffic flow and
can improve actual average vehicle fuel economy. Studies have also demonstrated that
increased transit service can help shape land‐use patterns, enabling densities and proximity to
the center of urban areas. This has been shown to result in reduced VMT by those living in
transit corridors, even if they never use transit.
Direct quantification was undertaken for improvements in service frequency, reductions in
travel time, and the introduction of new and expansion of existing routes and services for bus,
BRT, commuter rail, and vanpools.
Travel time improvements provide a well‐documented means of improving transit service and
ridership. There is a direct benefit to riders because the improved service reduces the
“generalized cost” (time cost plus financial cost) of their trip. In addition to co‐benefits in
improving service frequency, there is about a –0.4 elasticity for transit travel time.
Service frequency increases ridership by existing riders and attracts new riders. As waiting time
between vehicles has been shown to be valued about two times more strongly on average than
actual travel time, this mechanism can prove very effective. There is a reported 0.5 elasticity for
service frequency alone (time between buses), while the aggregate impacts for service
C‐45
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
improvements in time between vehicles and travel time have shown an elasticity of between 0.6
and 1.0, incorporating the time and frequency impacts of aggregate increases in service miles
provided. The aggregate elasticity, using a value of 0.9, was applied to the total increase in
vehicle revenue service miles to capture both factors together.
For service expansions and introduction, both the literature and a first‐order statistical analysis
show a long run elasticity for service expansion of between 0.6 and 1.0. An elasticity of 0.9 was
applied to service increases.

Key Assumptions:
Fraction of new population growth and redevelopment by Census tract density, under Baseline
scenario.
Assumed shift in the fraction of new population growth and redevelopment from lower‐density
to higher‐density Census tracts, under Climate Action vs. Baseline scenario.
Percent of residential building stock redeveloped (off‐site) over the analysis time frame.
Transit ridership is analyzed as a scenario doubling ridership by 2025.
New or improved services will be able to attract ridership in a manner consistent with service
improvements in other similar areas of the country (if the Florida transit market is not at
saturation). Current fuel price increases provide a strong argument for this assumption.

Key Uncertainties
Smart Growth scenario analysis depends upon patterns of development that involve decisions
of many individual property owners and private capital investors. As result, the scenarios show
what is possible under a development scenario but should not be considered as predicted
outcomes.
The estimates developed using this methodology are consistent with results found in meta‐
analysis in the published literature, such as the recent Growing Cooler report from the Urban
Land Institute (ULI).
The availability of funding for the provision of additional transit service is speculative.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Smart Growth generally has very low direct costs to implement; the costs consist of
governmental costs of altering regulations and zoning and costs providing education and
technical assistance. Tax incentives are an income transfer that results in a public sector cost but
offsets developer revenue. As most Smart Growth policies (for example, allowing higher
density and mixed use, reducing parking requirements) are deregulatory in nature, they are
opening the development market and have significant indirect benefits. An exception is growth
boundaries, which restrict the land market use and have an indirect cost.
Alternative patterns of development have a large number of additional impacts, which may
provide both benefits and costs. Smart Growth provides a range of co‐benefits that are well
C‐46
Appendix C

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
documented in other places. Prominent among these is the reduced cost of providing utilities
and infrastructure, because Smart Growth makes better use of existing facilities and
infrastructure and, on average, has lower demand. Improved air quality, public health (due to
walking), and quality of life are also notable benefits.
Transit services have a large number of additional impacts which provide additional benefits.
Transit service provides mobility, accessibility, and safety benefits that are not included in the
analysis above. Other important benefits include improved air quality, public health (due to
walking), and quality of life. Transit benefits in reducing congestion and facilitating land use
patterns such as transit‐oriented development and Smart Growth are very significant and as
noted are partially reflected in the analysis above.

Feasibility Issues
Smart growth policies are being considered and implemented around the country in a wide
range of communities. Because most policies are deregulatory in nature, this significantly
lowers political barriers.

TLU-7. Incentive Programs for Increased Vehicle Fleet Efficiency

Policy Description
Florida can reduce its GHG emissions by improving the fuel economy of the LDV fleet. The first
policy step would be to charge a state agency with tracking the fuel economy of the state’s
entire fleet. Once a baseline for Florida’s fuel economy is established, the state could then
establish goals for improving the fleet’s fuel economy.
Policy recommendations for meeting a goal of higher fuel economy include consumer education
about vehicle purchases, monetary incentives through a feebate system or tax credits,
investment in a plug‐in hybrid infrastructure, and a state policy for scrapping older vehicles
that do not have good fuel economy. Information about vehicle fuel economy and benefits to
consumers from higher fuel economy are available at www.fueleconomy.gov. For example, as
the federal agencies responsible for that Web site explain, “The difference between a car that
gets 20 mpg and one that gets 30 mpg amounts to $775 per year (assuming 15,000 miles of
driving annually and a fuel cost of $3.10/per gallon).”
This recommendation includes several policies and programs to encourage the purchase of low‐
GHG‐emission vehicles through monetary and convenience rewards and incentives throughout
the state:

•

Procurement of efficient fleet vehicles.

•

Tax credits for efficient vehicles.

•

Incentive programs for major corporate fleet owners, including rental car and taxi
companies.

•

CO2‐based registration fees and vehicle licensing fees.

•

Procurement of efficient fleet vehicles (public, private, or other).

•

Feebates—This is a study option rather than an implementation recommendation. The state
would participate in a multistate study of the feasibility and effectiveness of a regional
feebate system with other eastern states.

•

Tax Credits for Low‐GHG Vehicles—Amend the current income tax credit program for hybrid,
alternative fuel, and low‐emission vehicles so that it continues in its present form beyond
2010.

•

Operating Incentives for Low‐GHG Vehicles—Provide for preferential state‐controlled (for
example, state highways) and local‐government controlled (for example, parking)
infrastructure and access for alternative‐fuel vehicles (E10, E85, natural gas, propane, 100
percent electric, and others).

C‐48
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Excise Taxes—Change new vehicle excise taxes so that they increase taxes for relatively high‐
emitting vehicles and reduce taxes for relatively low‐emitting vehicles. Overall, excise tax
revenue would remain the same.

•

Labeling—Promote a consumer labeling program that provides buyers with better
information on the GHG emissions of new vehicles.

Policy Design
This policy would have the effect of improving the average fuel economy of all new light‐duty
gasoline and diesel vehicles (including light‐duty trucks) in a given model year by two percent
on average. This improvement would be phased in linearly over a five‐year time frame starting
with Model Year 2011 and reaching the full targeted two percent for Model Year 2015 vehicles.
For example, the average fuel economy of Model Year 2011 light‐duty vehicles (LDVs) is
assumed to improve by 0.40 percent, Model Year 2012 vehicles by 0.80 percent, and so on until
the maximum two percent improvement is attained for Model Year 2015 and later vehicles.
Parties Involved: Florida DEP, consumer organizations, Florida Automobile Dealers
Association.

Implementation Mechanisms
The proposed policies and programs in this recommendation will need to be passed through
the legislative process and be implemented by state and local government agencies in
partnership with affected parties.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
While feebates are set as a new proposal, they are not completely unlike the application of
existing taxes such as vehicle sales tax and gas guzzler tax. The difference is the method of
calculation. In the case of feebates, the calculation will be on a vehicle’s “green rating” and can
adopt the GHG scores for vehicles as determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(US EPA) (http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicle/).
Some European countries have implemented feebate programs, and some U.S. states are
considering both the rebate portion and the gas guzzler tax elements of feebate‐type programs.
Canada introduced the Vehicle Efficiency Incentive (VEI) program, which took effect in March
2007. The program includes both rebate and tax components.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
It was assumed that this policy would have the effect of improving the average fuel economy of
all new light‐duty gasoline and diesel vehicles (including light‐duty trucks) in a given model
year by two percent on average. It was assumed that this improvement would be phased in
linearly over a 5‐year time frame starting with Model Year 2011 and reaching the full targeted
two percent for Model Year 2015 vehicles. For example, the average fuel economy of Model

Data Sources:
CCS conducted a review of the most relevant research and analysis on feebate proposals with
these findings:

•

There has been significant conceptual development of the feebate idea, especially at the
national level;

•

There is a need for a greater understanding of potential benefits and costs of state‐level and
multistate coordinated feebate programs; and

•

There has not been sufficient pilot testing of feebate programs in the United States to
provide implementation experience.

CCS assessed recent studies of potential GHG emission reductions from a national feebate
program based on modeling work conducted by the US DOE’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory
(ORNL). CCS also reviewed other relevant recent studies and analyses of feebates conducted by
the Canadian government, the State of California, and public interest research groups (PIRGs).
The ORNL and other studies assume a national feebate rate high enough to produce responses
from both consumers and manufacturers. ORNL’s estimate of the national potential for
reduction in CO2 emissions is approximately 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MMtCO2e) in 2010 and 66 MMtCO2e in 2020.
Some attempts have recently been made to estimate the GHG emissions reduction potential
from individual state feebate programs, such as those proposed for Arizona and California. For
example, a recent PIRG analysis suggests that a single state feebate program for Arizona would
result in an estimated reduction of 0.1 MMtCO2e GHG emissions in 2020.

______________________________________________________________________________
These recent estimates of the potential impacts of individual state programs are contingent on
assumptions and analytical methods that have not undergone thorough peer review. Therefore,
the results of these analyses are preliminary and should be interpreted with some caution.
Further analysis and study of the potential benefits and costs of individual state and multistate
feebate programs would greatly increase confidence in projected results.

Quantification Methods:
In order to quantify the GHG reductions and fuel savings which would result from
implementation of TLU‐7 for the state of Florida, CCS used the Vehicle Energy and Greenhouse
Gas Assessment Tool (VEGA Tool). The VEGA Tool was developed by the CCS team to
support its role in the Florida State Climate Action Plan process, to conduct analysis of various
policies affecting GHG emissions from the on‐road transportation sector.
Figure C‐7‐1 illustrates schematically how the VEGA Tool operates. The grey boxes represent
the inputs required: state GHG Inventory and Forecast data, existing actions, recent actions, and
the policy recommendations to be analyzed.

The tool helps the analyst quantify the existing actions, recent actions, and policy
recommendations by translating them into three aspects of on‐road transport that affect on‐road
vehicle emissions of greenhouse gases:
1. Fleet Characteristics: Types of vehicles being driven
o

Fuel Economy: The average miles per gallon for each model year and vehicle class

C‐51
Appendix C

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
o

Vehicle Class Distribution: The portion of the vehicle fleet falling into each of the 28
vehicle classes defined by the Mobile6 model (light‐duty gas vehicles, light‐duty gas
trucks – type 1, …)

o

Fleet Turnover Rate: The rate at which new cars are introduced and older cars are
retired from the vehicle fleet

2. Fuel Characteristics: Types of fuel these vehicles use
o

Fuels Used

o

Emission Rates of Fuels: Greenhouse gas emitted per unit of fuel

3. Travel Habits (VMT): How much are the vehicles being driven?
The above parameters, also illustrated in Figure C‐7‐2, can be adjusted by the analyst to best
reflect a given action or policy recommendation. The VEGA Tool then combines these
parameters to estimate what the greenhouse gas emissions would be should the policy
recommendation be implemented.
Policy TLU‐7 affected the fuel economy parameter. It was assumed that this improvement
would be phased in linearly over a 5‐year time frame starting with Model Year 2011 and
reaching the full targeted two percent for Model Year 2015 vehicles. Specifically, the average
fuel economy of Model Year 2011 light‐duty vehicles was assumed to improve by 0.40 percent,
Model Year 2012 vehicles by 0.80 percent, and so on until the maximum two percent
improvement was attained for Model Year 2015 and later vehicles. Fuel economy
improvements were calculated for each vehicle class and model year affected by the policy. It
was assumed that the policy would affect all light‐duty vehicles and trucks.
Once all of the parameters have been defined, the tool uses the following general methodology
to estimate fuel savings and GHG reductions. The vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and fuel
economy (mpg) are combined to estimate fuel consumption (gallons). The difference between
fuel consumption under baseline and policy recommendation conditions is the estimated
change in fuel consumption which would result from implementation of the policy
recommendation. The estimated change in fuel consumption is translated into an estimated
change in greenhouse gas emissions.
For this analysis, the baseline fuel consumption assumed that the new Federal CAFE standards
were in effect.

TLU-8. Increase Freight Movement Efficiencies

Policy Description
Currently in the United States, nearly 70 percent of all freight (by weight) is delivered by truck.
Existing infrastructure makes it unlikely that this distribution will be significantly changed at
any point in the near future, but the State of Florida can make significant strides in improving
the efficiency and environmental impact of the necessary freight movements within its
boundaries and current infrastructure. The expansion of the Panama Canal will dramatically
increase the number and frequency of goods passing through Florida’s 14 deep‐water ports in
the next decade, increasing the need for an established, efficient freight transportation system
within the State of Florida.
There has been tremendous growth in freight traffic, and national freight forecasts estimate an
89 percent increase in tons of freight by 2035 (“Transportation Invest in our Future—America’s
Freight Challenge,” American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials
[AASHTO], May 2007).To meet this increased demand while minimizing GHG emissions will
require many simultaneous actions in both the trucking and rail industries.
Within the trucking industry, market forces are creating new technology aimed at cutting the
GHG emissions of large trucks spurred in part by widespread anti‐idling laws and the price of
diesel fuel), particularly in conjunction with the US EPA’s SmartWay®. This program provides
a wide array of fuel‐saving techniques and actions for truck and rail companies as well as
measures for states to adopt. According to the American Trucking Association, Inc. (ATA), a
new 2008 truck produces one‐tenth the fine particulate emissions and about one‐half the smog‐
forming nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions as a similar truck manufactured just two years ago.
The ATA estimates that through a variety of measures, the trucking industry nationally could
save 86.1 billion gallons of diesel fuel and reduce the carbon output of the industry by 904.7
MMtCO2 over a 10‐year period while maintaining the level of freight movement the country
relies on.
The trucking industry has the ability to reduce its carbon footprint and GHG emissions in a
very short period of time through measures such as installing auxiliary power units, using
wide‐base tires, and limiting the speed trucks can travel, thereby lowering fuel consumption
and emissions.
There is a need for increased public support for these measures, because about 97 percent of
motor carriers have fewer than 20 trucks, and many smaller trucking companies are simply
unable to afford the upgrades and add‐ons that would make a significant impact on their fuel
efficiency and consumption.
From an energy consumption and GHG emission perspective, the use of intermodal
transportation to haul freight can be more efficient than moving that same freight by a single
mode of transport, depending on the distance, weight, and time sensitivity of the shipment.

______________________________________________________________________________
Domestic rail intermodal traffic grew—for the first time in three years—by 5.4 percent during
the second quarter of 2008. In response, rail companies have been investing in increased
capacity at record levels with major intermodal capacity expansions in the South that will
increase and improve rail intermodal service for Florida. This investment includes major
expansions by both CSX Corporation (CSX)and Norfolk Southern (NS) railroad companies into
Florida on high‐volume intermodal corridors from the Midwest and also includes a current
project to nearly double the capacity on the major intermodal corridor between Jacksonville and
Miami.
This policy recommendation should focus on reducing the trucking industry’s carbon footprint
and GHG emissions, while maintaining the current level of service to the state and nation, and
encouraging the development and expansion of intermodal and long‐distance rail capacity to
support both local and transcontinental rail service into and out of Florida. The U.S.
Department of Transportation’s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) lists two major
categories of emissions‐reducing strategies that Florida can utilize in these goals:

•

Technical strategies, which modify a piece of equipment or its fuel to reduce emissions; and

•

Operational strategies, which change the way a piece of equipment is used, resulting in
lower emissions.

Policy Design
Goals: Reduce overall GHG emissions generated by freight movement through combinations of
the following technical and operational strategies:

Technical Strategies
•

Reduce road freight bottlenecks in known urbanized, congested areas and assess the
feasibility and costs associated with increased and appropriately sited inland port
development in Florida.

•

By 2010, FDOT and its partners will assess the feasibility and costs associated with inland
port development in Florida.

•

Support the reduction of emissions by railroads through increased deployment of
innovative US EPA–approved reduced carbon emissions from hybrid and genset
locomotives.

•

Support incentives for shippers to use rail for freight movements.

•

Encourage increased participation in the SmartWay® program for both truck and rail
industries.

•

Assess the level of advancements in global positioning system (GPS) and other technologies
for all modes of freight movement.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Provide tax incentives, grant programs, or other reliable funding sources to trucking
companies to encourage:
○

The purchase and installation of devices that eliminate the need to idle, including
battery‐electric auxiliary power systems, vehicle battery systems, thermal energy storage
systems, and fueled auxiliary power systems. In addition, provide an exemption for the
additional weight caused by the installation of these units with respect to highway
weigh stations.

○

Investment in hybrid truck and alternative fuel technologies as they become available in
class 7 and class 8 trucks over the next 3 years and beyond.

•

Assess the possibility of changes in truck weight and configuration restrictions to maximize
trip efficiency.

•

Purchase and use wide‐base tires, which reduce drag and thereby increase fuel efficiency.

•

Consider supporting a national reduced speed limit and/or national fuel economy standards
for trucks.

•

By 2015, FDOT will develop a plan to convert all weigh stations in Florida to weigh‐in‐
motion stations and will continue to pursue new technologies that improve efficiency at
weigh stations and truck stops, including truck stop electrification.

•

Purchase and install equipment so that trucks can utilize the technologies at electrified truck
stops.

•

Continue development of idling reduction standards for all heavy‐duty diesel engines,
pursuant to Governor Crist’s Executive Order 07‐127.

•

Promote other GHG‐emissions‐reducing technologies as they are developed.

Operational Strategies
•

Through the FDOT Strategic Intermodal System (SIS) Plan, the Florida Rail System Plan,
and continued participation in multi‐partnered coalitions among states, railroads, and
freight industries—exemplified by the I‐95 Corridor Coalition—the State of Florida will
continue its efforts to identify and remove physical and operational freight‐related
bottlenecks for efficient movement of freight by all modes of transportation.

•

By 2015, FDOT and its partners will develop a plan to seek additional funding for
implementing improvements that will remove identified freight bottlenecks, including
funding improvements to SIS connector routes.

•

Reconvene the Freight Stakeholders Task Force to identify actions that support the efficient
movement of freight and identify opportunities for intermodal freight movement.

•

To encourage railroad capital investment and to increase capacity and efficiency, FDOT will
continue to support and expand initiatives such as

American Trucking Association’s “Sustainability Task Force: Strategies for Further Reduction of the
Trucking Industry’s Carbon Footprint (October 2007).

Quantification Methods:
Estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions from reduced idling by (1) estimating the portion of
emissions and fuel consumption in the Florida inventory that is attributable to Class 8 diesel
trucks traveling on long‐haul trips, (2) estimating the portion of total fuel consumption that
would be consumed during idling, and (3) applying a targeted reduction of 80 percent to this
amount starting in 2008 and a reduction of 90 percent starting in 2015.
Estimate the mode shift potential from long‐haul trucking to intermodal rail by estimating the
amount of heavy‐duty truck traffic on long‐haul trips, the commodity mix share that is
amenable to an intermodal shift, the investment costs necessary to upgrade intermodal
terminals and rail bottlenecks, and the expected mode shift that is likely based on logistics cost
cross‐price elasticities.

Key Assumptions:
This analysis assumes that idle reductions are achieved only by Class 8 diesel trucks, these
trucks idle for an average of six hours per day, they consume 0.8 to 1.2 gallons of diesel fuel per
hour during idling, and that an 80 percent (by 2010) or 100 percent (by 2020) reduction of diesel
idling from these Class 8 trucks will be achieved. The cost analysis will assume a 5‐year lifetime
for idling technology equipment, applied to 80 percent of Class 8 vehicles starting in 2008 and

Memo‐Draft
To:

Florida Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Technical Working Group

From:

The Center for Climate Strategies

Subject:

Assumptions for AFW Mitigation Policy Options Quantification

Date:

July 22, 2008

This memo summarizes key assumptions used to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts
and cost effectiveness for draft Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste (AFW) policy options. The
quantification process is intended to support custom design and analysis of draft policy
options, and provide both consistency and flexibility. The purpose of this memo is to present
the assumptions used as part of the quantification process in order to ensure consistency
between options and between subcommittees. Feedback on the assumptions is encouraged.
Quantifying reductions of GHG (particularly future reductions) is an inherently complex
process and assumptions are important inputs into the quantification methodologies and
models used to estimate policy costs and benefits. Models are representations of reality, and
require the best available data on likely futures. An emphasis should be placed on using
assumptions that are based on the best available data using local or regional data (when
available) rather than national level data.
Unless directed otherwise by the Florida Action Team, the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS)
will estimate the lifecycle GHG reductions for each policy option, where data and methods are
available to do so. In the Florida GHG Inventory and Forecast (I&F), the only sector for which
consumption‐based emissions data are provided is the electricity consumption sector. In all
other sectors of the inventory, the GHG emissions are strictly those that occur within the state as
a result of energy consumption or other GHG emission process (for example, methane from
landfilled waste). For example, for fuel combustion in the RCI and Transportation sectors, only
the emissions associated with fuel combustion are provided, not those associated with the
extraction, transport, processing, and distribution of each fuel. Similarly, for waste
management, only emissions associated with waste management processes in Florida are
included in the I&F (for example, landfilling or waste combustion), not those associated with
production and transportation of the initial packaging or product that became a component of
the solid waste stream.

______________________________________________________________________________
Development of consumption‐based emission estimates (including embedded GHG from
lifecycle assessments) for all sectors of the inventory are beyond the scope of this process.
Indeed, in many cases, these types of inventory estimates would involve significant technical
and data availability challenges. However, for some policy options, lifecycle emission
reductions can be estimated, and it should be recognized that the portion of emission reductions
that occur out of state as a result of in‐state policies are not captured in the I&F. Some might see
these methodological differences in emissions and emission reductions accounting as a
disconnect; however, CCS believes that the Action Team should consider taking credit for
reductions that occur out of state as a result of actions taken within the state of Florida. Some
common examples of where this accounting occurs are:
•

•

•

Fossil fuel consumption: inventory estimates are based only on the GHG emissions
associated with the combustion of each fuel; lifecycle emission reductions are estimated
using GHGs from combustion plus the embedded GHGs from extraction,
transportation, processing, and distribution;
Solid waste management: landfill methane emissions or total GHG emissions are
associated only with waste combustion and decomposition; lifecycle emission
reductions include the landfill/waste combustion emissions plus those associated with
production of the packaging or product (for example, net difference of use of virgin
materials versus recycled materials);
Biofuels consumption: for fossil fuel displacement benefits, the inventory includes only
GHGs from fossil fuel combustion; lifecycle emission reductions are estimated using the
lifecycle gasoline/diesel emission factors compared to lifecycle biofuel emission factors
(captures total GHGs from fuel production, processing, and distribution).

Biomass Supply
The table below indicates the biomass availability in Florida. The source/reference for the value
is indicated in the notes section. The AFW Subcommittee will work to refine this initial
assessment during the process. [Note: this table has been updated in the material that follows

The assumed emissions factor for nitrogen applied is 4.76 kg CO2e / kg N applied (on‐farm).
This is obtained from the inventory and forecast. The avoided life cycle GHG emissions
(emissions associated with the production, transport, and energy consumption during
application) were taken from Wood and Cowie3. The estimate provided for the U.S. (taken from
West and Marland, 20014) was 858 grams (g) CO2e per kilogram of nitrogen (kgN)5. This
provides a total emissions factor of 5.61 kg CO2e / kg N applied.

Capital costs and capacity factors
Estimates of capital costs and capacity factors for new generating capacity vary tremendously.
The following table from the Annual Energy Outlook 2007 shows the capital cost and operation
and maintenance (O&M) costs used by the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) model.

Source: Assumptions to the AEO 2007, p. 77.8

Renewable Incentives
Inclusion of the federal production tax credit (PTC) in the levelized cost estimates for
renewables in the Policy Options needs to be considered. The federal Renewable Electricity
Production Tax Credit has been around in some form since 1992 but seems to always be about
to expire (currently December 2008). The existing incentive for wind, closed‐loop biomass, and
geothermal is 2.0¢/kWh. Electricity from open‐loop biomass, small irrigation hydroelectric,
landfill gas, municipal solid waste resources receives a 1.0¢/kWh credit.

Fuel Life‐Cycle Emission Factors

for the year 2010 and utilize the model’s default assumptions except where noted
(downloadable from http://www.transportation.anl.gov/software/GREET/). The factors assume
an average fuel economy of 100 miles/4.3 gallons (23.2 mpg) for gasoline‐powered vehicles and
100 miles/3.6 gallons (27.8 mpg) for diesel‐powered engines, based on the 2005 model year
average. The life‐cycle emission factor for gasoline is 11.3 metric tons CO2e/1,000 gallons. This
number assumes a mix of 50 percent conventional gasoline and 50 percent reformulated
gasoline. The life‐cycle emission factor for low‐sulfur diesel is 11.3 metric tons CO2e/1,000
gallons.
The life‐cycle emission factor for 100 percent corn ethanol is 9.1 metric tons CO2e/1,000 gallons.
This value includes 195 g CO2e /bushel emissions for land use change due to corn farming.
The life‐cycle emission factor for cellulosic ethanol is 1.51 metric tons CO2e/1,000 gallons. This
number assumes a mix of 25 percent herbaceous biomass, 25 percent forest residue, 25 percent
corn stover, and 25 percent woody biomass (from farmed trees).
The life‐cycle emission factor for soybean‐based biodiesel is 0.667 metric tons CO2e/1,000
gallons.
Carbon emissions from land use change
Recent publications such as Searchinger, et al., 2008 (Searchinger et al., Sciencexpress, “Use of
U.S. Croplands for Biofuels Increases Greenhouse Gases through Emissions from Land Use
Change,” February 7, 2008), have attempted to estimate the carbon emissions that result from
land use being converted to cropland to grow crops for fuel. This is based on the argument that
the conversion of current cropland from food/feed/fiber production in one part of the world will
drop the food/feed/fiber supply on the market and drive grassland or forest conversion to
cropland in other parts of the world. There is still significant uncertainty regarding the value of
carbon emissions due to land use change so at this juncture emissions from land use change are
not incorporated into the quantification except those already included in the GREET model.

______________________________________________________________________________
Overlap Discussion
The amount of GHG emissions reduced or carbon sequestered and the costs of a policy option
within the Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW) sector may overlap with some
of the quantified benefits and costs of policy options within other sectors.
Every effort will be made to determine where those overlaps occur and to eliminate double
counting. As displayed in the Summary List above, the AFW sector totals will be reduced
accordingly.
AFW‐4 calls for energy production from biomass. The Energy Supply and Demand (ESD)
Technical Working Group also quantified the use of biomass for energy production (for
example, ESD‐5 and ESD‐8). AFW‐4 has a higher demand for biomass than the combined ESD
options post 2010. To avoid double counting, the biomass demand requirements for ESD (in
MMBtu) were removed from the AFW sector totals as these were considered to be accounted for
under the ESD analyses. The costs associated with the use of those units of biomass were also
removed from the AFW sector totals (these were also assumed to be accounted for under the
ESD analyses).
AFW‐7 calls for the amount of biofuels produced in the state of Florida to increase. The
Transportation and Land Use (TLU) Technical Working Group also quantified the use of
biofuels to decrease the carbon content of fuels (in TLU‐1). AFW‐7 was quantified assuming
higher levels of cellulosic ethanol production and use than TLU‐1 in 2025. The GHG benefits
from gallons of biofuels consumed through TLU‐1 were subtracted from the calculation of
gallons produced in AFW‐7, so as to avoid double‐counting these reductions. The costs
associated with the production of these gallons were also removed from the AFW totals
(because these production costs are also assumed to be captured under the TLU‐1 cost
estimate).
Biomass Supply
Several options call for a supply of in‐state biomass. The supply and demand for state biomass
resources are assessed in Table D‐1 below to ensure there are sufficient resources to meet the
policy option goals.

in Florida, including almost 2.7 million acres of current agricultural lands and 2.7 million acres
of existing habitat. This growth will create enormous pressure to develop the landscape.
Developed areas contain lower amounts of biomass and its associated carbon. Developed areas
also sequester less CO2 than forested areas. Much of the carbon stored in forest biomass and
soils can be lost as a result of such land‐use conversion.
When landowners don’t have incentives to retain ownership, they often sell for development
and also sell forested tracts by smaller parcels, making effective forest management impractical.
Managed stands sequester carbon faster than non‐managed stands. Carbon is sequestered on a
long‐term basis in durable products.
This policy seeks to reduce the rate at which existing forests are cleared, fragmented, and
converted to developed uses, while also providing mechanisms that ensure healthy forest
management. There are a variety of public and private conservation programs that can be used
to halt this landscape conversion. This policy will emphasize the value of existing forest cover
and its importance as carbon stock.
Note that this policy overlaps with AFW‐2: Afforestation and Restoration of Non‐Forested Lands and
AFW‐3: Forest Management for Carbon Sequestration.

Other: Based on the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data, Florida lost 74.3 thousand
acres of forestland from 1995 to 2005 (from 16,221.2 down to 16,146.9 million acres), resulting in
a 0.5 percent reduction in forestland. During the same time period, the timberland (forestland
capable of producing merchantable timber) acreage increased by 901.2 thousand acres (from
14,650.7 to 15,551.9 million acres), which corresponds to a 6.2 percent increase over a 10‐year
period. However, that does not mean forestland conversion to development is not occurring in
Florida. It means that, for this period of time, acreage was planted with trees, offsetting almost
all of the forestland converted to other land uses throughout the state, and that some of the
acreage previously classified as forestland is now classified as timberland.

Implementation Mechanisms
Achieve “no net loss” or an increase in forest carbon stocks through local land‐use planning,
conservation easements, federal and state incentive programs available to family forest
landowners, outreach, favorable tax incentives and disincentives, and other relevant forest
retention mechanisms (for example, carbon trading).
Continue purchasing acres through the Florida Forever program.
Provide technical and material assistance to forest land owners to encourage them to keep forest
land in forest cover. This can be accomplished by maintaining and, whenever possible,
increasing ongoing forestry assistance programs. The following are current forest assistance
programs:

•

Forest Stewardship Program—Provides resource management plans and technical
guidance to encourage multiple‐use management of private lands. Multiple‐use includes
production of a variety of forest products, improved wildlife habitat, increased recreational
opportunities, improved aesthetics, and cleaner air and water. This program is partially
funded by federal dollars that are expected to continue to decline.

•

Conservation Reserve Program—Provides incentives to reduce soil erosion and protect
water quality by returning lower quality farm ground to forest cover. This program is
federally funded, with DOF foresters providing technical guidance on reforestation
practices.

•

Environmental Quality Incentive Program—Provides incentives to reduce soil erosion and
protect water quality through a wide variety of practices. This program is federally funded,
with DOF foresters providing technical guidance on reforestation and forest productivity
enhancement practices. The 2008 federal Farm Bill includes language to increase the
emphasis on forestry practices. Support is required to ensure that the forestry language
remains a priority and a new Farm Bill is passed.

•

Forest Land Enhancement Program—This program provided federal cost‐share dollars to
private landowners to improve current forest condition and provide assistance in
reforestation. These practices reduced threats from wildfire, insects, and disease while

increasing forest productivity. This program has expired and is not likely to receive federal
funding in the future.

•

Cooperative Forestry Assistance—County foresters are available to assist landowners in
forest management planning. County foresters provide technical guidance on how to
improve and protect forest health and productivity.

•

Forest Health, Southern Pine Beetle Program—The DOF offers technical and financial
assistance to landowners to reduce risks associated with insect and disease problems. This
program is partially funded with federal dollars.

•

Urban and Community Forests—Provides federal dollars to encourage cities to develop
tree planting and maintenance programs. Urban trees reduce heat buildup in cities and
reduce energy consumed for cooling by providing shade, cleaning air, producing oxygen,
improving aesthetics, and storing carbon. Blocks of trees near cities can serve many of the
above functions as well as provide recreational areas, storm water retention and filtration,
groundwater recharge, reduced water treatment costs, and increased water supply.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Florida has aggressively pursued the acquisition of conservation lands over the past 25 years,
preserving more than 2 million acres with more than $6 billion in funding for the Preservation
2000 program and its successor, the Florida Forever program.
The NRCS’s Farm Bill programs (Conservation Reserve Program [CRP], GRP, Wildlife Habitat
Incentives Program [WHIP], and Environmental Quality Incentives Program [EQIP]) provide
financial incentives to landowners to maintain forestlands.
The US FWS’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife program supports restoration and conservation of
high priority habitats by forming partnerships with private landowners.
Florida FWC’s Landowner Assistance Program provides habitat management
recommendations aimed at forming long‐term partnerships with private landowners that lead
to the restoration and conservation of high‐priority habitats identified in Florida’s Wildlife
Action Plan (http://myfwc.com/wildlifelegacy/). Recommendations include restoring native
groundcover and overstory species, planting new pine stands at low densities, and thinning
existing stands to benefit carbon sequestration, wildlife habitats, and forest health.
Florida Farm Bureau’s Carbon Trading Program is now in effect and offers financial incentives
to landowners for maintaining forestlands.
Florida’s proposed Amendment 4 would provide additional tax incentives to landowners who
retire development rights through a conservation easement.
In 2006, Florida had 16.7 million acres of forest land, of which nearly 16.0 million acres were
classified as timberland. The Florida Division of Forestry (DOF) manages 1.0 million acres of
D‐17
Appendix D

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
forest land in 34 state forests, and provides technical assistance to other state and local agencies
which manage an additional 1.9 million acres of forest land. Through various other programs
(see below) DOF provides technical assistance to individual and family landowners who control
nearly five million acres of Florida’s forest lands. Federal forest lands constitute 2.1 million
acres, forest industry owns 1.6 million acres, non‐industrial private forests in corporate
ownership constitute nearly five million acres, and other ownership equals 0.1 million acres of
forest lands in Florida.
Besides managing state forests, DOF is working with family and individual forest landowners,
who control five million acres (30 percent) of Florida’s forest lands, to advocate forest
management aimed at well stocked forests for the duration of a rotation from tree planting to
final harvest. Well stocked forests have a basal area of 60 to 80 square feet per acre. When
forests reach a merchantable basal area of approximately 100 to 150 square feet per acre, they
are thinned back to the 60 to 80 square feet range to sustain optimal tree growth and forest
health. After final harvest, pine forests should be replanted at a minimum of 605 or 726 trees per
acre to ensure adequate survival, tree growth, tree form, and subsequently timber quality and
quantity. Planting at the recommended densities provides an opportunity for thinning in the
middle of a 25‐ to 30‐year rotation, making wood available for energy production or traditional
forest products. More trees at planting and adequate forest stocking means more CO2
sequestered by rapidly growing young trees and more opportunities for woody biomass
harvest for energy production and other uses.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoided CO2 emissions in case of retained forests; and maintained carbon sequestration in
forests that are not cleared.
When forests are harvested and not replanted, most of the biomass is converted back to CO2. For
some long lived products it takes decades to revert back to CO2, but for other like paper and
packaging materials the “decaying” process can be measured in months or years. Therefore,
whenever the forest is retained “on the stump” CO2 emissions are avoided.

Data for rates of forest area change are from USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and
Analysis Unit, using publicly‐available information on forest area change between 1987 and
2003 inventories. These forest area estimates are also included in the Inventory and Forecast for
Florida (Appendix H). Data available online at: http://fia.fs.fed.us/tools‐data/default.asp.

Quantification Methods:
Carbon savings from this recommendation were estimated from two sources: (1) the amount of
carbon that would be lost as a result of forest conversion to developed uses (known as “avoided
emissions”) and (2) the amount of annual carbon sequestration potential that is maintained by
protecting the forest area.

1. Avoided Emissions
Carbon savings from avoided emissions were calculated using statewide average estimates of
total standing forest carbon stocks in Florida, provided by the USFS as part of the Forest
Inventory and Forecast for Florida (Appendix H).
Loss of forests to development results in a large one‐time surge of carbon emissions. In this
case, it was assumed that 100 percent of the vegetation carbon stocks would be lost in the event
of forest conversion to developed uses, with no appreciable carbon sequestration in soils or
biomass following conversion. While soil carbon may be lost on forest conversion to developed
use, soil carbon loss was excluded from this analysis because soil carbon dynamics are not
included in the baseline calculations for the Inventory and Forecast. A comparison of data from
the American Housing Survey with land use conversion data from the Natural Resources
Inventory (NRI) suggests that, on average, two thirds of the land area in residential lots is
cleared during land conversion. Thus, it was assumed that, during forest conversion to
developed use, 100 percent of the forest vegetation would be lost on 67 percent of the converted
acreage. Using the statewide average carbon densities from the Florida FIA results, roughly 13.7
metric tons of carbon (tC) emissions are avoided for every acre of forest not converted to
another use in Florida.
Between 1995 and 2005, roughly 7,420 acres of forest were lost annually in Florida (USDA Forest
Service Forest Inventory and Analysis, FL Inventory and Forecast (Appendix H)). To reach the
no‐net‐forest‐loss target by 2015, this recommendation therefore assumes that 7,420 acres must
be preserved each year beginning in 2015. The number of acres targeted for policy
implementation between 2009 and 2015 was calculated by dividing 7,420 by seven and
implementing the recommendation gradually and linearly over the seven‐year period between
2009 and 2015 (Table 1‐1).
Each year, the number of acres estimated to remain forested as a result of the program was
multiplied by 13.7 tC to estimate total avoided emissions due to forest preservation in that year.
Table 1‐1 shows the annual and total acres targeted by the program and associated avoided
emissions that would be generated between 2009 and 2025.

2. Annual Sequestration Potential in Protected Forests
The calculations in this section of the analysis used default carbon sequestration values for the
forest types most common in Florida. The default values apply to forests in the Southeast (USFS
GTR‐343, Tables A41, A43, A44, and A45; see data sources listed above). Average annual carbon
sequestration for these forest types was calculated over 45 years, assuming a typical forest age
distribution statewide. An average annual sequestration rate was calculated by subtracting non‐
soil carbon stocks in 45‐year‐old stands from non‐soil carbon stocks in new stands and dividing
by average stand age and are summarized in Table 1‐2. Soil carbon density was assumed
constant and is not included in the calculation.

In Florida, longleaf‐slash pine makes up about 35 percent of forested lands, oak‐gum‐cypress
makes up 18 percent, oak‐hickory comprises 17 percent, and oak‐pine and loblolly‐shortleaf
pine are each roughly 9 percent of forested land. All other forest types make up less than 4
percent each of the state’s forests (Florida Inventory and Forecast, Appendix H). The proportion
of Florida forests summarized in Table 1‐2 were rounded up to account for all other forest
types. This analysis assumes that forests will be protected in roughly equal proportion to their
occurrence statewide (Table 1‐2). Carbon sequestration in the average acre of protected Florida
forest was calculated at roughly 1.67 metric tons of carbon per hectare per year (0.67 tC/ha).
The results for annual sequestration potential under policy implementation are given in Table
1‐3. Forests preserved in one year continue to sequester carbon in subsequent years. Thus,
annual sequestration potential includes benefits from acres preserved cumulatively under the
program.

4. Economic analysis
Economic costs of protecting forestland were assumed to be equivalent to the one‐time cost of
land protection at $3,836/acre. This estimate was calculated by dividing the total investment in
the Florida Forever program (2001‐2008) by the cumulative acreage protected under that
program.14
Net economic costs of protecting forestland are presented in Table 1‐5. Discounted costs were
calculated using a five percent discount rate, with a total NPV of $186 million. The cost‐
effectiveness of this recommendation is $36/tCO2e avoided.

Key Assumptions: As outlined in text. The largest of these is the rate of forest conversion that
would occur through 2025 without this policy being implemented. The current assumption of
around 7,400 acres per year is based on the difference in state‐wide forested acres measured
between 1995 and 2005. Because some change in forested area during this period is likely due to
conversion of lands without forest cover (for example, agricultural lands) to forest cover, the
current assumption could significantly underestimate the amount of forest acres lost due to
development. On the other hand, the current poor economic situation has certainly affected the
rate of forest loss in the last year or two and could continue to affect conversion rates further
into the policy period.

Key Uncertainties
Due to a lack of information, the benefits of forest soil carbon saved through land protection are
not included in the analysis above, but are potentially significant. This should be a key area of
future related research in Florida.

AFW-2. Afforestation and Restoration of Non-Forested Lands

Policy Description
Establish forests on land that has not historically been forested (for example, agricultural land,
“afforestation”). Promote forest cover and associated carbon stocks by regenerating lands
previously forested (“reforestation”). In addition, implement practices (for example, soil
preparation, erosion control, and stand stocking) to ensure conditions that support forest
growth. Additional benefits include public recreation, water quality, wildlife habitat, and
enhanced biodiversity.
Maintain and improve the health and longevity of tree canopy cover in urban and residential
areas to protect and enhance the carbon stored in tree biomass, to absorb air pollution and
increase oxygen supplies, and to reduce heating and cooling needs as a result of increased
shading. Promote use of software programs that can be used by cities and communities to track
and assess the ecological and economic benefits of urban forestry.
Note that this policy has overlap with AFW‐1: Forest Retention—Reduced Conversion of Forested to
Non‐Forested Land Uses and AFW‐3 Forest Management for Carbon Sequestration.

Policy Design
Goals:
•

Forested Landscape (Afforestation)—Increase the area of forested lands in Florida by 50,000
acres annually between 2009 and 2025.

•

Forested Landscape (Reforestation) – Implement reforestation activity on all harvested acreage
from 2009 through 2025.

•

Urban Forestry (Primary Goal)—Plant and maintain enough trees in urban areas to offset 2008
metropolitan carbon emissions by 3 percent by 2025.

•

Urban Forestry (Secondary Goal)—Increase the tree canopy coverage in all developed areas
[with a population greater than 500 residents per square mile] to 30 percent by 2025.

Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Florida private forestland owners, DOF, Florida Forestry Association, FWC,
UF IFAS, NRCS, nongovernmental agencies, RPCs, other state land management agencies,

Other: For urban forestry, the two goals overlap in terms of GHG benefits. Each will be
quantified, and the goal with the largest benefit included in the summary table at the front of
this document.
Intensifying reforestation and afforestation efforts in Florida’s forests could increase the amount
of greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. According to 2006 data, approximately 152,000 acres are
reforested annually in Florida by deliberate efforts, and an additional 34,000 acres are reforested
annually by naturally occurring forest self‐regeneration. The total of 186,000 acres reforested
and afforested annually represents 1.2 percent of all forestlands in Florida. Artificial
reforestation (planting trees after final forest harvest) and afforestation (planting trees on
agricultural and other lands) should be performed to establish adequate tree densities. Pine
forests should be planted at a minimum of 605 or 726 trees per acre to assure adequate survival,
tree growth, tree form and subsequent timber quality and quantity. Rapidly growing young
pine trees sequester large quantities of CO2; stands that are not adequately stocked provide only
a fraction of potential GHG reduction and woody biomass production for renewable energy
production and other uses.

Implementation Mechanisms
Landowner assistance and/or incentive programs are needed to encourage reforestation and
afforestation in Florida.
Discourage clear‐cutting of forests when building housing developments. Protect a percentage
of native cover when developing land.
Tax exemptions or tax relief for land in conservation.
Change the acreage minimum that so small landowners can receive incentives for land
conservation as well as large landowners.
Establish a baseline for urban forest carbon storage and sequestration rates in Florida’s top 10
metropolitan areas (based on population). By quantifying carbon storage and sequestration
rates in these areas, it will be possible to establish appropriate long term goals to determine the
number of trees required to offset carbon emissions and reduce energy consumption in urban
areas. Currently in Tampa, the urban forest only offsets approximately one percent of carbon
emissions associated with human activity. A goal should be set for urban forests to offset carbon
emissions at the 2008 population levels by 10 percent by 2025.
Increased tree canopy coverage can be accomplished by a combination of tree planting projects,
delineating natural areas in new developments, preservation of suitable specimen and groups
of specimen trees on parcels during development, and adequate care of existing trees in
developed areas.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Farm Bill programs [Conservation Reserve
Program (CRP), Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), Wildlife Habitats Incentive Program
(WHIP), and Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP)] support reforestation.
The U.S. FWS’s Partners for Fish and Wildlife supports reforestation of high‐priority habitats.
The Florida FWC’s Landowner Assistance Program provides habitat management
recommendations aimed at forming long‐term partnerships with private landowners that lead
to the restoration and conservation of high priority habitats, identified in Florida’s Wildlife
Action Plan http://myfwc.com/wildlifelegacy/. Recommendations include restoring native
groundcover, overstory species, planting new pine stands at low densities, and thinning
existing stands to benefit carbon sequestration, wildlife habitats, and forest health.
The Urban and Community Forestry Program in DACS helps promote urban forestry and
provides grants. City Green and I‐Tree are programs that cities and communities can use to
measure urban trees.
DOF is working with family and individual forest landowners, who control 5 million acres (61
percent) of Florida’s forest lands, to advocate forest management aimed at well stocked forests
for the duration of a rotation from tree planting to final harvest. Well stocked forests have a
basal area of 60 to 80 square feet per acre. When forests reach a merchantable basal area of
approximately 100 to 150 square feet per acre, they are thinned back to the 60 to 80 square feet
range to sustain optimal tree growth and forest health. After final harvest, pine forests should
be replanted at a minimum of 605 or 726 trees per acre to ensure adequate survival, tree growth,
tree form, and subsequently timber quality and quantity. Planting at the recommended
densities provides an opportunity for thinning in the middle of a 25‐ to 30‐year rotation making
wood available for energy production or traditional forest products. More trees at planting and
adequate forest stocking means more CO2 sequestered by rapidly growing young trees and
more opportunities for woody biomass harvest for energy production and other uses.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Forested Landscape: Additional sequestered CO2 in above‐ and belowground biomass by
growing trees on afforested/reforested acres that would not have been planted or self‐
regenerated under BAU conditions.
Urban Forestry: Additional sequestered CO2 in planted trees; indirect savings of CO2, CH4, and
N2O as a result of energy savings achieved where trees are planted to achieve shading and
windbreak benefits.

Quantification Methods:
A. Forested Landscape
This component of the policy recommendation seeks to increase the area of land in forest cover
using two mechanisms: first, adding acreage to the land area currently in forested use
(afforestation) and second, replanting forest land following harvest (reforestation).

1. Afforestation
This policy recommendation seeks to increase the area of land in forest cover by 50,000 acres
annually between 2009 and 2025. Forests grown or planted on land not currently in forest cover
will most likely accumulate carbon at a rate consistent with the accumulation rates of average
forests in the region. Therefore, carbon sequestered by afforestation activities can be assumed to
occur at the same rate as carbon sequestration in average Florida forests.
A weighted‐average annual rate of carbon sequestration for young‐aged forests in Florida was
calculated as 0.997 tC/acre/year, using data on carbon stocks by age class published by USFS for
the five most dominant forest groups, which together total nearly 93 percent of forestland in
Florida (Table 2‐1; Smith et al citation noted above). For each forest type group, annual carbon
sequestration rates were calculated by subtracting carbon stocks in new stands (0 years‐old)
from carbon stocks in 15‐year‐old stands and dividing by 15 years. An average rate was
calculated, weighted by area of each forest type to take into account variation in carbon
sequestration across forest types. A 15‐year rate was used to reflect the average age of forested
stands during the timeframe of analysis. Young stands typically sequester carbon at faster rates
than older stands.

While AFW‐1 seeks to reverse the current decreasing trend in Florida’s existing forests, the
afforestation component of AFW‐2 aims to increase forested acreage each year by creating new
forest cover in areas that would have otherwise remained under non‐forest cover. Thus all of
the planted acreage represents a net addition to the forested land base. The goal level of an
additional 50,000 acres per year requires that 850,000 additional acres of forest be planted over
the 17‐year policy implementation period. This would increase forestland area by roughly 5.5
percent over the 2005 forest area estimate.
A forest continues to accumulate carbon each year after it is planted. Thus, to calculate the
carbon sequestration attributed to this policy, the weighted‐average annual carbon
sequestration rate was multiplied by the cumulative acres of additional forestland planted each
year since 2009. Forested acres (annual and cumulative) and annual total carbon sequestration

The cost of $275/acre is estimated based on estimates from the DOF.15 In reality costs will vary,
depending on specific goals of the tree‐planting project, species planted, and site conditions.
Potential future cost savings from forest products (for example, merchantable timber or
bioenergy feedstocks) are not taken into account. These cost savings would most likely not be
realized during the time frame of this analysis.
Annual costs of afforestation activity were calculated by multiplying the number of acres
planted each year by $275/acre (Table 2‐2). Annual costs were discounted using a five percent
rate to convert future dollars to present values. The sum of annual discounted costs from 2009
to 2025 yields an estimate of the a cumulative cost (NPV) of this policy, which is on the order of
$134 million. The cost‐effectiveness is calculated by dividing the NPV by the cumulative GHG

2. Reforestation
The reforestation component of AFW‐2 seeks to encourage regeneration on acreage that is
harvested. In Florida, between 1995 and 2005, 336.2 thousand acres were harvested annually
while only 188.3 thousand acres experienced natural or artificial regeneration (Table 2‐3).16 The
acreage available for reforestation under AFW‐2 is thus the acreage that is harvested but not
regenerated, totaling 147.9 thousand acres annually (Table 2‐3). It was assumed that this acreage
would be reforested each year, from 2009 through 2025, resulting in a total of 2.5 million acres
reforested over and above BAU by 2025.

It was assumed that carbon sequestered by reforestation occurs at the same rate as carbon
sequestration in average Florida forests. A weighted‐average annual rate of carbon
sequestration for young reforested stands in Florida was calculated as 1.25 tC/ha/year (0.51
tC/acre/year), using data on carbon stocks by age class published by USFS for the five most
dominant forest groups, which together total nearly 93 percent of forestland in Florida (Table 2‐
4). For each forest type group, annual carbon sequestration rates were calculated by subtracting
carbon stocks in new stands (0‐years‐old) from carbon stocks in 15‐year‐old stands and dividing

The urban forest recommendation was calculated in two ways: the Primary goal expresses GHG
reductions due to urban forestry in terms of per capita emissions for metropolitan residents,
and the Secondary goal is expressed in terms of increased percent of canopy cover in urban
areas. Both goals are roughly equivalent in terms of the number of trees planted, at 6.7 million
trees annually (Primary goal) and 6.3 million trees annually (Secondary goal).
Primary Goal—Plant and maintain enough trees in urban areas to offset 2008 metropolitan
carbon emissions by 3 percent by 2025.
The following explains the step by step quantification of the cumulative impact on carbon
sequestration and avoided fossil fuel emissions of incrementally increasing the existing tree
canopy cover in Florida to offset 3 percent of 2008 metropolitan carbon emissions, the AFW‐2

Primary Goal. This would require the planting and maintenance of an additional 6.7 million
trees per year between 2009 and 2025.

1. 2008 Florida metropolitan emissions calculations
July 2007 U.S. Census Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) data were used to calculate the total
metropolitan population in Florida.18 In 2007, Florida had a total of 17.2 million people living in
MSA regions (Table 2‐6), which is more than 92 percent of Florida’s 2007 population of 18.6
million.19 Total metropolitan emissions were calculated by multiplying the 2005 statewide per
capita emissions (18 tCO2e per person per year)20 by the total metropolitan population, resulting
in a total estimated 2008 metropolitan emission of 309 MMtCO2e. To offset 3 percent of these
emissions by 2025, urban tree plantings would need to offset roughly 9.3 MMtCO2e in that year.

2. GHG calculations
This recommendation quantifies the urban forest planting needed to reduce 2008 metropolitan
emissions by 3 percent by 2025. GHG benefits are twofold: direct carbon sequestration by
planted trees, and avoided GHG emissions from strategic tree planting to reduce energy
demand due to heating and cooling.

A. Direct Carbon Sequestration by Urban Trees
The average annual per‐tree gross carbon sequestration value for urban trees was found by
dividing the total estimated annual carbon sequestration in Florida urban trees (1,016,000 tons
of carbon/year, equating to 3.73 million tCO2e/year) by the total number of urban trees (169,

D‐38
Appendix D

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
587,000).21 Annual gross carbon sequestration per urban tree was thus calculated as 0.006 metric
tons of carbon (0.022 tCO2e) per tree per year. Gross sequestration as calculated above does not
account for the emissions resulting from tree mortality, disposal, and decomposition. To
account for these emissions, the estimated gross carbon sequestration per tree was multiplied
by 0.72, which is the ratio of gross to net sequestration for urban trees reported by Nowak and
Crane (2002)22 and used in EPA’s Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.23 Annual
net carbon sequestration per urban tree in Florida is 0.004 metric tons of carbon (0.015 tCO2e)
per tree per year.
Since trees planted in one year continue to accumulate carbon in subsequent years, annual
carbon sequestration in any given year was calculated as the sum of carbon stored in trees
planted in that year, plus sequestration by trees that were planted in prior years. It was
assumed that new trees planted in urban areas in Florida would sequester carbon at a rate
consistent with sequestration by the average urban tree statewide.

B. Avoided GHG Emissions
The total avoided GHG benefits are a function of three different types of impacts: reduced
cooling demand, reduced demand for heating due to wind reduction, and increased demand for
heating due to wintertime shading. An average potential GHG reduction factor of 0.0651
tCO2e/tree/year for trees in the Gulf Coast/Hawaii climate region was calculated from data in
McPherson and Simpson in GTR‐PSW‐171 (Table 2‐7; Appendix A, Table V.8).24 The estimate
assumed that the trees planted are split among residential settings with pre‐1950, 1950–1980,
and post‐1980 homes using the default distribution for the Gulf Coast/Hawaii climate region
provided by McPherson and Simpson: 19 percent, 63 percent, and 18 percent, respectively. This
estimate further assumes a default distribution of trees planted around buildings, based on
measured data from existing urban canopy in the region.
To calculate potential avoided GHG emissions due to increased shading, it was assumed that all
of the new trees would be planted where they would have shading effects. It was further
assumed that medium‐sized evergreen trees would be planted, with average tree distribution
around buildings. Note that these fossil fuel reduction factors are average for existing buildings,
and do not necessarily assume that trees are optimally placed around buildings to maximize

C. Overall GHG Benefit of Urban Tree Planting
Total GHG benefits are calculated as the sum of direct carbon sequestration plus fossil fuel
offset from reduced cooling demand and wind reduction (Table 2‐8). If 6.7 million new urban
trees are planted in Florida every year, the combined carbon sequestration and fossil fuel offset
impact would be roughly 9.2 MMtCO2e in 2025, which meets the target of reducing 3 percent of
2008 metropolitan carbon emissions statewide by 2025.

D. Cost Analysis
Data are available on the costs and cost savings of urban tree planting in the Coastal Plains
Community Tree Guide (McPherson et al., 2006). Economic costs of tree planting take into
account the cost of tree planting and annual maintenance, including the costs of program
administration and waste disposal. Economic benefits of tree planting include the cost avoided
from reduced energy use. Data are also available on the estimated economic benefits of services
such as provision of clean air, hydrologic benefits such as stormwater control, and aesthetic
enhancement; however, these co‐benefits are not explicitly included in this analysis.
Costs and cost savings were estimated from published average annual costs and cost savings
over 40 years, provided by public and private parties, for a range of tree sizes. The cost estimate
used in this analysis, $15.65 per tree, was calculated as the average of four common tree species
(southern live oak, southern magnolia, dogwood, and loblolly pine) under public and private
management. Costs include tree and planting, pruning, removal and disposal, pest and disease,
infrastructure repair, irrigation, cleanup, liability and legal, administration, and other. A cost
savings due to reduced energy costs of ‐$14.35 per tree per year was also calculated as the
average of the same four tree species under public and private management. The average cost

and cost savings values yield a net cost of $1.30 per tree (costs minus cost savings). Table 2‐9

The cost savings is estimated using 40‐year averages; thus, it represents lifetime costs applicable
in the year planted and every year thereafter during the time frame of this analysis (for
example, planting costs $80/tree in the year the tree is planted; however, the 40‐year average
cost is $10/tree). To estimate total costs, $1.30/tree/year was multiplied by the cumulative
number of trees planted each year (Table 2‐10). This corresponds to a cumulative cost (or net
present value) of nearly $850 million from 2009 to 2025, with an estimated economic cost of
$10.23/tCO2e.

Secondary Goal—Increase the tree canopy coverage in all developed areas with a population
greater than 500 residents per square mile to 30 percent by 2025.
The following quantifies the cumulative impact on carbon sequestration and avoided fossil fuel
emissions of incrementally increasing the existing tree canopy cover in Florida. Specifically,
AFW‐2 Secondary Goal seeks to achieve a goal of 30 percent tree canopy cover in all developed
areas with a population greater than 500 residents per square mile by 2025. Currently, Florida’s
urban areas are 18.4 percent forested.25 This goal thus recommends an incremental 63 percent
increase over existing urban canopy cover by 2025.

1. GHG calculations
Currently, Florida contains 169,587,000 million urban trees; this recommendation quantifies the
effect of adding a total of approximately 107 million new trees by 2025. The number of trees
planted each year is constant at roughly 6.3 million/year, with the target number of trees
planted by 2025.

GHG benefits are twofold: direct carbon sequestration by planted trees, and avoided GHG
emissions from strategic tree planting to reduce energy demand due to heating and cooling.

A. Direct Carbon Sequestration by Urban Trees
The average annual per‐tree gross carbon sequestration value for urban trees was found by
dividing the total estimated annual carbon sequestration in Florida urban trees (1,016,000 tons
of carbon/year, equating to 3.73 MMtCO2e/year) by the total number of urban trees. Annual
gross carbon sequestration per urban tree was thus calculated as 0.006 metric tons of carbon
(0.022 tCO2e) per tree per year. Gross sequestration as calculated above does not account for the
emissions resulting from tree mortality, disposal, and decomposition. To account for these
emissions, the estimated gross carbon sequestration per tree was multiplied by 0.72, which is
the ratio of gross to net sequestration for urban trees reported by Nowak and Crane (2002)26 and
used in EPA’s Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.27 Annual net carbon
sequestration per urban tree in Florida is 0.004 tC (0.015 tCO2e) per tree per year.
Since trees planted in one year continue to accumulate carbon in subsequent years, annual
carbon sequestration in any given year was calculated as the sum of carbon stored in trees
planted in that year, plus sequestration by trees that were planted in prior years. It was
assumed that new trees planted in urban areas in Florida would sequester carbon at a rate
consistent with sequestration by the average urban tree statewide.

B. Avoided GHG Emissions
The total avoided GHG benefits are a function of three different types of impacts: reduced
cooling demand, reduced demand for heating due to wind reduction, and increased demand for
heating due to wintertime shading. An average potential GHG reduction factor of 0.0651
tCO2e/tree/year for trees in the Gulf Coast/Hawaii climate region was calculated from data in
McPherson and Simpson in GTR‐PSW‐171 (Table 2‐11; Appendix A, Table V.8).28 The estimate
assumed that the trees planted are split among residential settings with pre‐1950, 1950–1980,
and post‐1980 homes using the default distribution for the Gulf Coast/Hawaii climate region
provided by McPherson and Simpson of 19 percent, 63 percent, and 18 percent, respectively.
This estimate further assumes a default distribution of trees planted around buildings, based on
measured data from existing urban canopy in the region.

D. Cost Analysis
Data are available on the costs and cost savings of urban tree planting in the Coastal Plains
Community Tree Guide (McPherson et al., 2006). Economic costs of tree planting take into
account the cost of tree planting and annual maintenance costs, including the costs of program
administration and waste disposal. Economic benefits of tree planting include the cost avoided
from reduced energy use. Data are also available on the estimated economic benefits of services
such as provision of clean air, hydrologic benefits such as storm water control, and aesthetic
enhancement; however, these co‐benefits are not explicitly included in this analysis.
Costs and cost savings were estimated from published average annual costs and cost savings
over 40 years, provided by public and private parties, for a range of tree sizes. The cost estimate
used in this analysis, $15.65 per tree, was calculated as the average of four common tree species
(southern live oak, southern magnolia, dogwood, and loblolly pine) under public and private
management. A cost savings of ‐$14.35 per tree per year was also calculated as the average of
the same four tree species under public and private management. The average cost and cost
savings values yield a net cost of $1.30 per tree (costs minus cost savings). Table 2‐13 shows
estimated economic costs and cost savings for all categories.

The cost savings are estimated using 40‐year averages, thus this represents lifetime costs
applicable in the year planted and every year thereafter during the timeframe of this analysis
(for example, planting costs $80/tree in the year the tree is planted; however, the 40‐year
average cost is $10/tree). To estimate total costs, $1.30/tree was multiplied by the cumulative
number of trees planted each year (Table 2‐14). This corresponds to a NPV of $759 million from
2009 ‐ 2025, with an estimated economic cost of $9.75/tCO2e.

Key Uncertainties
Cities and communities would need to conduct canopy surveys to establish a baseline of
current canopy cover. The costs of such a survey and continued monitoring are variable and
may exceed available resources. The longevity of urban trees may be affected by climate
perturbations.

Additional Benefits, Costs, and Energy Security Fuel Savings
In addition to the numerous benefits articulated in the policy description, urban trees contribute
to improved property values, add aesthetic value for residents and visitors, provide humidity
balancing, and reduce the intensity of storm water runoff. Sociological studies suggest that
more attractive and comfortable neighborhoods have lower crime rates.
Total GHG emissions avoided is 62.649 MMtCO2e/year.
Total fossil fuel displaced during the policy period is 3.5 million short tons coal or 76,000 cubic
feet natural gas.

AFW-3. Forest Management for Carbon Sequestration

Policy Description
Encourage management activities that promote forest productivity and increase the amount of
carbon sequestered in forest biomass, soils, and in long‐lived wood products. Practices may
include thinning and density management, prescribed burning and risk reduction, and
management of insects and disease. Reduce the severity of wildfires to reduce GHG emissions
by lowering the forest carbon lost during a fire and by maintaining carbon sequestration
potential. Similarly, reducing damage from insects, disease, and invasive plants reduces GHG
emissions by maintaining the carbon sequestration potential of healthy forests.
Note that this policy has overlap with AFW‐1, Forest Retention—Reduced Conversion of Forested to
Non‐Forested Land Uses and AFW‐2, Afforestation and Restoration of Non‐Forested Lands.

Policy Design
Goals:
Practice improved forest management for carbon sequestration to achieve an increase of at least
10 percent in productivity for the state’s forestry plantations by 2025.
Practice improved forest management for carbon sequestration on 25 percent of non‐Federal
publicly managed upland forest lands.
Timing: Assume linear ramp‐up
Parties Involved: Florida private forestland owners, DOF, Florida Forestry Association, FWC,
UF IFAS, NRCS, nongovernmental agencies, RPCs, other state land management agencies,
USFS, US FWS, USACE, other federal land management and technical assistance agencies, the
Nature Conservancy, forest industry, REITs, TIMOs, and private landowners, state government,
and U.S. federal government.
Other: Management intensity for carbon sequestration on publicly owned forested lands
should be consistent with biodiversity and other goals within the acquisition and management
plans for those lands.

Implementation Mechanisms
The Action Team encourages the Florida Energy and Climate Commission to continue
assessment and recommendations for appropriate implementation mechanisms for this policy.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
For silviculture, best management practices (BMPs) developed by DACS, DEP, and IFAS relate
to water quality protection and water conservation. Note: Florida currently has very high
compliance with BMPs.
The FWC’s Landowner Assistance Program provides wildlife‐related habitat management
recommendations towards long‐term partnerships with private landowners that lead to the
restoration and conservation of high priority habitats, identified in Florida’s Wildlife Action
Plan (http://myfwc.com/wildlifelegacy/). Recommendations include restoring native
groundcover, overstory species, planting new pine stands at low densities, and thinning
existing stands to benefit carbon sequestration, wildlife habitats, and forest health.

Quantification Methods:
This policy recommendation seeks to quantify the impact of enhanced management intensity on
a portion of Florida’s upland forest land. The goal is described in two parts: enhanced
management intensity in privately‐owned pine plantations, and enhanced management
intensity on non‐Federal publicly owned lands. Since the methodology for both types of land
ownerships is identical but only the target acreage differs, the two types of land area are
combined in the methodology that follows.

1. Carbon sequestration due to enhanced management intensity
Pine plantations make up roughly 32 percent of total forest area in Florida, covering a total of
4.6 million acres as of 2005 (Brown, 2007). Of these, most are in longleaf‐slash pine forest (3.6
million acres) with the remaining 1.0 million acres in loblolly‐shortleaf pine forest. Mulkey et al.
(2008) describe scenarios for improving management in pine plantations, suggesting that carbon
sequestration gains averaging 29 to35 percent are possible in these forest types. As the goal
statement describes improving productivity “at least 10 percent,” and there is published
evidence to support productivity gains even larger than this, the recommendation was
quantified using methods and data presented in Mulkey et al. (2008). It was assumed that
similar carbon sequestration gains were possible on publicly‐owned upland forests.
Improved management practices such as fertilization, irrigation, and enhanced thinning
regimes can enhance the carbon sequestration possible in pine plantations in Florida (Mulkey et
al. 2008). Switching an acre of plantation from low to medium intensity management results in a
net C sequestration gain of 0.25 tons/acre/year, while switching from medium to high intensity
management results in a net gain of 0.39 tons/acre/year (Table 3‐1).

Enhanced management intensity: privately‐owned pine plantations

Of the softwood plantation area totaling 4.6 million acres in 2005, it was assumed that 37
percent of this (1.7 million acres) is currently under low‐intensity management, and that 58
percent (2.7 million acres) is currently under medium intensity management (Table D‐3‐2),
based on results presented by Mulkey (2008). No change was assumed for the five percent of
plantation acreage already under high intensity management in 2005. For quantification of

GHG benefits for this recommendation based on recommendations of the TWG, 33 percent of
the acreage currently in low intensity management would move to medium intensity, and a
maximum of 10 percent of pine plantation area would be under a high management regime at
any one time. A summary of the current acreage and the target acreage under each
management intensity category appears in Table D‐3‐2.

For each incremental increase in management intensity, the number of acres that would be
moved into the new management category were multiplied by the expected resultant gain in C
sequestration (0.25 tons per acre per year from low to medium intensity, and 0.39 tons per acre
per year for medium to high intensity) (Table D‐3‐1). As acreage would continue to be managed
according to the new regime in subsequent years, the incremental C gain was quantified for the
cumulative acreage under the new management regime (Table D‐3‐3). Carbon stored in
harvested wood products (HWP) was added to the cumulative total (see below for HWP
methodology).

Enhanced management intensity: non‐Federal publicly owned forests

Roughly 18 percent of forest land in Florida – 2.9 million acres – is owned by non‐Federal
entities (Table D‐3‐4A). Of this, roughly 1.6 million acres are upland forest types (including
longleaf‐slash pine, loblolly‐shortleaf pine, oak‐pine, and oak‐hickory types) (Table D‐3‐4B).
This policy recommendation seeks to enhance management intensity on 25 percent of this non‐
Federal upland forest area (413,687 acres) by 2025.

calculated above for pine plantations was available to all non‐Federal upland timberland,
regardless of forest type. Results of this analysis for non‐Federal upland forests appear below.

2. Estimated Increases in Carbon Sequestration Rates and Growing‐Stock Volumes
To quantify the increment in growing‐stock volume (and storage in harvested wood products
(HWP)) due to enhanced management, a standard approach based on USDA Forest Service
(USDA FS) methodology was used. For some regions and forest types, USDA‐FS provides
estimates of carbon and volume growth increments for both average‐ and high‐productivity
stands. Such tables are available for loblolly‐shortleaf pine and longleaf‐slash pine in the
Southeast region.29 Growing‐stock volume data in the USDA‐FS tables were used to calculate
growing stock volume for average‐ and high‐productivity longleaf‐slash pine and loblolly‐
shortleaf pine forests in Florida. These USFS‐published tables were not used above to calculate
incremental C storage due to enhanced management, because it was assumed that State‐specific

data related to particular classes of management intensity were preferable to the broad
“productivity classes” referred to in the USDA‐FS methodology.
An average over 30 years is assumed to encompass the range of age classes for this forest type,
though in reality, growth rates vary by stand age. A comparison of expected growing stock
volumes for average longleaf‐slash and loblolly‐shortleaf pine stands with volumes expected on
high productivity sites30 shows that, on average, 30‐year‐old stands growing on high‐
productivity sites will have a growing‐stock volume that is about 3,409 cubic feet per acre larger
than average stands.
USFS HWP accounting methods were used to convert the 3,409‐cubic‐feet‐per‐acre (cf/acre)
incremental increase in growing‐stock volume into the equivalent carbon volume of 25.5
tC/acre. Note that this is the carbon stored in the incremental increase in growing stock, only a
portion of which is removed during harvest (this analysis assumes 35 percent is removed, see
below).

3. Calculation of Net Carbon Stock Change in HWP
The incremental increase in carbon removed during harvest is calculated by multiplying the
number of acres harvested each year by 35 percent of the carbon increase in growing‐stock
volume (i.e., 35 percent of 25.5 tC/acre = 8.9 tC/acre). This assumes that 35 percent of the
growing‐stock volume is removed during a harvest (based on a study of carbon removals at
different harvest levels, 35 percent is roughly the proportion removed from moderate harvest
levels).31 The number of acres harvested was calculated by assuming 2.8 percent of the acres
treated each year are harvested the following year for pine plantations, and two percent of the
acres treated each year are harvested the following year on non‐federal public lands (Table D‐3‐
7).

Standard USFS HWP accounting methods were used to estimate the incremental increase in
harvested carbon that remains stored in HWP indefinitely. The amount of carbon stored in
HWP carbon stocks is time‐dependent relative to the year of harvest (carbon stocks are high
initially and decrease over time as a result of disposal and decay), making carbon stock
accounting for HWP complex. Therefore, an approach has been developed to standardize and
simplify HWP carbon accounting, which applies the amount of carbon still stored in HWP 100
years after harvest as the estimated net increase in HWP carbon stocks; this gain is attributed to
the year of harvest.

stored in HWP 100 years after harvest.32 Therefore, the long‐term storage of carbon in HWP
increases by approximately 2.1 tC/acre when stands increase management intensity (for
example, an additional 8.9 tC/acre are harvested, of which 20 percent remains stored
indefinitely). The results of this combined HWP analysis, for both pine plantations and upland
non‐Federal public ownerships, are shown in Table D‐3‐8. (Results are separated by ownership
category in Tables D‐3‐3 and D‐3‐7).

4. Economic costs and benefits
The cost of enhanced forest management in Florida was estimated based on regional data for
low, medium, and high intensity management33. Costs were originally separated by initiation
costs and maintenance costs (Table D‐3‐9). These per‐acre costs were assumed to be the lifetime
cost for stand management under each type of management regime, and were divided by
rotation age (Mulkey et al. 2008; Table D‐3‐1) to derive an estimate of management costs per
year at each level of management intensity (Table D‐3‐10). It was assumed that only the
incremental costs of switching to the higher intensity management regime would apply, as
management costs at current intensity are included in “business as usual” practices. Costs for
road construction and fire line construction were not included in the calculations. These annual
incremental costs ($/acre/year) were applied to each acre in each year of the policy
implementation period (Tables D‐3‐11 and D‐3‐12).

Annual costs of implementing AFW‐3 in pine plantations and on non‐federal publicly owned
land were discounted using a five percent rate to convert future dollars to present values. The
sum of annual discounted costs from 2009 to 2025 yields an estimate of the NPV of this policy,
which is roughly $84 million for enhanced management of pine plantations, and $41 million for
enhanced management of non‐Federal publicly owned forests (Tables D‐3‐11 and D‐3‐12). The
cost‐effectiveness is calculated by dividing the NPV by the cumulative GHG benefit, yielding a
cost‐effectiveness of $10.65/tCO2e saved.

Key Assumptions: As identified in the text above.

Key Uncertainties
The estimate of costs estimated above does not include any additional future value of the
incremental timber/pulpwood that is available as a result of the implementation of this
recommendation. For the most part, these additional economic benefits would be realized after
the end of the policy period (2030). If the methods for estimating net costs and cost effectiveness
were to take into consideration the additional future value of this biomass, then the costs for the
recommendation could be considerably lower.

AFW-4. Expanded Use of Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW)
Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, and Steam Production

Policy Description
Increase the amount of biomass available from agriculture, forestry, and municipal solid waste
(MSW) for generating electricity and displacing the use of fossil energy sources. Local electricity
or steam production yields the greatest net energy payoff. This biomass should be used in an
environmentally acceptable manner, considering proper facility siting and feedstock use (for
example, proximity of users to biomass, impact on water supply and quality, control of air
emissions, solid waste management, cropping management, nutrient management, soil and
non‐soil carbon management, and impact on biodiversity and wildlife habitat). The objective is
to create concurrent reduction of CO2 due to displacement of fossil fuel, considering life cycle
GHG emissions associated with viable collection, hauling, energy conversion, and energy
distribution systems.
Develop a long‐term sustainable supply of reasonable cost biomass for generating electricity,
heat, and steam. Promote enhanced growth of long rotation, short rotation, and dedicated
energy crops, as well as collection of biomass residues.
Provide incentives that will result in an increase in the use of waste‐to‐energy (WTE) and other
waste‐based energy technologies, and the recovery of landfill methane (CH4) gas. These
technologies make a two‐fold contribution to climate protection: the discharge of CH4 and other
GHG into the atmosphere is reduced, and the burning of fossil fuels is replaced with recovered
energy.
Note that this recommendation is linked to recommendations in ESD‐3 and ESD‐5a which will have
biomass demand requirements.

Policy Design
Goals:
Primary: Increase the use of renewable energy from biomass feedstocks by 500 percent by 2025.
Secondary: By 2025, energy crops should increase by 10 percent. The acres of land producing
ecologically sustainable energy crops are to increase up to an additional 300,000 acres by 2025,
increase the current generation of renewable energy from WTE facilities by 20 percent by 2025,
and increase the number of uncontrolled MSW landfills recovering CH4 as an energy source,
such that 50 percent of the landfill gas generated is controlled by 2020.
Timing: see goals above.

Other: Out of approximately 200 open and closed landfills in the state, only about 13 sites are
currently recovering landfill CH4 for energy use. Currently, 11 WTE plants are operating in
Florida, generating 513 megawatts (MW) of electricity.
Overall, policies need to decrease the risk and uncertainties associated with having sustainable
supplies of good quality biomass at reasonable costs for the planned lifetime of the electrical,
heat, or steam producing facility. It is likely that a wide array of policies will be needed that
influence land and conversion facility owners to dedicate themselves to using biomass
feedstocks to produce renewable power.
Note the strong linkage to the energy supply sector, since WTE plants are active in the state.
Also may consider new technologies, such as plasma arc.

Implementation Mechanisms
Provide incentives for biomass production.
Provide purchase guarantees to biomass producers.
Provide grants or incentives to develop Florida‐based projects to utilize landfill gas.
Provide landowner incentives for energy crops to be planted on marginal agricultural land or
reclaimed mining land and incentives for reforestation.
Provide incentives such as renewable energy credits for diverting waste from landfills to waste‐
to‐energy.
Improve the ability/opportunity for producers to connect to the grid.

Consider the following feedstock sources:
•

Long‐rotation forests—Need to promote the use of wood for electricity, steam, and heat in
Florida by providing subsidies, tax credits, or payment schemes that enable landowners to
conduct proper thinning and removals that benefit the health of the forest and decrease the
chances of catastrophic wild fire. Promote the development of biomass utilizing facilities in
appropriate locations that contain sufficient biomass, but do not already contain commercial
conversion facilities, by providing the infrastructure needed to support the development
and transport of woody biomass. Promote development and deployment of advanced forest

management practices (for example, faster growing genetic stock with improved wood
properties for conversion to electricity, steam, and heat) that sustainably increases yields of
biomass across the rotation.

•

Short‐rotation forests—Need to promote the development and commercial deployment of
select and dedicated‐forest tree species in Florida by providing the following possibilities:
(1) establish guarantees or give subsidies for converting land near enough to facilities to
short rotation forests, offering low cost loans (to help overcome initial lack of cash flow); (2)
create landowner technical assistance programs; (3) promote stable and efficient markets for
wood and residues from short rotation forests by creation of incentives for producing
electricity, steam, and heat from this source of biomass; (4) create opportunities for
conversion facility owners to partner with existing landowners to establish long‐term
supply agreements; and (5) develop equipment and methods that can efficiently harvest and
transport stems and residues to facilities that produce electricity, steam, and heat.

Other Energy Crops
•

MSW biomass— Promote the use of MSW biomass as defined in 366.91 F.S. for production of
electricity by improving the market value through inclusion in a Renewable Portfolio
Standard (RPS). Enhanced revenue from electrical generation that will result from sales of
credits in an RPS may encourage the construction of new MSW biomass facilities as an
alternative to landfilling, and offset the production of methane (a more powerful GHG than
CO2) that may occur if the waste is disposed of in a landfill. As an indigenous and
sustainable fuel, MSW biomass can best be utilized by avoiding long‐distance transport of
the material, and instead developing appropriately sized local facilities to use this energy
source. Local facilities also assist in electrical reliability by providing distributed generating
capacity.

•

Agriculture and forestry residues—Promote the use of forest residues by developing the
technical means and improving the financial returns that make use of these residues
commercially viable. Possibilities include promoting research into harvesting, collection and
compaction for transportation, and subsidies to promote their use at conversion facilities.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Executive Order 07‐127 includes a request to the Public Service Commission (PSC) to establish
an RPS that would require utilities to obtain 20 percent of generation from renewable sources.
Presumably this would create demand for biomass feedstocks.
DOF promotes the development of woody biomass.
Existing statutory prohibitions promote the separate collection of yard waste biomass.
A recent shift in demand for pine biomass may result in increased availability of biomass from
pine for the use of energy production. The demand for pulpwood in Florida has been
decreasing due to the loss of pulp and paper mills in the state. A consequence could be a shift in

end use of biomass from pine away from pulp and paper industries and towards biofuel and
energy industries.

Data Sources:
See footnotes in documentation below for data sources. CCS consulted experts from the Solid
Waste Authority of Palm Beach County, Wheelabrator Technologies, Inc. (WTI), and Waste
Management, Inc. (WM).

Quantification Methods:
The primary goal was quantified based on the quantity of biomass supplied as an energy
feedstock in the baseline year 2005. In 2005, biomass utilization was estimated to be
approximately 84 trillion BTUs in the residential, commercial and industrial (RCI) sector and
approximately 49 trillion BTUs in the energy supply sector. This provides a total biomass
feedstock utilization baseline of approximately 133 trillion BTUs in 2005. Achieving an increase
to 500 percent of this 2005 level would require an additional34 499 trillion BTUs of biomass
supply by 2025 from energy crops, forestry, agriculture residues, waste to energy, and landfill
gas feedstocks. The goal quantification is outlined in table 4‐1.

34

This is the amount required above business as usual projections and is shown in column 5 of Table 4‐1.

This analysis focuses on the incremental GHG benefits associated with the utilization of
additional biomass to offset the consumption of fossil fuels. It assumes that biomass will be
used to replace a combination of coal, natural gas and oil based on the relative generation from
each feedstock in Florida (36 percent Coal, 43 percent Natural Gas and 21 percent oil; it is
assumed that biomass would not replace nuclear).36
The GHG benefits were calculated by the difference in emissions associated with each of the
input fuels (0.0959 tCO2e/MMBtu for sub‐bituminous coal, 0.0539 tCO2e/MMBtu for natural gas,

Energy from Biomass Costs
The cost calculation has two main components: fuel costs and capital/operational/maintenance
costs. The fuel component is based on the difference in costs between supply of biomass fuel
and the assumed fossil fuel that it is replacing (for instance, coal, natural gas, or oil). The
assumed biomass fuel cost used in this analysis is indicated in Table 4‐3.

Note that the proportion of each biomass feedstock used to meet the goal was based on the
proportion of availability for each feedstock. Note that current estimates indicate that there is
insufficient supply to meet the biomass goal for the listed feedstocks, and that other biomass
sources would be needed to meet the goal (for example, municipal solid waste biomass; see
Table 1 at the front of this appendix).
The cost is calculated by assuming the replacement of fossil fuel with biomass. The difference in
costs (dollars per million British thermal units [$/MMBtu]), is multiplied by the amount of
energy (coal, natural gas, or oil in MMBtu) being replaced by biomass (taken from AEO
Supplemental tables42). The assumed incremental capital costs are based on the capital costs

Capital costs and operational and maintenance costs were taken from Table 38 of the EIA AEO

incremental costs for biomass are outlined in table 4‐4. While use of biomass may be pursued
through other technology types (for example, gasification) or end uses (for example, heat or
steam), this methodology was used to provide an estimate of possible additional capital and

In the Key Uncertainties section below, the results of a separate assessment on biomass
utilization are presented which assume that the biomass will be used strictly as co‐fired fuel in
existing coal‐fired equipment. That assessment assumes no significant outlay of capital costs are
needed to utilize the biomass; hence the results are based just on the difference in supplied fuels
(coal versus biomass).

The capital costs associated with using biomass as an alternative to fossil‐based generation are dependent on many
factors, including the end use (i.e., electricity, heat, or steam), the design and size of the system, the technology
employed, and the configuration specifications of the system. Each system implemented under this policy would
require a detailed analysis (incorporating specific engineering design and costs aspects) to provide a more accurate
cost estimate of the system.

be five percent giving a capital recovery factor of 0.065 (i.e., a $1 million plant is assumed to cost
approximately $65,000 per year over the life of the project).

Landfill Gas‐to‐Energy (LFGTE) GHG Benefit
This section quantifies the benefits of the secondary goal of methane capture from landfills. As
the goal stated in the above Policy Design section requires control of methane emissions
specifically from uncontrolled landfills, CCS is able to use the emission estimates for
uncontrolled landfills from the Florida I&F as the baseline emission scenario. The goal was
adjusted to account for emissions already controlled through LFGTE projects and landfill
methane flares, yielding an incremental goal that—coupled with the BAU LFGTE activities—
would lead to 50 percent control of all landfill methane through LFGTE projects. Table 4‐6
displays the projected BAU emissions from uncontrolled, flared, and LFGTE landfills, as well as
the incremental LFG utilized for energy generation.

______________________________________________________________________________
As emissions from uncontrolled landfills are controlled, three GHG benefits are realized: the
conversion of landfill methane to CO2, the displacement of grid‐based electricity, and the
displacement of fossil fuel combustion for direct heat.46 The first benefit is calculated by
multiplying the baseline CH4 emissions from uncontrolled landfills from the Florida I&F by the
LFG control goal set by the Action Team. This benefit does not apply to LFG that is flared under
BAU. The second benefit (offset electricity) is found by converting the methane captured from
tCO2e units to cubic meters of gas, then calculating the electricity generated and the emissions
offset through avoided grid‐based generation.47 The third GHG benefit is calculated by
multiplying the fraction of captured LFG combusted for direct use by the quantity of LFG
captured under this policy, assuming that an equal amount of natural gas is not combusted for
direct heat use. The estimated GHG benefits in 2017 and 2025 are 1.07 and 5.63 MMtCO2e,
respectively. The cumulative GHG benefit through 2025 is estimated to be 32.0 MMtCO2e. Table
4‐7 depicts the results of these calculations.

LFGTE Cost‐Effectiveness
Using the results from a previous LFGcost model run, the costs of this policy are estimated
based on whether the methane is converted to usable energy by a small engine, through direct
use, or a by large engine (800 kW and greater).48,49,50 CCS assumes that the current share of each
of the three energy conversion techniques remains constant as uncontrolled sites are converted
to control sites to meet the policy goal (Table 4‐8), based on the national average share of each
technology.
The average cost‐effectiveness ($1.57/tCO2e) is multiplied by the GHG benefit calculated in the
above GHG Benefits section for each year to determine the cost‐effectiveness of this policy
(Table 4‐9). The NPV of costs incurred through the policy’s implementation is $28 million, and
the discounted cost‐effectiveness is $1/tCO2e (assumes no escalation of costs during the policy
period).

Waste‐to‐Energy (WTE) GHG Benefits
This section quantifies the benefits of the secondary goal of waste‐to‐energy utilization. The
baseline WTE utilization in Florida was based on the average tonnage of waste combusted in
Florida between 2001 and 2006.51 This number was multiplied by the energy content and heat
rate of MSW52 to yield the baseline electricity generation. Both the baseline tonnage of waste
combusted and electricity generated were multiplied by the Action Team goal of a 20 percent
increase in WTE electricity generated to yield the incremental tonnage combusted and
electricity generated for the year 2025. The electricity generated is multiplied by the emissions

WAste Reduction Model (WARM).” Version 8, May 2006. Available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange//
wycd/waste/calculators/WARM_home.html. EPA created WARM to help solid waste planners and organizations
track and voluntarily report GHG emission reductions from several different waste management practices. WARM is
available both as a Web‐based calculator and as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. WARM calculates and totals GHG
emissions of baseline and alternative waste management practices—source reduction, recycling, combustion,
composting, and landfilling. The model calculates emissions in tCe, tCO2e, and energy units (MMBtu) across a wide
range of material types commonly found in MSW. For an explanation of the methodology, see the EPA report Solid

WTE Cost‐effectiveness
Based on an additional net cost of $0.79 per ton of waste processed at a WTE facility,54 the NPV
of this target was estimated to be $3 million, with a cost‐effectiveness of $1/tCO2e. This
incremental cost figure is based on the average difference in MSW gate rates in different waste
management districts across Florida.
Another estimate of the incremental cost of diverting additional waste from landfills to WTE
facilities is based on a facility in Palm Beach County. The incremental cost between disposing
waste in the county’s landfill system and WTE facility is $18.56/ton MSW.55 However, as Palm
Beach County’s incineration facility is a refuse derived fuel facility (also known as an RDF), the
Action Team did not feel that this cost is representative of the true incremental cost of waste
incineration in Florida. Rather, it was suggested that future WTE facilities will likely be of the
“mass burn” variety, rather than RDF facilities.

Key Assumptions:
Biomass
The analysis assumes that biomass will be used to replace a combination of coal, natural gas,
and oil based on the relative generation from each feedstock in Florida (36 percent Coal, 43
percent Natural Gas and 21 percent oil; it is assumed that biomass would not replace nuclear).
A separate assessment is presented in the Key Uncertainties section below that looks at the
potential difference in costs, if the recommendation was implemented strictly as a biomass co‐
firing recommendation.

LFGTE
The analysis does not factor in the closure of specific landfills or the adoption of LFG controls at
specific landfills. Modeling GHG emissions and reductions at individual sites is beyond the
scope of this analysis; however, the approach used is consistent with the methods used to
develop the GHG forecast for the waste management sector.
Each of the cost inputs above contains key assumptions; additional study of these inputs could
reduce the associated uncertainty in the cost estimates.

WTE
The two key assumptions regarding the analysis of the WTE goal are that the BAU tonnage of
waste treated at WTE facilities will not increase over time and that the incremental waste
treated at WTE facilities is 100 percent biomass, thus having no net GHG emissions.
It was also assumed that all additional waste treated at WTE facilities will be treated at mass
burn facilities, rather than RDF facilities. Based on the information provided to CCS by the
TWG, mass burn facilities will have a lower net cost than RDF facilities.

Key Uncertainties
The capital costs associated with using biomass as an alternative to fossil‐based generation are
dependent on many factors, including the end use (i.e., electricity, heat, or steam), the design
and size of the system, the technology employed, and the configuration specifications of the
system. Each system implemented under this policy would require a detailed analysis
(incorporating specific engineering design and costing aspects) to provide a more accurate cost
estimate of the system. Co‐firing coal and biomass in existing conventional coal‐fired power
stations presents a significant opportunity. Demonstrations and tests indicate that biomass can
provide up to 15 percent of the total energy input (i.e. replace up to 15 percent of the coal
feedstock) with only minor modifications to the existing system.56 The analysis conducted above
assumes that biomass replaces a combination fuel mix of coal, natural gas, and oil. The analysis
below indicates possible GHG emission reductions and costs if all biomass displaced coal

Cumulative

The amount of biomass used of each type is based on the availability of each feedstock (22
percent, 41 percent forestry, 37 percent energy crops). As can be seen above, the GHG benefits
increase and the costs decrease if the analysis assumes biomass replaces coal through co‐firing
due to coal having greater emissions and lower cost than other feedstocks such as natural gas.
These results indicate a cost effectiveness of $13/tCO2e versus $23/tCO2e for the analysis above
which included the consideration of capital costs for new capacity.
The future price of electricity will affect the analysis.

______________________________________________________________________________
The incremental cost of diverting additional waste from landfills to WTE facilities is based on
current gate rates, which may be subsidized in some counties. Therefore, the estimated cost of
this target may not represent the true social cost. However, as most cost information at
privately‐run facilities is proprietary, CCS was unable to base their estimates on more specific
cost data. Rather, CCS utilized publicly available information (MSW gate rates) to estimate the
cost effectiveness of the WTE goal.

Additional Benefits, Costs and Energy Security Fuel Savings
The expansion of crops as an energy feedstock needs to ensure that the energy crops are grown
on appropriate land and in ways that do not damage terrestrial or aquatic resources nor
displace food production.
Consideration of recycling, source reduction, and organics management was suggested during
a public comments session. The Florida Action Team notes that HB 7135 (Section 95. Section
403.7032, Florida Statutes,) includes a provision for 75 percent recycling as follows:
“By the year 2020, the long‐term goal for the recycling efforts of state and local governmental
entities, private companies and organizations, and the general public is to reduce the amount of
recyclable solid waste disposed of in waste management facilities, landfills, or incineration
facilities by a statewide average of at least 75 percent. However, any solid waste used for the
production of renewable energy shall count toward the long term recycling goal as set forth in
this section.”
Another concern expressed in comments from the public is that combustion of MSW in waste‐
to‐energy plants produces non‐GHG air emissions, including criteria and toxic air pollutants.
The Florida Action Team acknowledges this concern and notes that existing federal and state
regulatory programs are in place that require the Maximum Achievable Control Technology
(for example, waste sorting, combustion processes, pollution controls) to reduce emissions and
to provide reasonable assurance that both the existing and any future waste‐to‐energy facilities
are designed and operated to minimize these emissions. These regulations can be amended in
the future to lower emission limits if control technologies improve. It should also be noted that
MSW waste‐to‐energy offers the potential to offset emissions from other sources, such as
mercury emissions from coal‐fired power plants, while also lowering GHG emissions.
Consideration of new waste‐to‐energy facilities should carefully consider net benefits of MSW
waste‐to‐energy and the energy sources they displace.
Total fossil fuel displaced during the policy period is 22 million short tons coal or 486,000 cubic
feet natural gas.

AFW-5. Promotion of Farming Practices That Achieve GHG Benefits

Policy Description
The amount of carbon stored in the soil can be increased by the adoption of practices, such as
conservation, no‐till cultivation, and crop rotation. Provide incentives to farmers for using
production practices that achieve net GHG benefits, such as no‐till cultivation or biotechnology
crops requiring reduced chemical or fuel use. Other benefits include reduced wind and water
erosion, reduced fuel consumption, and improved wildlife habitat.
Convert marginal agricultural land used for annual crops to permanent cover (for example,
grassland/rangeland, grove, or forest) where the soil carbon or carbon in biomass is higher
under the new land use. Provide incentives to producers to prevent grassland from returning
either to conventionally tilled production or to suburban/urban development.
Improve the efficiency of fertilizer use and other nitrogen‐based soil amendments through
implementation of FDACS Best Management Practices (BMPs) manuals and support of
biotechnology crops. Excess nitrogen not metabolized by plants can leach into groundwater and
be emitted to the atmosphere as nitrous oxide (N2O). Better nutrient utilization can lead to
lower N2O emissions from runoff.
This recommendation has potential linkages with the Cap and Trade Technical Working Group (provision
for carbon offsets).

Policy Design
Goals:
•

Soil Carbon Management—By 2025, implement cultivation practices to enhance soil carbon
levels on 40 percent of the acreage not already using these practices.

•

Agriculture Land Conversion—Promote conversion of marginal agricultural land to higher
sequestration permanent cover.

•

Nutrient Management—Increase efficiency of fertilizer use by 25 percent in 2025, compared
with business as usual (BAU).

•

Improved Harvesting Methods—Promote increased efficiency of energy use in harvesting.

Timing: Meet intermediate goals by 2015 if appropriate incentives are in place.
Parties Involved: UF IFAS, Florida Farm Bureau (FFB), all commodity groups, FDACS, USDA‐
NRCS, and DEP.

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Other: Numeric goals for agricultural land conversion and harvesting to be set after initial
analysis of reduction potentials for these goals.

•

Voluntary, incentive‐based programs are preferred over command and control regulation.

•

Also water quality/quantity, economics, and other environmental benefits need to be taken
into consideration when adopting certain practices.

•

Research, extension, technology, and biotechnology must be embraced for increased yields
and improved harvesting techniques.

Implementation Mechanisms
Cap‐and‐Trade—This recommendation has links to Cap‐and‐Trade policy recommendations of
the Action Team Process. A Cap‐and‐Trade program may provide incentives for adoption of
improved farming techniques provided that appropriate offset programs are developed as part
of the program.
Conservation Tillage—Provide low‐interest loans for conversion to no‐till or low‐till.
Cost Share and Incentive Programs—Promote FDACS‐BMP cost‐share programs. Provide
incentives for early adopters of improved farming techniques.
Marginal Agriculture Land—The Action Team did not feel comfortable setting a goal for this
recommendation without a better idea of the amount of marginal agricultural land in the state.
Research should be done to determine a useable definition of marginal agricultural land for the
state of Florida and the number of marginal acres in the state. Then, the state can reassess the
best methods for increasing the carbon sequestration and other benefits of this land.
Nutrient Management—The rising cost of fertilizer has provided an immediate incentive to
farmers to improve their nutrient efficiency. Improved timing of application can allow for
greater uptake of nitrogen (N), thus requiring less overall N application.
Consultation with Dr. Brian Boman at the University of Florida provided some clarification on
the feasibility of improved N efficiency in the state. He recommended a variety of
recommendations that could potentially improve nitrogen efficiency. Nitrogen loss comes from
intense rainfall, which can happen at any time of the year in Florida, so improved timing of N
application has fewer benefits than it does in most states. Controlled release fertilizers could
improve the efficiency of N uptake, but these are more expensive than typical fertilizers.
Improved fertigation (combined fertilization‐irrigation systems) helps to reduce N leaching and
runoff. Precision application equipment can improve efficiency in tree based agriculture (citrus,
dates) by 30 percent. With regard to vegetable crops, because of the relatively low costs of
fertilizer compared to other farming costs, many farmers over apply N to avoid the possibility
of running out. Improved education and N management could reduce the need for N
application in some cases.

______________________________________________________________________________
The State should look for opportunities to implement additional nutrient management practices
for this policy in combination with the Best Management Farming Practices implemented for
Florida’s Total Maximum Daily Loadings (TMDL) Program. The TMDL program is concerned
with limiting nitrogen and other pollutants into lakes and other water bodies.
Improved Harvesting—
It was decided by the Action Team that the differences in harvesting methods between crops
was too large to quantify as one item. Instead, the state should investigate the potential for
energy savings through improved harvesting methods across all major crops. Then the state
should assess which crops are most attractive for investment when potential energy savings and
likely costs/ton.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
FDACS‐BMP cost‐share programs.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4, N2O: CO2 is indirectly sequestered from the atmosphere when soil carbon levels are
raised. Reductions of all three GHGs also occur through avoided use of fossil fuels during
tilling. Embedded GHGs associated with the production and transport of fertilizers are also
avoided when nutrient management programs achieve lower levels of nitrogen application.
Nutrient management also reduces N2O emissions that follow the application of nitrogen‐based
fertilizers.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Estimated GHG reductions (MMtCO2e/year): 0.7 and 1.2 in 2017 and 2025, respectively.
Estimated cost ($/tCO2e): –0.6
The estimates above are the sum of policy elements A and C (B and D were not quantified due to a lack of
data). Estimates for each policy element are provided below.
Data Sources: See Quantification Methods below.

Quantification Methods:
Soil Carbon
Total cropland in Florida was estimated at about 3.7 million acres57 in 2002. For the purposes of
this analysis, it is assumed that conservation practices include conservation till (no‐till and strip‐
till), and other conservation farming practices that provide enhanced ground cover, or other

______________________________________________________________________________
crop management practices that achieve similar soil carbon benefits. Conservation tillage is
defined as any system that leaves 50 percent or more of the soil covered with residue.58
Based on the policy design parameters, the schedule for acres to be put into conservation
tillage/no‐till cultivation is displayed in Table 5‐1. This table represents the percentage of
cropland required by the policy. The Florida data came from the Conservation Technology
Information Center’s National Crop Residue Management Surveys.59 This data indicated
that no‐till practices are not common in Florida, accounting for only a little over 55,000 acres
in 1998. If more recent figures for the number of no‐till acres in Florida could be found, that
would help improve the analysis.
Assume that this rate of accumulation occurs for 20 years which extends beyond the policy
period. It is assumed that the sequestration rate provided by the Chicago Climate Exchange for
the carbon credit program is reliable for the state of Florida. Also assume that while only some
of Florida is in Zone A (0.6 tCO2/acre/year), this is where the majority of no‐till practices are
likely to be adopted, so this figure is used for the state as a whole. 60
Additional GHG savings from reduced fossil fuel consumption are estimated by multiplying
the fossil diesel emission factor and diesel fuel reduction per acre estimate. The reduction in
fossil diesel fuel use from the adoption of conservation tillage methods is 3.5 gallons (gal)/acre.61
The life‐cycle fossil diesel GHG emission factor of 12.31 tCO2e/1,000 gal was used.62 Results are
shown in Table 5‐1, along with a total estimated benefit from both carbon sequestration and
fossil fuel reductions.

58 The definitions of tillage practices from the Conservation Technology Information Center are used under this
policy. However, only no‐till/strip‐till and ridge‐till are considered “conservation tillage” practices. No‐till means
leaving the residue from last year’s crop undisturbed until planting. Strip‐till means no more than one‐third of the
row width is disturbed with a coulter, residue manager, or specialized shank that creates a strip. If shanks are used,
nutrients may be injected at the same time. Ridge‐till means that 4–6‐inch‐high ridges are formed at cultivation.
Planters using specialized attachments scrape off the top 2 inches of the ridge before placing the seed in the ground.

The reduction in fossil diesel fuel use from the adoption of conservation tillage methods is 3.5
gallons/acre.63
The costs of adopting soil management practices (e.g., conservation tillage/no‐till practices) are
based on cost estimates from the Minnesota Agriculture Best Management Practices program.64
This program provides farmers a low‐interest loan as an incentive to initiate or improve their
current tillage practices. The equipment funded is generally specialized tillage or planting
implements that leave crop residues covering at least 15 to 30 percent of the ground after
planting. The average total cost for this equipment is $23,000, though the average loan for tillage
equipment is $16,000. The average‐size farm using an agricultural BMP loan to purchase
conservation tillage equipment is 984 acres. The average loan size was determined based on the

Nutrient Efficiency
The GHG benefits of this recommendation are quantified by calculating the CO2e emissions per
kilogram (kg) of nitrogen (N) applied in Florida. This uses an estimate of the nitrogen emissions
from fertilizer (4.77 kg CO2e per kg of N applied), calculated from the Florida I & F. This is then
combined with a figure for the life‐cycle emissions of nitrogen fertilizer to account for the rest of
the emissions associated with fertilizer manufacturing, transport, and application (0.857 kg
CO2e/kg of N).67 Thus, the total CO2e emissions in Florida are 5.62 kg CO2e/kg of N applied. The
BAU estimate of nitrogen fertilizer use in the Inventory and Forecast assumes constant rates of
nitrogen application from 2005. To increase nutrient efficiency by 25 percent, nitrogen fertilizer
use is then reduced from the BAU estimate. This reduction of nitrogen application is then
multiplied by the nitrogen emissions factor to determine the GHG benefits of this policy. Table
5‐5 presents the nitrogen reductions and the GHG benefits of the proposed nutrient efficiency
policy.

The costs of the nutrient efficiency policy were estimated based on the implementation of a soil
testing policy to optimize fertilizer application. This policy assumes $20 cost to test a 75 acre
field, with the field tested every five years, across all of Florida. There are also staffing costs for
the testing and information program ($250,000/year) and costs of preparing a guidance
document ($75,000). In addition to the costs of a program aimed at improved fertilizer
efficiency, the costs of using slow release fertilizers were also calculated. According to a study
on the Florida citrus industry, slow release fertilizers can improve nitrogen efficiency. The study
found that because plants have better uptake of N from controlled release fertilizers, overall N
application can be reduced by 50 percent.68 However, these controlled release fertilizers cost
approximately 3.37 times as much as conventional fertilizers, and therefore are not cost
effective, even with the efficiency improvement over conventional fertilizers.69 This analysis
considers the additional cost of controlled release fertilizers as a way of demonstrating the
likely costs of improving overall Nitrogen efficiency. While not all of the nitrogen efficiency
improvement will come from the use of controlled efficiency fertilizers, this analysis assumes
that other efficiency improvements (center pivot applicators, soil amendments to reduce
leaching, etc) will have similar costs. Subtracted from these costs are the savings from reduced
fertilizer use. See Table 5‐6 for more details.

Improved Harvesting Methods
This policy element was approved as non‐quantified recommendation. A baseline study is
needed to identify applicable improved harvesting methods for Florida’s primary crops, their
potential for adoption, their potential for energy and GHG reductions, and their costs.

Key Assumptions:
Nutrient Efficiency—Assumes that the costs of improved nutrient efficiency are comparable to
the additional costs of slow release fertilizers. In addition, it is assumes that improved nutrient
management practices can reduce the over N application without having a negative impact on
crop yield.
Soil Carbon Management—Assumes that the effective use of no‐till can be applied in Florida
without an adverse impact on crop yield.

D‐91
Appendix D

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
It is also assumed that no‐till practices can be implemented without an increase in nutrient
application. This can depend on the type of crop in which no‐till is implemented, but some no‐
till practices may require increased nutrient application.
Assumes that the land being used for no‐till will not be changed back to conventional or other
uses in the near future. Future land use change away from no‐till practices could result in a
decrease in soil carbon levels.

Key Uncertainties
Increasing labor costs and uncertain future labor supply may make harvesting more energy
intensive rather than less energy intensive as farmers replace human labor with mechanized
harvesting methods.
As mentioned under Quantification Methods above, baseline studies are needed to address the
GHG reduction potential and costs for the policy elements for Land Use Management that
Promotes Permanent Cover (on marginal agricultural lands) and Improved Harvesting
Methods. The Action Team encourages the FL Energy and Climate Commission to continue
study of these elements.

Additional Benefits, Costs and Energy Security Fuel Savings
Soil Carbon Management – the quantification described above estimated annual fuel savings of
about five million gallons of diesel fuel by 2025.
Nutrient Management ‐ Reduced nutrient application may have additional benefits in terms of
local water quality. The nutrient efficiency practices implemented under this policy directly tie
into Best Management Farming Practices implemented as part of the State’s Total Maximum
Daily Loading program.

Feasibility Issues

AFW-6. Reduce the Rate of Conversion of Agricultural Land and Open Green
Space to Development

Policy Description
Reduce the rate at which agricultural lands and open green space are converted to developed
uses, while protecting private property rights and responsibilities. This retains the above‐ and
belowground carbon on these lands, as well as their carbon sequestration potential.
Transportation emissions will be reduced indirectly through more efficient development and
lower vehicle use. Agricultural land and open green space conversion may be prevented
through fee title acquisitions or conservation easements.

Policy Design
Goals: By 2015, achieve a 15 percent reduction in the level of losses that would have otherwise
occurred. By 2025, achieve a 50 percent reduction in the level of losses that would have
otherwise occurred.
Timing: Achieve the goal throughout the policy period.
Parties Involved: FDACS; USDA, DEP, FWC, DCA; water management districts, and
nongovernmental organizations.
Other: Existing and estimated future agricultural and forested land loss is shown in the FDCAS
presentation available at: http://www.dca.state.fl.us/fdcp/dcp/gmw/2008/Scott.pdf.

Implementation Mechanisms
Preserve working lands.
Implement net preservation of “one acre saved per one acre converted.”
Educate general public and landowners to protect lands rather than sell them for development.
Carbon impacts need to be considered as part of the planning process in land use development.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
A number of programs already exist under Florida Law that provide incentives for the
preservation of conservation, agricultural lands and open space. First, Florida has an aggressive
natural lands acquisition program, the Florida Forever program, which has spent close to
$2 billion and has acquired more than 535, 643 acres of natural lands since July of 2001. The
program authorizes the issuance of bonds to fund land acquisition and is funded at the level of
$300 million each fiscal year. In 2008, the Legislature allocated a percentage of the revenue
available for land acquisition, approximately $10 million, to fund the purchase of permanent
D‐93
Appendix D

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
agricultural easements under the Rural and Family Lands Act, s. 570.71, Florida Statutes. In
addition to programs providing funding for the purchase of fee or easements over conservation
and agricultural lands, several land use planning tools are available that provide incentives for
placing agricultural and conservation lands under protective easements. The Rural Lands
Stewardship Program set forth in § 163.3177(11), Florida Statutes, provides for the adoption of a
comprehensive plan amendment creating a rural land stewardship area and providing for the
transfer of credits from agricultural and conservation areas to receiving areas designated for
development. The land from which the credits are transferred must be placed under an
agricultural or conservation easement running with the land in favor of the county where the
land is located and in favor of one of the following entities: DEP, DACS, a water management
district, or a recognized statewide land trust.
In addition to the tools listed above, a proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot on
November 4, 2008, Amendment 4, provides for a property tax exemption of perpetually
conserved land as well as authorizing the Florida Legislature to create a tax assessment category
for land used for conservation purposes that is not perpetually encumbered. The goal of these
provisions is to provide landowners with an incentive to maintain their land for a conservation
purpose rather than converting the land to development.
The Florida Rural and Family Lands Protection Act was passed in 2001 with the goal of
reducing the conversion of agricultural land to urban use. An important part of this act was the
Rural and Family Lands Protection Program (RFLPP). Funding for the RFLPP was provided
during the 2008 legislative session as part of the re‐authorization of the Florida Forever
Program. The RFLPP focuses on maintaining the integrity and function of working agricultural
landscapes and ensuring opportunities for viable agricultural activities on working agricultural
lands. RFLPP will focus on acquiring development rights using permanent easements from
qualified and willing agricultural land owners. This program, through permanent easement
acquisitions, will protect agricultural lands in the path of development so that Florida will
continue to maintain a viable agricultural sector as part of the State’s economy, while allowing
its citizens the opportunity to continue to enjoy rural landscapes and open space.
Information on the RFLPP came from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Community
Services, Division of Forestry, at: http://www.fl‐dof.com/forest_management/rural_
family_lands_index.html Accessed on August 27, 2008.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Preventing release of carbon from conversion of forests, wetlands, and agricultural lands
to development. Maintain annual carbon sequestration from forest growth, thriving wetlands
and productive agricultural lands. Reduce urban sprawl thus avoiding additional emissions
from vehicle miles traveled.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Estimated GHG reductions (MMtCO2e): 0.23 in 2017 and 0.53 in 2025.
Estimated cost ($/tCO2e): $93.
Data Sources: as specified under Quantification Methods below.

Quantification Methods:
Studies are lacking on the changes in below and above‐ground carbon stocks when agricultural
land is converted to developed uses. For some land use changes, carbon stocks could be higher
in the developed use relative to the agricultural use (for example, parks). In other instances,
carbon stocks are likely to be lower (graded and paved surfaces). CCS assumed that the
agricultural land would be developed into typical tract‐style suburban development. It was
further assumed that 50 percent of the land would be graded and covered with roads,
driveways, parking lots, and building pads. The final assumption was that 75 percent of the soil
carbon in the top eight inches of soil for these graded and covered surfaces would be lost and
not replaced. CCS also assumed no change in the levels of above‐ground carbon stocks.
The benefit in each year was determined by:

•

Estimating the amount of land protected in each year by estimating the annual rate of
agricultural land lost (70,820 acres/year, determined from NRI Florida data70) and assuming
that agricultural land is protected at an increasing rate up to 2025, where it is assumed that
net loss of agricultural land is reduced 50 percent.

•

Multiplying the soil carbon content (assumed to be 0.011 MMtC/1,000 acres71) on the
protected land by 50 percent (representing graded and covered areas) and by 75 percent
(fraction of soil carbon lost);

•

Converting the soil carbon lost to CO2 by multiplying by 44/12.

The GHG benefits are indicated in Table 4‐1. Note that the GHG benefits only include changes
to below ground soil carbon and the quantification does not include emissions caused by
activities associated with the various land uses (for example, emissions from tractor activities on
agriculture land or urban vehicle activity on developed land).

70 The most recent NRI data available at the detailed state level is for 1982 to 1997. It is expected that data up to 2003
will be available later in 2008.

Based on Personal Communication with Kevin Robertson on 8/28/08, who provided studies of Florida’s
agricultural soil C levels. Florida soil carbon levels ranged from 22 to 32 metric tons C per hectare in the first thirty
centimeters of the soil, which averaged to be a soil carbon level of .011 MMtC/1,000 acres.

Agriculture Lands Cost
To estimate program costs in each year, the estimated agricultural acres protected from
development were multiplied by the conservation cost. The conservation costs were assumed
based on the average easement acquisition cost per acre from the USDA ($4,935/acre). This cost
of conservation is assumed to remain constant across the policy period. It is further assumed
that subsidies are available through the FRPP72 for a 50 percent cost‐share. The resulting cost
effectiveness is $60/MtCO2e. This estimate only accounts for the direct reductions associated
with soil carbon losses estimated above and does not include potentially much larger indirect
benefits associated with reductions in vehicle miles traveled. The GHG benefits and program
costs are summarized in Table 4‐1.

Key Assumptions:
The rate of agricultural land conversion is a key assumption. Also, the analysis assumes that
while some urban land use recommendations (such as parks) may have higher sequestration
than agricultural use, overall sequestration is lower in urban rather than agricultural land use.

Key Uncertainties
Additional study of the benefits of this recommendation could provide a clearer picture of
potential benefits and costs. The rate of agricultural land conversion is a key issue. Action Team
members noted that a recent UF geographic information system study on land conversion by
2050 could help to gain additional understanding of this issue.

Additional Benefits, Costs and Energy Security Fuel Savings
Reducing agricultural land conversion can encourage densification of urban development,
which can have benefits in terms of reduced vehicle miles traveled. Hence, this
recommendation has direct implementation ties to smart development policy in the
Transportation and Land Use sector.

AFW-7. In-State Liquid/Gaseous Biofuels Production

Policy Description
Increase production of ethanol, bio‐diesel, and transportation fuel (compressed natural gas)
from agriculture, forestry feedstocks or MSW and other waste (raw materials) to displace the
use of fossil fuel. Promote the development of technologies and production systems that use
MSW biomass to produce liquid or gaseous biofuels, and the use of biomass in conjunction with
other resources to produce ethanol. Bio‐diesel and compressed natural gas use will offset fuel
derived from petroleum and will lead to decreased fossil fuel‐based CO2 emissions. Provide
market incentives to develop biofuels technologies from the multiple feedstocks.
Note that this recommendation is linked to the TLU Low‐Carbon Fuel Standards recommendation. This
recommendation focuses on in‐state production of biofuels.

Policy Design
Goals:
Primary: Maximize the production of liquid and gaseous biofuels in Florida, such that by 2025
the state utilizes 20 percent of available biomass supply per year to produce biofuels with
significantly lower embedded GHG emissions compared with conventional fuel products.
Secondary: Produce enough in‐state biofuel to offset 25 percent of Florida’s consumption of
liquid fuels that are fossil fuel‐based by 2025, using GHG‐superior feedstocks. Replace two
percent of petro‐diesel with biofuel by 2012 and 10 percent of gasoline with ethanol by 2010.
Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Municipal and county governments, private solid waste management
companies, local economic development agencies, Florida Department of Environmental
Protection, Florida Energy Commission, nongovernmental organizations, public interest
groups, and Public Service Commission.
Other: Primary and secondary goals are to be achieved. However, some revision to either goal
might be needed after some initial analysis of feedstock availability and the quantities of
biofuels necessary to offset forecast consumption.

Consider the following feedstock sources:
•

Long‐Rotation Forests—Need to promote the use of wood for liquid biofuels in Florida by
providing subsidies, tax credits, or payment schemes that enable landowners to conduct
proper thinning and removals that benefit the health of the forest and decrease the chances
of catastrophic wild fire. Promote the development of biomass utilizing facilities in

D‐98

______________________________________________________________________________
appropriate locations that contain sufficient biomass, but don’t already contain commercial
conversion facilities, by providing infrastructure needed to support the development and
transport of woody biomass. Promote development and deployment of advanced forest
management practices (for example, faster growing genetic stock with improved wood
properties for conversion to electricity, steam, and heat) that sustainably increases yields of
biomass across the rotation.

•

Short‐Rotation Forests—Need to promote the development and commercial deployment of
select and dedicated‐forest tree species in Florida by providing the following possibilities:
(1) establish guarantees or give subsidies for converting land near enough to facilities to
short rotation forests, offering low cost loans to first time growers (to help overcome initial
lack of cash flow); (2) landowner technical assistance programs; (3) promote stable and
efficient markets for wood and residues from short rotation forests by creation of incentives
for producing electricity, steam, and heat from this source of biomass; (4) create
opportunities for conversion facility owners to partner with existing landowners to establish
long‐term supply agreements; and (5) development equipment and methods that can
efficiently harvest and transport stems and residues to facilities that produce liquid biofuels.

•

Other Energy Crops—The state should not incur costs and impacts associated with invasive
plant species by encouraging, permitting, or incentivizing use of these species for carbon
feedstocks. Crops should have high yields with low to moderate inputs (perhaps even much
lower than the same crop grown as a food crop‐especially for fertilizer, pesticides, and
water), energy dense, high energy conversion, can be grown on poorer soils, etc. Peanut
(biodiesel) and sweet potato (ethanol) might fit this description.

•

MSW Biomass—Promote the use of MSW biomass for production of electricity by improving
the market value of through inclusion in a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Enhanced
revenue from electrical generation that will result from sales of credits in an RPS may
encourage the construction of new MSW biomass facilities as an alternative to landfilling,
and offset the production of methane (a more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2) that may
occur if the waste is disposed of in a landfill. As an indigenous and sustainable fuel, MSW
biomass can best be utilized by avoiding long‐distance transport of the material, and instead
developing appropriately sized local facilities to use this energy source. Local facilities also
assist in electrical reliability by providing distributed generating capacity.

•

Agriculture and Forestry Residues—Promote the use of forest residues by developing the
technical means and improving the financial returns that make use of these residues
commercially viable. Possibilities include: promoting research into harvesting, collection
and compaction for transportation, and subsidies to promote their use at conversion
facilities.

Overall, policies need to decrease the risk and uncertainties associated with having sustainable
supplies of good quality biomass at reasonable costs for the planned lifetime of the electrical,
heat, or steam producing facility. It is likely a wide array of policies will be needed that

influence land and conversion facility owners to dedicate themselves to using biomass
feedstocks to produce renewable power.
Utilization of liquid and gaseous biofuel plants in close proximity to energy crops will cause
reduction in the amount of energy required for feedstock transportation and fossil fuel use.
Combine technologies to enable ethanol production by utilizing cellulosic biomass extracted
from solid waste streams, and agricultural and forestry crops and residues.

Implementation Mechanisms
Links to demand‐side measure in the TLU low‐carbon fuel standard recommendation.
Provide grants or incentives to develop small‐scale biorefinery projects to convert woody
wastes to cellulosic ethanol or other fuels.
Provide grants or incentives to develop Florida‐based projects to convert landfill gas to
liquefied natural gas.
Pilot new technologies to process organic wastes from agriculture wastes and manure, food and
yard wastes, and industrial sludges to produce renewable fuels.
Provide incentives for the production of biomass.
Provide purchase guarantees for producers of biomass.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Currently some biofuel production facilities are already planned for Florida.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Lifecycle GHG emissions of advanced biofuels are lower than the lifecycle emissions of the
petroleum‐based fuels that they replace.

Quantification Methods:
Biofuel GHG Reductions
For ethanol the benefits for this recommendation are dependent on developing in‐state
production capacity that achieves benefits beyond petroleum fuels.
The incremental benefit of cellulosic ethanol produced from MSW biomass is equal to the
lifecycle CO2e emission factor of gasoline (11.30 t/1,000 gallons).73 The incremental benefit of
cellulosic production over gasoline from all other feedstocks targeted by this policy is 9.74
tCO2e reduced/1,000 gallons, based on the difference between the life cycle CO2e emission factor
of gasoline and the life cycle CO2e emission factor of cellulosic ethanol (1.51 t/1,000 gallons).74
The incremental benefit of starch‐based ethanol is 2.16 tCO2e reduced/1,000 gallons, based on
the difference between the life cycle CO2e emission factor of gasoline and the life cycle emission
factor of corn‐based ethanol (9.09 t/1,000 gallons).75 The incremental benefit of biodiesel is 8.11
tCO2e reduced/1,000 gallons, based on the difference between the life cycle CO2e emission factor
of diesel (11.3 t/1,000 gallons) and the life cycle emission factor of soy‐based biodiesel (0.667
t/1,000 gallons).76 Emission factors listed are based on the ANL GREET Model.77 The incremental
benefit values will be used along with the production in each year to estimate GHG reductions.
Annual cellulose production is multiplied by the estimated ethanol yield per ton biomass, based

on the projection that ethanol yield will increase from 70 gallons/ton biomass to 90 gallons/ton
biomass by 2012 and to 100 gallons/ton biomass by 2020.78
Table 7‐1 shows the number of 70‐million‐gallon/year cellulosic plants that will need to go
online in Florida to achieve the goal of using 20 percent of available biomass feedstock annually
by 2025, and summarizes the quantity of other biofuels that can be produced with the Florida
feedstock supply assuming that food crops will not be utilized for fuel. It is assumed that ramp‐
up in production of biofuels will not start until 2012. In Table 7‐1 the starch‐based ethanol
production is from excess citrus molasses and biodiesel production is from waste (yellow)
grease.79 The emissions reductions from this plan are calculated by multiplying the number of
gallons of ethanol or biodiesel produced in a given year by the emissions reduction per gallon.

Biofuel Costs
The cellulosic ethanol costs of this recommendation are estimated based on the capital and
operating costs of cellulosic ethanol production plants. A study by the National Renewable
Energy Laboratory estimated total capital costs for a 70 million gallon/year cellulosic ethanol
plant would be $200 million.80 An EIA study cited a major biofuels manufacturer who estimated
the costs of a first of its kind 50 million gallon/year cellulosic ethanol plant to be $375 million.81
An average of these costs was used in the estimate of capital costs. A new plant will need to be
built for every 70 million gallons of annual ethanol production needed based on this
assumption82. The annualized capital costs were estimated using a capital cost recovery factor
that assumed a 20 year lifetime for the plant and a seven percent interest rate. Operational and
maintenance costs were also taken from the NREL study.
The cost of biomass feedstocks made up a significant portion (approximately 60 percent) of
variable costs. Therefore, the NREL estimate of feedstock costs ($30/ton) was replaced with
more current estimates of the cost of delivered biomass: $70/ton for bunch grasses (such as
switchgrass) and $51/ton for agricultural residues, based on a recent publication from Purdue
University,83 $45/ton for forestry crops and residues,84 and a net revenue of $47/ton for MSW
biomass feedstock.85 The plant proposed by the NREL study produces some excess electricity,

Note that many recent planned cellulosic ethanol plants have been in the capacity range of 1 to 10 MMgal/year.

For bunch grasses (switchgrass), average product $52.23/ton. For agricultural residues (corn stover), average
product $33.41/ton. For each ton, assume transportation of 100 miles ‐ $15.00 for 50 miles + $3.00 for 50 marginal
miles, from “The Economics of Biomass Collection, Transportation, and Supply to Indiana Cellulosic and Electric

so the projected price of electricity from the Florida common assumptions document is used to
show the value of electricity sold to the grid by the plant. Another revenue source for the
ethanol plant is the value of the ethanol produced. The wholesale price of ethanol was taken

Key Assumptions: The most important assumption is the future wholesale price of ethanol.
When the price falls much below about $1.70/gallon, the current information on capital and
operating costs suggests that the cellulosic plants will not be profitable. The assumed capital
and operating costs for cellulosic ethanol plants are also key assumptions. Some of the newer
plants being constructed in the US are smaller (~10 MMgal/yr or less) than the assumed 70
MMgal/yr plants here. Finally, the costs of biomass feedstocks are also key input assumptions.
The operating costs for cellulosic plants assume the price of electricity to be sold is $0.04/kWh.

Key Uncertainties
Algae and jatropha may be able to serve as sustainable feedstocks for biodiesel production; it is
unknown how much of these feedstocks will be cultivated in Florida.
This recommendation’s costs are highly dependent on the price of feedstock, which for many
types of feedstock is still relatively unclear. If feedstock prices prove higher on a per ton basis
than currently estimated then this recommendation may had a net cost rather than a net
revenue.
This recommendation’s revenue is also highly dependent on the wholesale price of ethanol as
this is the primary source of revenue for biofuel production plants. The AEO 2008 predicts
ethanol wholesale prices under $2 for the next several years. Currently the state average rack

price for ethanol is $2.85 (as of July 31, 2008; see
http://www.ethanolmarket.com/fuelethanol.html). If future wholesale prices of ethanol stay in
that range, then this recommendation has the potential to have a higher net revenue.

million gallons diesel.

practices that minimize or reduce GHG emissions. These technologies include those that
improve fuel efficiency in the collection, transport, and disposal of solid waste, including
procurement of more fuel‐efficient vehicles, to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and
related CO2 emissions. Waste management technologies are needed that will enhance landfill
gas collection and production, such as bioreactor technology, to accelerate landfill gas
production and waste stabilization.
There is some level of overlap between this recommendation and the MSW landfill gas goal under AFW‐
4.

Policy Design
Goals: Decrease GHG emissions from cradle‐to‐grave (CTG) solid waste management practices
by 25 percent (collection, transportation and disposal) from BAU by 2025.
Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Local governments conducting solid waste collection and disposal, private
solid waste management companies, vehicle and equipment suppliers, fuel suppliers, state
regulatory agencies (DEP, PSC), federal agencies (US EPA), regulated electrical utilities, public
interest groups, and the public‐at‐large (rate‐paying public).
Other: A substantial component of the carbon footprint of solid waste management is the fuel
consumed in collecting and transporting waste. Because the amounts of fuel consumed are
significant from an economic standpoint, many public and private sector operations are already
trying to maximize their efficiency. Nevertheless, there may be opportunities to seek further
improvement, and because of the magnitude, even small improvements will yield substantial
reductions. Software providing modern computer‐aided routing may not be available to all
entities collecting waste, particularly local governments collecting waste with their own forces.
Creating a mechanism to assist those entities that do not have, and perhaps cannot afford,
routing software may yield benefits.
The fleets of solid waste collection vehicles are managed to maximize their operating hours, and
these vehicles may have a typical useful life of seven to 10 years. As vehicle and equipment
manufacturers develop more fuel‐efficient stock, it may be helpful to examine a program to
incentivize early replacement of vehicles with more fuel‐efficient models. An opportunity may

arise to do a life cycle and carbon footprint analysis of tax incentives for replacing older
collection vehicles with newer more efficient ones.
Smaller landfills, and landfills that closed prior to the regulatory requirements that mandated
the installation of collection systems for landfill gas, may still be creating impacts on GHG
levels through the uncontrolled release of landfill gas. The collection and management of this
landfill gas will be an environmental benefit, even if the quantities collected are not sufficient to
support a viable landfill gas to energy project. A combination of incentives that produce GHG‐
reduction credits for collecting and managing the gas at sites that would otherwise be exempt,
together with a review to determine if additional regulation is required, can quantify the costs
and benefits of collecting gas at these types of facilities.
A bioreactor landfill is essentially an in‐landfill activity conducted at a standard Subtitle D
sanitary landfill in which liquid, temperature, and air and landfill gas collection are managed in
a controlled manner to achieve a more rapid stabilization of the biogenic waste constituents
(food, greenwaste, and paper). A bioreactor landfill will produce more landfill gas over a
shorter period of time than a standard Subtitle D landfill. This may make the economic viability
of landfill gas to energy projects more attractive. To optimize the rapid waste stabilization of
these wastes, moisture, gas composition, gas flow, and temperature must be carefully
maintained and monitored.
Whether a landfill is managed as a standard Subtitle D landfill, or as a bioreactor, the efficiency
of landfill gas collection should be maximize to limit release of CH4 to the atmosphere. This
would include installing collection systems for landfill gas earlier than the time frames required
in current regulations, which stipulate installation after waste has been in place for five years.
Economic factors that make the production of energy from landfill gas attractive may be as
important in encouraging the maximum efficiency of collection systems as regulatory
requirements.

Implementation Mechanisms
Promote the use of enhanced routing analysis techniques to reduce the amount of fuel
consumed during waste collection and transport.
Encourage the accelerated replacement of collection and transport vehicles with more fuel
efficient vehicles.
Deploy enhanced landfill gas collection systems, including bioreactor technology, where
appropriate, to accelerate production of landfill gas generation and efficiency of collection at 50
percent of new or currently operating landfills by 2025.
Install landfill gas collection systems at uncontrolled landfills and/or closed municipal solid
waste landfills, to reduce the amount of uncontrolled release of methane from these facilities by
50 percent by 2020.

______________________________________________________________________________
The proposed cap‐and‐trade system for greenhouse gas emission will create incentives for more
efficient collection and utilization of landfill gas.
The establishment of Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) for the generation of electricity from
landfill gas, combined with a Renewable Portfolio Standard will add more value to the power
generated by landfill gas and make more projects economically viable.
Tax incentives for the replacement of older vehicles with newer more fuel efficient ones could
be developed based on life cycle benefits and carbon footprint impacts.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Existing regulations require the collection of landfill gas, testing the efficiency of collection
systems, and reporting quantities of gas collected to DEP. It may take some modification to
existing Subtitle D landfill regulations to effectively implement bioreactor technology.
Existing regulatory programs for small and closed landfills may help identify sites that have
potential for reducing GHG emissions by installing landfill gas collection systems.
DEP and the UF Hinkley Center for Solid and Hazardous Waste Management are currently
funding three bioreactor demonstration projects in Florida (see www.bioreactor.org).

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, CH4, and N2O: Emissions reduced from increased collection and transport efficiency.
These emissions are a result of a reduction in the amount of diesel fuel needed to collect and
transport MSW. CH4 may also be reduced by improved landfill gas collection efforts and the
application of bioreactor technologies.

Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Estimated GHG reductions (MMtCO2e): 1.9 in 2017 and 4.4 in 2025.
Estimated cost effectiveness: $9/tCO2e.

Quantification Methods:
GHG Benefit
The baseline cradle‐to‐grave emissions from the waste management sector were estimated by
multiplying the tons of waste managed by the emission factors in Table 8‐1. These factors were
based on information provided by the Palm Beach County Solid Waste Administration and
Waste Management, Inc.89
The MSW collection emission factor is based on the number of gallons consumed by curbside
collection vehicles for a service area in North Florida with a population of 534,359.90 Based on
the resulting fuel consumption of 2.3 gallons/person/year and the 2008 projected FL population
from the Florida Inventory and Forecast (FL I&F), CCS computed the 2008 fuel use by collection
vehicles to be about 43 million gallons. This number, divided by the 2008 projected waste
generation (see discussion for Table 8‐2, below) and multiplied by the life‐cycle diesel emission
factor of 0.01125 tCO2e/gallon, yields the emission factor of 0.0123 tCO2/ton MSW.
The MSW transport emission factor represents emissions due to the transportation of waste
from transfer facilities to landfills. The Solid Waste Authority of Palm Beach County (SWA)
submitted data that show a miles‐travelled‐per‐ton ratio of 2.15 miles/ton for waste transferred.
SWA also estimates a fuel efficiency of 4.5 miles per gallon for transfer vehicles. Based on the
these numbers and the life‐cycle diesel emission factor of 0.01125 tCO2e/gallon, the MSW
transport emission factor is estimated to be 0.00538tCO2e/ton MSW. DEP estimates that about
18,250,000 tons MSW is processed on transfer stations annually (based on 50,000 tons per day).91
The emission factor is multiplied by the tons expected to be processed at transfer stations to
yield the expected annual MSW transport emissions.
SWA reports that heavy equipment used at transfer stations are responsible for the emission of
2.17 lb CO2e for each ton of waste processed at these facilities.92 This converts to 0.000986
tCO2e/ton MSW processed at transfer facilities.

Waste Management, Inc. provided CCS with a range of 0.26 to 0.45 gallons of fuel used per ton
of waste deposited at landfills.93 Multiplying the midpoint of this range by the life‐cycle diesel
emission factor of 0.01125 tCO2e/gallon yields a heavy equipment (landfills) emission factor of
0.00399 tCO2e/ton MSW.

These factors were multiplied by the number of tons projected to be managed in the state of

any policy implementation would begin in 2010. The historic emissions from landfills were
taken from the Waste Management Appendix of the Florida Emissions Inventory and Forecast.
The amount of solid waste disposed (landfilled and incinerated) was projected through the end
of the policy period in 2025 using the average annual growth rate of from 2001‐2006 DEP waste
generation data.95 Table 8‐2 displays the estimated waste management sector emissions.

The GHG reduction potential from the policy goal of 25 percent cradle to grave emissions
reduction is shown in Table 8‐3. The emission reduction is relative to the BAU scenario shown
in Table 8‐2. The following suite of strategies may be utilized to achieve the 25 percent emission
reduction goal: additional active gas collection efficiency at LFGTE sites, optimized collection
routes, trucks fueled by biodiesel, liquefied natural gas (LNG) or liquefied LFG, or the
installation of microturbines at smaller landfill sites. Bioreactors (anaerobic), suited for use at
larger sites, re‐circulate leachate within a landfill to increase the rate of methane generation and
the potential for enhanced collection over conventional landfills. However, while bioreactor
projects produce more methane in the short‐run, they tend to have a steep decline in production
after most of the waste has been digested.96 As cost and GHG benefit information on bioreactors
was not available to CCS at the time this document was written, bioreactors were not assumed
to be a mitigation technology. The GHG reductions and costs for each strategy/technology will
be discussed in the remainder of this section. Note that the implementation of these strategies
and technologies are assumed for modeling purposes. This model has been prepared by CCS
with input from the TWG and is by no means intended to be strictly prescriptive of the manner
in which the goal for AFW‐8 may be reached. The level to which each is assumed to be
implemented is presented in the Cost‐Effectiveness section, below.

Cost‐Effectiveness
As mentioned above, four potential waste management emission reduction strategies are
considered for the quantification of this goal. The four strategies are:
1. Additional Active Gas Recovery
2. Route Adjustment
3. Alternative Fuels/Hybrid Technology
4. Microturbines
This list of strategies is not intended to be comprehensive or prescriptive, nor is the timing and
rate at which each strategy is applied. This cost quantification represents a rough estimate of the
potential cost of implementing this goal. Therefore, the cost‐effectiveness of each strategy has
also been presented individually. Individually, the implementation of these strategies, are not
projected to reach the CTG emission reduction goal of 25 percent. Therefore, these strategies are
D‐115

______________________________________________________________________________
assumed to be implemented in the order listed above, with the remainder of the emission
reduction goal carrying over to the next strategy until the goal has been met.

Additional Active Gas Recovery
One of the goals of AFW‐4 was to control 50% of landfill emissions for energy utilization by
2025. It is assumed that all landfill gas (LFG) collection systems currently in place will achieve
75 percent collection efficiency, while LFG collection systems installed as a result of the
implementation of AFW‐4 will achieve 85 percent efficiency. Through the Additional Active Gas
Recovery strategy, CCS assumes that all landfills with active gas collection (both currently and
under full AFW‐4 implementation) will achieve a 90 percent collection efficiency. Emissions will
be reduced not only from the additional capture of LFG and the conversion of the methane in
the LFG to CO2, but the additional energy that may be generated through the additional
collection. Table 8‐4 displays the GHG reduction from Additional Active Gas Recovery. This
strategy is projected to meet the AFW‐8 targets through 2015.

The capital cost for Additional Active Gas Recovery is estimated to be $400,000 per site.97 Utilizing
information from the FL I&F, CCS determined that this strategy would likely apply to 31 sites.
The annualized cost of this capital is $1.8 million per year. The value of the utilized energy is
consistent with the value used in AFW‐4: $0.045 per kWh and $4.50 per MMBtu of direct
energy. Table 8‐5 displays the total annualized cost quantification. The cost‐effectivness of this
strategy is estimated to be a savings of ‐$1/tCO2e.

Route Adjustment
CCS estimated that a reasonable target for fuel consumption reduction through collection route
adjustment would be 15 percent. This reduction potential is inferred from an EPA publication
that outlines route adjustment successes from the 1990’s.98 Table 8‐6 shows the projected

of a range of estimated costs of $300,000–$500,000 per site.

Another EPA publication cited the start‐up costs for a route‐optimization program in Charlotte,
NC to be $75,000.99 The population of Charlotte, North Carolina, in 2008 was estimated to be
540,828.100 Averaging this cost out across the 2008 projected population of Florida and
annualizing the cost over the policy period yields an average annual cost of $400,000. The
annual fuel savings is determined by using the life cycle diesel emission factor to determine the
fuel savings from the GHG benefit of this strategy, then multiplying this fuel savings by the
estimated diesel fuel cost. This cost is assumed to be $4.00/gallon101 This cost is intentionally

Alternative Fuels/Hybrid Technology
The two elements to this strategy are to turn over the existing fleet of garbage trucks to hybrid
trucks and utilize B20 biodiesel fuel, which can be substituted for diesel without engine
upgrades.102 The fleet is expected to turnover at 20 percent per year until all trucks are
hybrids.103 The fuel savings for hybrid vehicles is assumed to be 40 percent. The lower emission

reduction from Hybrid trucks in the years 2015 through 2020 shown in Table 8‐8 are indicative
of the time it takes for the fleet to turn over.
The emission savings realized by the switch to hybrid trucks was subtracted from the total
liquid fuel emissions in each year. From this result, the 17.6 percent GHG benefit realized from
the switch to B20 is applied to yield the GHG benefit from the Alternative Fuels/Hybrid
Technology strategy. The B20 emission benefit is adjusted for the differences in heat content
between biodiesel and fossil diesel. The diesel heat content is 0.139 MMBtu/gallon and the
biodiesel heat content is 0.129 MMBtu/gallon.104 The B20 life cycle emission factor (9,133
tCO2e/MMgal) is based on the soy biodiesel life cycle emission factor (667 tCO2e/MMgal) and
the low‐sulfur diesel life cycle emission factor (11,250 tCO2e/MMgal) used in AFW‐7. The GHG
benefit from this strategy is shown in Table 8‐8.

The Vehicle Inventory and Use Survey states that there were 4,000 garbage trucks in FL in
2002.105 Based on this figure, there were 86.5 tCO2e/truck/year in 2002, meaning that for each
hybrid truck substituted for a conventional truck, 34.6 tCO2e/year are avoided. CCS divided the
total benefit from hybrid substitution by the 34.6tCO2e benefit to yield the total number of
hybrid trucks needed to achieve that benefit. The number of trucks purchased in each year is
multiplied by the assumed $160,000 cost premium.106 The cost of these trucks are annualized
over the remainder of the policy period. It is assumed that once the fleet has turned over to
hybrid technology, there is no incremental cost for hybrid garbage trucks.
The B20 cost premium is estimated to be $0.20/gallon.107 The number of gallons needed was
found by dividing the total GHG benefit by the B20 life cycle emission factor of 9,133
tCO2e/MMgal. The resulting estimated cost‐effectiveness of this strategy is $128/tCO2e (Table 8‐

Microturbines
CCS assumed that microturbines (small engines capable of economically producing electricity
at smaller sites) would make up the remainder of the CTG emission reduction goal set forth in
this recommendation [note that other landfill gas utilization methods are also potentially
applicable here including direct use and small engine/generator sets that would achieve GHG
reductions at lower cost. CCS selected microturbines as the energy utilization technology to
provide a more conservative (high) estimate of potential costs]. CCS consulted the FL I&F to
ensure that there was sufficient landfill gas that was not already controlled or projected to be
controlled under AFW‐4. This was accomplished by taking the difference of the projected
uncontrolled landfill emissions for each year and the uncontrolled landfill emissions assumed to
be captured in the future as a result of the implementation of AFW‐4. Table 8‐10 displays the
assumed GHG benefit from the adoption of microturbines.

Key Assumptions: See text above. A key assumption affecting quantification is the timing of the
implementation of the four strategies to meet this goal. Other strategies may be used to meet the
goal that may have different cost implications.

Key Uncertainties
The strategies assumed to be implemented to meet the goal of AFW‐8 may or may not be the
most cost‐effective CTG emission reduction strategies. Therefore, as this is recommendation
requires a suite of mitigation strategies, regulation (if included as an implementation
mechanism) and market forces would dictate the actual manner in which this goal would be
implemented.
A plausible technology that may be implemented to decrease net emissions from CTG waste
management would be bioreactors at landfill sites. Bioreactors (anaerobic) re‐circulate leachate
within a landfill to increase the rate of methane generation and the potential for enhanced
collection over conventional landfills. However, while bioreactor projects produce more

AFW-9. Improved Commercialization of Biomass to Energy Conversion
and Bio-Products Technologies

Policy Description
Improved commercialization of biomass to energy conversion and bio‐products technologies in
this recommendation include the following four elements:

•

Manure digestion/other waste energy utilization,

•

Wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) biosolids energy production,

•

Other biomass conversion technologies, and

•

Bio‐products technologies and use.

The CH4 emissions inherent from the anaerobic decomposition process of manure and other
wastes may be captured and used as an energy source. In so doing, it is possible to both reduce
CH4 emissions and to offset fossil‐based energy. However, the cost of emission capture and
energy production may be higher than the value of the energy collected, making this
recommendation cost prohibitive for producers operating in a tight margin business. This
recommendation covers programs to increase the number of CH4 capture and energy recovery
projects using manure or other waste. CH4 digesters could be on‐farm or a regional‐type
digester could be employed.
Develop and implement methods for WWTP biosolids processing and use as a renewable
energy and nutrient source, including but not limited to, co‐firing with other fuels in existing or
new combustion units for the purpose of generating electricity, heat, or steam, and application
of WWTP biosolids to agricultural soils.
Improve the rate of technology development and market deployment of biomass and MSW
conversion technologies, including biomass gasification combined cycle (BGCC) electricity
generation, pyrolysis, and plasma arc technologies.
Increase the amount of renewable products and chemicals produced and used (including
building materials that reduce GHG emissions) over conventional petroleum‐based products.
Promote the use of crop residues and MSW as a source of material for reuse (e.g., in building
materials, packaging, or other materials).

Policy Design
Goals:
•

A. Utilize 20 percent of available CH4 from livestock manure for energy production by
2025.110

•

B. Maintain the current level of available WWTP solids used for soil application. Explore
potential for WWTP bio‐solids and other organic wastes111 as feedstock for energy or
fertilizer production. Utilize 50 percent of available biomass and MSW as energy sources
(after accounting for biomass needs under AFW‐4 and AFW‐7) by 2025.112 Develop
emerging technologies, including BGCC, pyrolysis, and plasma arc, for more efficiency by
2025.

•

C. Annually produce and utilize 150,000 tons of bio‐based products by 2025.

Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Livestock producers, FFB, Sunbelt Milk Producers, Florida Cattlemen’s
Association (FCA), Florida Electric Cooperatives Association (FECA), UF IFAS, FDACS, DEP,
and USDA‐NRCS, food processors, other livestock organizations (for example, FL
Thoroughbred Breeders & Owners Association).
Other: It should be noted that CH4 digesters are a proven technology, but Florida does present
some specific challenges. Also any digester that would be constructed must ultimately be
managed, which could cause an additional burden on livestock producers without the proper
assistance.
A range of renewable products can be developed from these biomass conversion processes,
including gaseous and liquid fuels, biochar, chemical products, and CH4 to methanol. Existing
processes include waste combustion and energy recovery (as electricity, steam, or both) or
ethanol plants using co‐products for heating and drying, rather than relying on outside energy
sources.
Improve the utilization and development of bio‐products for insulation and packaging material.
Significant increase of bio‐product technology is to be made available by 2017 for commercial,
industrial and residential use.
Increased development of emerging technologies will ultimately increase commercialization of
such technologies.
110

The quantification of benefits and costs for this option also assessed a goal of 50% utilization (see Quantification
Methods section).
111
Other organic wastes could include manure from beef cattle feedlots, horse operations (e.g. race tracks), food
processing facilities, etc.
112
An analysis of this aspect of the policy element was not performed, since AFW-4 and AFW-7 were estimated to
use a significant fraction of the State’s available biomass resources; however, the overall policy element was
approved as a non-quantified recommendation.

Implementation Mechanisms
Cap‐and‐Trade—This recommendation has links to Cap‐and‐Trade policy recommendations of
the Action Team Process. A Cap‐and‐Trade program may provide incentives for adoption of
improved organic waste management provided that appropriate offset programs are developed
as part of the program.
Research and Development programs are needed to identify centralized approaches for
management of the organic wastes covered by this recommendation, as well as specific waste
feedstocks. These centralized approaches can assure that sufficient economies of scale are
achieved to make digester or gasification projects economically sustainable. For gasification
projects, a variety of waste feedstocks are often needed in order to attain and maintain moisture
content into the gasifier.
Ensure biosolids application is safe and avoid watershed areas.
Educate public and local jurisdictions on potential utilization of WWTP biosolids.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
E.O. 07‐127 RPS request may create additional demand for methane digesters; further recent
rulemaking by the PSC would enable net‐metering for up to two megawatts (MW) in capacity
and standard interconnection for all distributed renewables, thus furthering the likelihood of
this technology.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CH4: methane is captured and typically combusted in an energy recovery system or flared.
Small amounts of N2O and CO2 are emitted from the combustion process.
CO2: carbon dioxide is reduced when the methane is converted to energy and that energy is
used to offset fossil‐based energy (e.g., coal‐fired electricity, natural gas, etc.). Small amounts of
N2O and CH4 are also reduced from the fossil‐based energy that is offset.
Also, displacement of coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels reduces emissions of fossil carbon.
Increased energy efficiency decreases the amount of carbon emitted per unit of economic
productivity. On‐farm capture or production of renewable energy reduces the need for
consumption of fossil energy, and displaces the associated fossil carbon emissions. Carbon is
sequestered in bioproducts. If these products later biodegrade, the carbon is from renewable
sources, so there is no net increase in atmospheric CO2.

Digestion Systems on U.S. Livestock Production Facilities, NRCS, Technical Note No. 1, October 2007.
Additional data sources are cited in the quantification methodology below.

Quantification Methods:
A. Manure Digesters
The quantification of the manure digester goal was limited to the control of methane/manure
from dairy and poultry farms, as information developed for the Florida I & F showed these
farms to account for 88 percent of livestock manure emissions in 2025. As electricity generation
at dairy and poultry farms is executed through a different mechanism, the components will be
quantified separately.

GHG Benefits from Dairy Manure
Methane emissions (in MMtCO2e) data from the Florida Agriculture Inventory and Forecast
was used as the starting point to estimate the GHG benefits of capturing and controlling the
volumes of methane targeted by the policy. The available methane was also used to calculate
the additional benefit of electricity generation using this captured methane (through offsetting
fossil‐based generation). The first portion of GHG benefit was obtained through reduced
methane emissions through the capture of emissions from manure. An assumed collection
efficiency of 75 percent113 was applied to methane emissions from animal manure which was
then multiplied by the assumed policy target ramping up to achieve 20 percent collection by
2025.
The second portion of the GHG benefit is through the offsetting of fossil‐based electricity
generation. This was estimated by converting the captured methane in each year to its heat
content (in Btu) and then multiplying by an energy recovery factor of 17,100 Btu/kWh to
estimate the electricity produced (assumes a 25 percent efficiency for conversion to electricity in

The collection efficiency is an assumed value based on engineering judgment. No applicable studies were
identified that provided information on methane collection efficiencies achieved using manure digesters (as it relates
to collection of entire farm‐level emissions).

an engine and generator set). The CO2e associated with this amount of electricity in each year
was estimated by multiplying the megawatt hours (MWh) by the Florida‐specific emission
factor for electricity production from GHG Inventory and Forecast.
The total GHG benefit was estimated as the sum of both portions of the benefit described above
and indicated in Table 9‐1.

Costs for Dairy Manure
The costs for this component were estimated using an analysis by Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS), An Analysis of Energy Production Costs from Anaerobic Digestion
Systems on U.S. Livestock Production Facilities.114 The electricity production costs were assumed to
be $0.05 for dairy anaerobic digesters.115 The electricity production cost includes capital
expenses for the digester and generator. 116 The O&M cost for dairy farms is stated in the
aforementioned report to be $3.82 per 1000 kWh, or $0.00382/kWh. These costs are in 2006
dollars and assume a 30 percent thermal efficiency. The value of electricity produced was
assumed to be equal to the rate received by producers from the utilities. In many cases this is
lower than the retail rate. CCS used the same default rate of $0.045/kWh as used in AFW‐4
(LFGTE). This price is assumed to escalate at a rate of two percent per year. This price
represents the value to the farmer for the electricity produced (as an offset of on‐farm use) and
is netted out from the production costs to estimate net costs.

Beddoes, Bracmort, Burns and Lazarus. 2007. An Analysis of Energy Production Costs From Anaerobic Digestion
Systems on U.S. Livestock Production Facilities, NRCS, Technical Note No. 1, October 2007.
114

115 It was assumed that the technology employed for dairy anaerobic digesters was covered anaerobic lagoon. Cost
were obtained from table 1 of the NRCS paper sited above.

The economic analysis conducted for this publication does not include feedstock and digester effluent
transportation costs. The technical note does not address the economics of centralized digesters where biomass is
collected from several farms and then processed in a single unit.

GHG Benefits from Poultry Litter
For the poultry litter component, it was assumed that the use of poultry litter for energy
production at larger sites would occur through a combination of gasification and direct
combustion. The amount of available litter was taken from Flora and Riahi‐Nezhad (2006).117
The amount of poultry litter utilized is illustrated in Table 9‐3 and expressed in MMBtu.
The assumed energy content of poultry litter is 4,600 Btu/lb, and the assumed heat rate is 18,000
Btu/kWh.118 A capacity factor of 85% was assumed to approximate the installed electrical
capacity required at large facilities.

Costs for Poultry Litter
The cost of production of poultry litter as a feedstock was assumed to be $38/ton (or
$4.08/MMBtu, assuming 4,600 Btu/lb). This was based on an average between gasification and
combustion provided in Flora and Riahi‐Nezhad (2006), which provided a value of poultry
litter as a co‐firing feedstock and a gasification feedstock.
The assumed incremental capital costs are based on the capital costs associated with the
biomass component of a coal/biomass (poultry litter) co‐fired plant. A capital cost of $100/kW
was assumed, based on a pulverized coal plant co‐fired with three percent biomass.119 While use

of poultry litter may be pursued through other technology types (for example, gasification,
anaerobic digestion) or other end uses (for example, heat or steam), the capital costs of co‐firing
were used to provide an estimate of possible capital costs required to enable the utilization of
biomass.120 The life of the loan was assumed to be 15 years (covering the policy period for this
goal), and the interest rate was assumed to be five percent, giving a capital recovery factor of
0.096. For the purposes of this analysis, it is assumed that plants utilizing poultry litter do not
require additional O&M costs (e.g., no additional emission control measures and ash disposal
required).
The net cost of production was estimated by subtracting the price of electricity from the cost of
production, illustrated in Table 9‐4. The levelized cost‐effectiveness is a savings of ‐$25/tCO2e.

The capital costs associated with using biomass as an alternative to fossil‐based generation are dependent on many
factors, including the end use (i.e., electricity, heat, or steam), the design and size of the system, the technology
employed, and the configuration specifications of the system. Each system implemented under this policy would
require a detailed analysis (incorporating specific engineering design and costs aspects) to provide a more accurate
cost estimate of the system.

Analysis for the assessment of 50 percent capture of manure methane.
Based on Florida agricultural statistics from USDA, more than 80 percent of dairy cattle are at
operations with greater than 500 head, while only around 15 percent of swine are at operations
with greater than 500 head. Since such a large proportion of dairy cattle are in large animal
feeding operations (AFOs) suited for anaerobic digester technology, this recommendation was
also analyzed assuming a goal of 50 percent of methane captured and utilized by 2025. This
higher goal resulted in a cumulative emission reduction of 1.9 MMtCO2e by 2025 and a net
present value of –$33 million. The cost‐effectiveness was the same as the 20 percent goal (–
$17/tCO2e).

B. WWTP Solids, Biomass, and MSW Energy
The following analysis represents the combination of two goals under this proposed
recommendation: Utilize 50 percent of available biomass and MSW as energy sources and
maintain the current level of WWTP solids (biosolids) for land application (also open to include
other uses such as fertilizer substitute and energy utilization). These two goals were combined
as a result of research that showed the possibility of locating a biomass gasification electricity
generation plant near a WWTP for the purpose of co‐gasifying biosolids with other biomass and
generating electricity with the resulting biogas. Due to the high moisture content of biosolids,
the heat value for these materials is low, making it more beneficial to locate such a facility at or
near a WWTP. Biomass may also be gasified to ensure that the plant runs as close to capacity as
possible.
Biosolids gasification is an emerging technology. CCS is aware of two specific projects that have
been planned: MaxWest Energy (http://www.maxwestenergy.com) has a facility planned in
Sanford, Florida, and a site in Banning, California, called “Liberty XXIII”
(http://www.liberty23.com/). Although this is likely not a comprehensive list, these are the two
projects of which CCS has been made aware. The Liberty XXIII facility will gasify both WWTP
biosolids and biomass. An Environmental Impact Statement (EIS),121 as well as an Economic
Impact Report,122 has been completed and posted on the Web for the Liberty XXIII project, and
therefore will serve as a case study for this analysis. According to Summary of Class AA
Residuals: 2007 from Florida DEP,123 about 83 percent of wastewater residuals are either
distributed and marketed as Class AA residuals products to be used as soil amendment or
directly land applied as Class A or Class B residuals. This same document provides the total
amount of Class AA residuals marketed in 2007 to be 197,426 dry tons. The Domestic Wastewater
Residuals Fact Sheet for Florida’s Farmers and Ranchers from Florida DEP states that 66 percent of
all biosolids are applied to land as Class B residuals (CCS is assuming that Class A and Class B
make up this 66 percent).124
Using the information above, CCS estimated the total quantity of Class B WWTP solids that are
land‐applied to be 766,477 dry tons. Based on communication with DEP, CCS assumed that all
Class B solids will need to find an alternative disposal method to land application by 2025. For
the purposes of quantifying this recommendation, the quantity of Class B solids currently land‐

applied are assumed to be gasified for energy generation in 2025 (it is recognized that there
could be other least cost methods for Class B solids management and that it isn’t assured that
Class B application will be banned post‐2025).
Not counting the demand for poultry litter in AFW‐9, CCS assumed that 50 percent of the
remaining biomass in 2025 would be utilized via co‐gasification with WWTP biosolids. The
quantity of biomass that would be utilized under this goal, based on the biomass supply table at
the beginning of this document, is 15,175,709 tons.

GHG Benefit from WWTP Solids, Biomass, and MSW Energy
According to the Liberty XXIII EIS, the heat value for biomass is 5,390 Btu/lb, while the heat
value for biosolids is 1,550 Btu/lb. The combined heat rate is calculated in the EIS to be 30,722
Btu/kWh, after the assumed 85 percent capacity factor is applied. The EIS for the Liberty XXIII
project also provides a detailed GHG benefit analysis. Based on the results of that analysis, the
GHG benefit from the facility is inferred to be 0.29 tCO2e/MWh. This benefit includes reduced
transportation costs, reduced composting and landfilling emissions, as well as anthropogenic
emission increases due to the release of N20 during the gasification and combustion process.
The emission benefit from avoided electricity is determined by multiplying the annual
electricity generation by the projected Florida electricity generation emission factor (derived
from the FL I&F). Table 9‐6 displays the results of the GHG benefit analysis. The gasification of
the quantities of biomass and biosolids stated above (including a linear ramp‐up from zero in
2009 to full implementation in 2025), yields a cumulative GHG benefit of 41.7 MMtCO2e.

Costs for WWTP Solids, Biomass, and MSW Energy
The combined capital cost over the first four years of the Liberty XXIII project totals $126.8
million. Assuming a five percent interest rate, 15‐year loan period, a 85 percent capacity factor
and a 15 MW installed capacity, the annual capital cost per MWh is $109/kWh. The annual
O&M cost per kWh is $9.125 Based on the annual increase in O&M expenditures estimated by
Liberty Energy, CCS assumes an O&M escalator of 4.5%. Applying these cost parameters to the
projections in Table 9‐6 yields a cost‐effectiveness of $44/tCO2e (see Table 9‐7).

includes production of product materials, including extraction of raw materials through
production of resin; transportation of product resins to fabrication; fabrication of products from
resins, and postconsumer disposal of products, including landfill and combustion of mixed
MSW. Recycling and composting were not considered as part of the AII LCA. Of the products
analyzed, only the 12‐ounce PET bottle has a recycling rate of over two percent. Also, while
PLA can be composted, this must be done in a commercial composting facility. PLA is not
suitable for backyard composting.
Cradle‐to‐grave GHG emissions from three products made from PLA (16‐ounce drink cup, 16‐
ounce deli container, 12‐ounce water bottle) were compared to those of the PET‐based products,
as shown in Table 9‐8. The mass for 10,000 product units is also shown. The GHG benefit of
replacing the PET with a PLA product was estimated by taking the difference between the PET
and PLA product GHG emissions and dividing by the PLA product mass. The GHG benefit of
this policy was estimated using the average of the GHG emissions benefits for the three
products. The resulting GHG benefits from producing 100,000 tons of PLA products are shown
in Table 9‐9.

Costs for Increased Bio‐Products Production and Use
With the rising cost of petroleum and advancements in production technology for PLA, PLA
has become cost competitive with PET. Recent prices for PLA are between $0.90/lb and
$1.00/lb127, recent prices for PET are between $0.9275/lb and $0.9775/lb128. Using the midpoint of
each price range and adjusting for the difference in density, the cost difference for replacing
PET with PLA was estimated, as shown in Table 9‐10. Using the total discounted costs in Table
9‐10 and the cumulative GHG reductions in Table 9‐9, the cost effectiveness for this
recommendation element was estimated to be ‐$62/tCO2e.

Key Assumptions:
The assumed electricity price is the assumed value to the farmer for the electricity produced (to
offset on‐farm use).
It is assumed that the gas produced can be utilized on site. While the gas cannot be stored, it is
assumed that sufficient opportunities exist to utilize the gas immediately.
For the purposes of quantification, it is assumed that certain technologies are employed. While
deployment may occur through other technology pathways, the assumed technologies are
necessary to estimate the costs associated with implementing this recommendation. The costs
associated with using manure as an alternative to fossil‐based generation are dependent on
many factors, including the end use (i.e. electricity, heat or steam), the design and size of the
systems, the technology employed, and the configuration specifications of the system. Each
system implemented under this policy would require a detailed analysis (incorporating specific
engineering design and costs aspects) to provide a more accurate cost estimate of the system.

______________________________________________________________________________
Production costs for PLA and PET plastics where not available, so the costs of this
recommendation where based on the price of the plastics. The GHG benefits and costs for
increased utilization of bioproducts was based on current production technology for PLA. With
improvements in the production process, GHG emissions and costs from PLA production may
be decreased. Another key assumption for the bioplastics estimates is that PLA products will
replace PET products. The AII analysis found that the GHG benefits of using PLA over other
types of plastic for some of the products was smaller than the benefit of replacing PET with
PLA.

Key Uncertainties
It is uncertain how willing and able farmers will be to develop on site projects (i.e. the technical
expertise of farmers in energy utilization or electricity production). The future price of
electricity is another uncertainty affecting the estimated costs. Also, the future costs of
producing PLA and PET are uncertain. PLA and PET prices are likely to fluctuate to changes in
production technology and changes in the prices of petroleum and biomass feedstocks.
For element B of this recommendation, the push for alternative management approaches for
WWTP biosolids hinges on future considerations of whether land application (for example,
Class B biosolids) will continue to be an recommendation. Gasification is one recommendation
for managing these and other organic wastes; however, it might not end up as the most
economic method (for instance, where biosolids or other wastes could be landfilled). Hence, the
quantification above on biosolids utilization could overstate the potential for management via
gasification.
Also for element B of this recommendation covering WWTP biosolids, other biomass and
organic wastes, and commercialization of emerging utilization technologies, the GHG benefits
and costs were only partially quantified, since WWTP biosolids were the only feedstock
captured in the analysis above. Additional study is needed on the potential for application of
these emerging technologies for other feedstock sources, such as beef cattle manure, horse
manure, other organic wastes, and potentially other biomass feedstocks that are not utilized
under AFW‐4 and AFW‐7.

Additional Benefits, Costs and Energy Security Fuel Savings
Anaerobic digesters reduce odor and the need for waste treatment. The dried fiber from the
digestion process can be used as fertilizer, feed supplement, bedding, or other uses.
For energy utilization of poultry litter, arsenic remaining in the digester sludge, combustor ash,
or gasifier residuals could present issues in the management of this material (e.g if levels are too
high for land application). Additional study of this issue is needed.
While PLA bio‐based plastic is biodegradable, it does not readily break down in a landfill. The
high heat in a commercial composting facility is needed to degrade PLA. In addition, PLA can

AFW-10. Programs to Support Local Farming/Buy Local

Policy Description
Promote the production and consumption of locally produced agricultural goods, including
transportation and heating fuel and plastics, which displace the consumption of those
transported from other states or countries.

Policy Design
Goals: Encourage the production of locally produced agricultural goods by 2025. Promote the
education of consumers on the consumption of local and seasonal goods.
Timing: Ongoing
Parties Involved: FDACS, producers, retailers, farmer’s markets

Other:
The FDACS Division of Marketing and Development has promoted the production and
consumption of locally grown or produced goods through the Florida Agricultural Promotional
Campaign, and through support to local Community Farmers’ Markets.
Over the last eight years the Florida retail campaign has focused considerable resources to
promote the Fresh from Florida agricultural products in local markets, including more than
1,250 retail outlets in Florida: Publix, Winn Dixie, Albertson’s, Sweet Bay, Harvey’s, and
Sedano. Retailers strategically place local stores to serve customers normally within a five to 10
mile radius. This system is the best means of moving sufficient quantities of fresh product into
an efficient distribution system already in existence.
The campaign supports the Community Farmers’ Markets by providing a kit on “How to
Organize, Operate and Market Farmers’ Markets in Florida.” This kit offers resources, including
sample market rules, vendor applications, and a sample questionnaire for farmers. Marketing
and management advice to these organizations are provided as requested. These farmers’
markets are promoted through the maintenance of a directory and Web site. There is also a Web
site being developed that list Community Supported Agriculture operations. The Farmers’
Market Nutrition programs provide monetary support to these markets in the participating 16
counties.

Implementation Mechanisms
Educate public on benefits of consumption of local and seasonal goods.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
GHG reductions occur from reduced transportation‐related emissions and reduced embedded
energy.

Emissions. Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, Iowa State University, available at:

Choices in the United States,” Environmental Science & Technology 42:10.
Quantification Methods: Not quantified.
Key Assumptions: Not applicable.

Key Uncertainties
It is likely that the fuel savings accrued through reduced ton‐miles will offset the potential
increases in production costs associated with increased localized food production. While the
exact interaction of these competing economic factors is uncertain, locally produced and
consumed food products will become more cost‐effective as fuel costs increase.

Additional Benefits, Costs, and Energy Security Fuel Savings
In addition to emission reductions due to reduced transportation, other environmental and
economic benefits associated with localizing packaging, refrigeration, storage, and processing
may also be realized through the implementation of this recommendation.
There are a plethora of additional direct and indirect social, health and economic benefits
accrued from marketing local goods.
Shortening the supply chain and distance between producer and consumer puts more money
directly in the pocket of producers within the community. The community benefits from this
localized exchange by keeping dollars circulating within the community instead of being a net‐
exporter of capital.

Research suggests that fresh produce can contain higher nutritional content than older produce
contributing to more robust health. Consumers concerned about food growing practices and
handling can inquire directly from producers.

Feasibility Issues
The ability to produce some goods locally may be limited given the local conditions such as
local land quality (e.g. soil fertility), local climate (e.g. precipitation), available infrastructure
(e.g. transportation network) and/or the willingness of consumers to buy local produce.

GP-1. Targets, Reporting, Funding, and Accountability Measures

Policy Description
The State of Florida is committed to significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
and has established emissions inventory, forecasting, reporting, and registry functions in state
agencies, specifically in the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). Through
House Bill 7135 (HB 7135, the ‘Energy Bill’), the 2008 Florida Legislature directed the Public
Service Commission (PSC) to promulgate a rule implementing a Renewable Portfolio Standard
(RPS), and the PSC has issued a draft rule for comment. HB 7135 established the Florida Energy
and Climate Commission (FECC), demonstrating the state’s long‐term commitment to reduce
its carbon footprint. The Legislature also considered an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard
(EEPS) in 2008.It is strongly recommended that the state develop a dedicated funding source,
such as a system benefits charge (SBC) to provide funding to help achieve targets for renewable
energy and energy efficiency. This will be a key policy step towards achieving significant GHG
emissions reductions.
The following are further descriptions of the above‐mentioned functions:

•

Florida set GHG emissions reductions targets, as established under Executive Order 07‐127.
Specifically, the targets are 2000 levels by 2017, 1990 levels by 2025, and 80 percent of 1990
levels by 2050. The following policy recommendations support these targets but recognize
that, in the future, revisions may be needed because of scientific and technological advances.
A process will be necessary to periodically review and revise targets.

•

GHG emissions inventories and forecasts are essential for understanding the magnitude of
all emission sources and sinks (natural and those created by human activities), the relative
contribution of various types of emission sources and sinks to total emissions, and the
factors affecting trends over time. Inventories and forecasts help to inform policy makers
and the public on statewide trends and on opportunities for mitigating emissions or
enhancing sinks; they also help verify GHG reductions associated with implementation of
GHG reduction action plans and other initiatives.

•

GHG reporting supports the tracking and management of emissions over time. GHG
reporting can help sources identify emission reduction opportunities and reduce risks
associated with possible future GHG mandates. Tracking and reporting of GHG emissions
can also help in the construction or revision of periodic state GHG inventories. GHG
reporting is a prerequisite for sources to participate in GHG reduction programs,
opportunities for recognition, and a GHG emission registry, as well as to secure “baseline
protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions).

•

An RPS is a requirement that utilities must supply a certain, generally fixed percentage of
electricity from an eligible renewable energy source(s). More than two dozen states have an

E‐2
Appendix E

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
RPS in place. About 25 states currently have some sort of SBC in place. The following is a
table summarizing the various SBCs and RPSs in effect around the nation. Funds are
typically generated as a charge on the electric bill and are used to ensure that the RPS and
related energy efficiency portfolio standards (EEPS) are met. A clearly defined value for a
renewable energy target (for example, 20 percent by 2020, as the Governor has suggested)
and a clearly defined value for the energy efficiency target must be specified. The funding
for each of these two important, yet distinct, ways to meet GHG reduction targets must also
be separated. Once RPS and EEPS targets have been set, they must be measured and verified
continually along with their impact on GHG reductions. Developing a mechanism for
cataloging the GHG reductions in a registry is imperative to securing the veracity of the
reductions and the value of those reductions as a tradable financial instrument. The
Government Policy (GP) Technical Working Group (TWG) suggests that consideration also
be given to a broader environmental attributes registry that may be linked to water
pollution trading credits as well as GHG reductions.

A GHG registry enables the recording of GHG emission reductions in a central repository
with “transaction ledger” capacity to support tracking, management, and “ownership” of
emission reductions; establish baseline protection; enable recognition of environmental
leadership; and provide a mechanism for regional, multistate, and cross‐border cooperation.
Properly designed registry structures also provide a foundation for possible future trading
programs. Florida is a member of The Climate Registry (TCR) and as such can take
advantage of the programs and protocols offered by TCR to member jurisdictions.

Policy Design
To support these initiatives, mechanisms must be created to:

•

Periodically review and revise established goals or targets for statewide GHG‐emission
reductions, RPSs, and energy efficiency targets and review the effectiveness of using the
SBC to meet goals or targets.

•

Establish RPS and EEPS targets and mandatory GHG emissions reporting, inventory, and
forecasting functions at state agencies. In addition, develop an inventory and forecast
system that is aligned with national protocols and tailored to specific emissions and/or sinks
found in Florida.

•

Provide technical assistance to emissions reporters and encourage participation.

•

Institute an accountability program to measure and report progress in reducing GHG
emissions. This program would allow the state to keep track of emission reductions and
help determine what is and is not working.

•

Measure and report on research and development (R&D), job creation, and new business
investment resulting from related “green” economy programs and review the effectiveness
of state funds used to promote those programs.

The Action Team recommends that Florida establish GHG reduction targets for local, state, and
regional government operations and school districts, with an emphasis on energy efficiency for
transportation and non‐transportation uses to meet the targets. The establishment of these
targets will be helpful in setting an example for nongovernmental entities and will help
agencies to focus on performing the necessary analysis. Reductions should be reported at the
agency level. Thus, local, state, and regional government agencies or departments would first
need to develop GHG emissions inventory data that are agency‐ or department‐specific, ideally
building on existing energy‐use reporting data. This would become the baseline data for
ongoing emission reduction activities and measurement, which could be included in annual
reporting for all entities. Agency or department reports would be aggregated into a summary
report reflecting state GHG emissions. A multiagency group should oversee the ongoing
climate efforts of the government’s agencies or departments; review their performance; and
provide guidance, resources, shared approaches, and recognition to agencies or departments
and their employees working to reduce the government’s GHG emissions.

Goals:
Beginning in 2010, the FECC should review progress toward achieving the Florida Executive
Order 07‐127 GHG reduction goals and review and affirm or propose revisions to the goals
every three years, assuming the necessary resources are available to properly complete this
review.

Timing:
•

Implementation of a GHG inventory for previous years shall continue.

•

Timing of the current GHG inventory and forecasting efforts shall proceed as initiated
under the Action Team process. Future efforts will be based on the timing of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reporting rule.

Parties Involved: DEP, FECC, the PSC, state agencies, local and regional governments, Florida
Association of Counties (FAC), Florida League of Cities (FLC), Florida League of Mayors (FLM),
regional leagues of cities, and the Regional Planning Councils (RPCs).
Various other state agencies will need to provide assistance with the forecast.
Other: None

Implementation Mechanisms
The FECC, in coordination with the DEP, should create a clearinghouse function in the
appropriate department to work with, coordinate, and aggregate local and regional goals,
programs, and reporting on the GHG mitigation progress. This clearinghouse should be
developed with the participation of the FAC, FLC, FLM, local governments, regional leagues of
cities, and the RPCs.
In conjunction with the programs and policies described in GP‐2, Public Awareness and
Education, the clearinghouse or the FECC should periodically issue reports for the Legislature
and general public consumption regarding recent and longer‐term trends of Florida’s electricity
consumption and liquid fuels consumption and the efficiency of Florida’s personal and
commercial vehicle fleet. These reports should convey these trends in simple, easy to replicate
and grasp graphics, like the United Way “thermometer.”

•

The DEP should coordinate with EPA and TCR on the development of a mandatory federal
GHG reporting rule (see FY2008 [fiscal year 2008] Consolidated Appropriations
Amendment).1

○

This GHG rule will define sources, thresholds for reporting, and frequency of reporting.
The GHG rule can be used to define reporting standards for the previous year’s
emissions.

○

The rule will apply to the following gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous
oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur
hexafluoride (SF6).

○

Forecasting of GHG emissions will be included as part of the state responsibilities. In
forecasting future GHG emissions, treatment of uncertainties should be transparent, be
as consistent as possible across sectors and time and, to the extent possible, reflect
multiple scenarios.

Inventory and other related information shall be gathered for all previous years through
1990.

Progress reports should be made available to the public by every reporting period, at a
minimum.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Governor’s Executive Order 07‐126 established GHG reduction goals for state agencies of a 10
percent reduction from current emission levels by 2012, a 25 percent reduction from current
levels by 2017, and a 40 percent reduction from current levels by 2025.
Governor’s Executive Order 07‐127 established goals for reduction to 2000 levels by 2017, to
1990 levels by 2025, and to 80 percent of 1990 levels by 2050. This Order also required adoption
of the California motor vehicle emission standards. The standard is a 22 percent reduction in
vehicle emissions by 2012 and a 30 percent reduction by 2016. Under HB 7135, if DEP adopts
this rule, it must be ratified by the Legislature to become effective.
The Executive Office of the Governor is tracking and reporting financial savings and emissions
reductions associated with Executive Order 07‐126 via the Florida Government Carbon
Scorecard. Executive Order 07‐128 directs the state to provide “Policies for emission reporting
and registry that measures and documents emissions reductions.”

Recent Actions in Florida
As a result of Executive Order 07‐127 and the mandate in HB 7135, the PSC held a series of
workshops on RPSs in 2007, and in August of 2008, they released a draft rule for public
comment.

GP-2. Public Awareness and Education

Policy Description
Focusing on public awareness and education is predicated on the fact that if Florida wants to be
recognized as an eco‐literate state, it can do so only if efforts are embraced and actions are taken
by everyone—from high‐level policy makers at one end of the citizenry, to individuals at the
other.
The goal is for every man, woman, and child in Florida—young and old, those in Florida’s cities
and those on the beaches, those in the research labs and those in the orange groves—to know
that Florida will be recognized for its commitment to the environment at all levels. Accordingly,
there must be an expectation for all Floridians to do their part to protect, to sustain, to restore
and, most importantly, to re‐engage in a dialogue with the state’s most precious resources: our
land, our water, and the air we breathe.
The efforts Florida undertakes to educate its citizens will be a reflection of the urgency with
which it views climate change, the precariousness of the environment, and the need to
dramatically reduce existing energy use in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.
Education at all levels must begin immediately if Florida is to take the next critical steps to
become a national leader.

Policy Design
Floridians doing their part assumes that individual citizens know what can and should be done
and are provided the tools and the incentives to do it. This is the core role of public awareness
and education, and policy design in this area is a three‐step process: (1) identify the relevant
audiences and sectors for purposes of optimal communication; (2) determine what to
communicate and how to begin what, if designed correctly, will be perceived as a dialogue; and
(3) gather feedback via that dialogue to determine the extent to which the information, tools,
assistance, and incentives provided are understood, useful, and worthwhile. If these
assumptions are correct, then magnitude is increased; if they are not, then corrections need to be
made before proceeding further.
Because the second and third steps are more operative than policy‐driven, they will need to be
addressed in greater detail at a later point in time. They move beyond policy design and into
policy implementation. Once entertained, the individual strategies will ultimately populate a
toolbox of potential actions—large and small, general and specific—to sub‐audiences. However,
it is not too early at the policy formation stage to consider the general audience clusters that will
need to be considered.

Appendix E – GP, 10-01-08

Traditional Education as a Target Audience
The traditional audience of a K–20 education system is entirely relevant and must be given due
attention. Learning the alphabet of eco‐literacy must begin in preschool and kindergarten, with
successive and increasingly sophisticated lessons, applications, and connections throughout the
formative years so that, as a by‐product, more middle and high school students are comfortable
exploring the possibilities of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics as professions.
Progress in this area will entail ensuring that eco‐literacy curricula and performance standards
are created for science and social studies programs, and that “eco‐literacy‐across‐the‐
curriculum” is explored and rewarded.
Similarly, the state’s colleges and universities need to make the cultural shift away from
viewing eco‐literacy as synonymous with environmental science programs. Rather, eco‐literacy
should be a component that traverses the traditional boundaries of the academy—into
programs in architecture and building construction, throughout regional planning and health
care administration degrees and, most assuredly, through our business schools—so that
graduates can begin to challenge the unspoken financial argument currently being made for not
addressing the environmental and energy issues of today. In summation, a sustained and
comprehensive eco‐literacy component for K–20 must be a part of the twenty‐first century
curriculum.
Also of relevance in postsecondary education is the appreciation and support for the R&D that
will help create Florida’s green economy. Alternate energy sources, as well as the many forms
that energy efficiency may take—from the creation of composite materials to the planning
necessary for transportation configurations—must continue to be valued and recognized as
central to the larger issue of eco‐literacy.

Other Target Audiences
Beyond the audience afforded by traditional education, Florida must devote its time, energy,
and resources to increasing awareness and engaging the public‐at‐large with regard to the good
decisions in personal and professional lives that can be made to favorably impact climate
change and reduce energy usage. These include the decisions of individuals and groups of
community‐based organizations, religious leaders, business leaders, institutions, visitors and,
most importantly, average Floridians. Florida must determine how to market the savings
associated with reducing the carbon footprint of all of these constituents.
All across the wide range of corporate and economic activities, education and awareness efforts
can help incorporate climate change efforts into business plans and best practices. Among these
sectors are Florida’s growing high‐tech industry, its agricultural base, and its historical strength
in tourism, all three of which will be enormously impacted by climate change and energy crises.
One concept that is recommended is a “Florida Climate Challenge” to mobilize all Floridians to
reduce energy usage in their homes, vehicles, and places of work. It would encourage citizens to
voluntarily sign up and accept the challenge of reducing their energy by measuring their

“footprint” and then reducing their footprint by some target level with measurement tools,
information, incentives, advice, and encouragement from the Governor, Legislature, and the
FECC.

Target Audience: Local, State, and Regional Government Entities
While attention must be placed on the general public as a critical audience for education and
public awareness; government at all levels will be a key to ramping up and building on
individual successes. In the same manner that good governments coordinate, communicate,
share, and incent one another in times of emergencies such as hurricanes, Florida needs the
same communicative network to focus on and assist with energy and climate issues. One
strategy at the state level, for example, might be to form a climate change education and
outreach council to coordinate information and efforts regarding climate change action plans,
best practices, and associated policies. In turn, local and regional government entities need to
consider strategies that will enhance education and public awareness.
To conclude, good policy design regarding education and public awareness will be fleshed out
in these areas:

•

Audience and sub‐audience identification;

•

Message, tools, and incentives creation;

•

Communication systems developed or adapted and tested; and

•

Feedback assessment, corrections made as necessary, and magnitude increased.

Goals:
By June 2009, the State of Florida in cooperation with federal, regional, and local governments,
the business community, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), the faith community, and
other interested parties will have implemented a state‐wide Florida Climate Challenge to
inform and motivate all Floridians on the importance of reducing their usage of energy from
carbon‐emitting sources and the most efficient and effective ways to do it.
By January 2010, 50 percent or more of Floridians, when surveyed, will acknowledge the
seriousness of climate change impacts and will have reduced their personal usage of energy
from carbon‐ emitting sources by 10 percent.
By January 2010, 50 percent of businesses, when surveyed, will acknowledge the seriousness of
climate change impacts and will have reduced their usage of energy from carbon‐emitting
sources by 10 percent.
By January, 2010, 100 percent of governmental agencies at the regional, state, and local levels,
when surveyed, will have reduced their usage of energy from carbon‐emitting sources by 25
percent.

By June 2010, the “Florida Climate and Energy Challenge” will be expanded, and additional
milestones and energy reduction targets will be established out to the year 2050 for citizens, the
business community, and all governmental agencies, based on the initial survey results and
needed carbon emission reductions to meet the 80 percent reduction from 1990 levels by 2050.
Timing: Education and Outreach Committee appointed by the Governor by October 1, 2009.
Parties Involved: Office of the Governor; FECC; Florida Department of Education; Florida
Board of Governors; Florida Chamber of Commerce; Florida Association of Businesses and
Industry; Florida Council of 100; religious organizations; regional government coordinating
agencies; FLM; Florida Department of Agriculture; DEP; the Office of Tourism, Trade, and
Economic Development (OTTED); Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT); and the press.
Other: None.

Implementation Mechanisms
The Governor should form a climate change education and outreach committee (coordinated by
FECC) to educate the public and other audiences regarding the climate change action plan and
its associated policies and to oversee outreach activities. The committee should be formed of
appointees and supported by outreach coordinators from relevant state agencies (e.g., energy
supply, forestry, and agriculture). The committee should:

•

Create and maintain one or more outreach coordinator positions in relevant executive
agencies specifically tasked with climate change issues.

•

Assess the level (establish a baseline) of public understanding of the impacts of climate
change and of (proposed) state‐specific actions to deal with climate change.

•

Create the “Florida Climate and Energy Challenge program” with a public relations firm
that can craft the message of how important and urgent it is for all Floridians to work to
reduce their energy usage. The program would be implemented through the FECC and the
DEP. A Web site could function as a clearinghouse of climate change information and
resources specific to Florida. The Challenge would ask Floridians to sign up; pledge to
measure (through a Web‐based survey tool) their carbon footprint; make changes to lifestyle
and appliances or make other changes to reduce emissions; and register the reductions on
the site.

•

Establish a recurring awards program to recognize leadership and attainment of goals and
objectives of the Florida Climate Change Action Plan.

•

Engage and partner with the Florida business community to coordinate and leverage
private sector–sponsored messages and initiatives to help implement the “Florida Climate
Challenge.”

Increase awareness and engage in climate change actions in personal and professional lives
through the following actions:

•

Educate broadcasters, reporters, editorial boards, and others about climate change, the risks
it imposes, and actions Floridians can take. Work with state broadcasters and print media
associations to develop and run public service announcements (PSAs) concerning climate
change.

•

Work with existing business outreach efforts to customers to enhance awareness of climate
change issues and opportunities.

•

Provide and advertise marketplace incentives to adopt and purchase goods with the
minimum climate change footprint.

Integrate climate change into educational curricula, post‐secondary degree programs, and
professional licensing (see policy GP‐5) to address the multidisciplinary approach to reduce
adverse climate‐change effects.

•

Ensure performance standards for the inclusion of climate change curricula in public
education (K–12), identify gaps in climate change education, and provide specific curricula
to fill any gaps.

•

Integrate best practices into public school design and construction and use this as a means to
educate the public about how to educate students (and parents) firsthand in their
communities and colleges.

•

Organize groups of educators to identify, assemble, and employ climate change curricula
appropriate to specific age groups. Make curricula and associated materials available to
educational courses that are not publicly funded.

•

Integrate climate change into core college curricula, promote research into climate change
and solutions at state universities, and develop university Centers of Excellence on climate
issues, new approaches, and technologies.

•

Develop assessment tools to determine the impact of climate change curricula.

•

Include climate change discussions at state‐funded venues, such as science centers, zoos,
and museums.

GP-3. Inter-Governmental Planning Coordination and Assistance

Policy Description
Given the high priority of climate change mitigation in the State of Florida, numerous local,
state, and regional government agencies are tasked with implementing climate policies or, at a
minimum, integrating energy efficiency principles into their operations. Efficient coordination
among agencies and between local, state, and regional government will enhance overall
effectiveness, reduce overlap, and eliminate barriers to GHG mitigation efforts. Fortunately,
many of Florida’s cities and counties have embraced the mission; at least 70 mayors have signed
the U.S. Conference of Mayors’ (USCM’s) Climate Protection Agreement and agree with its
ambitious reduction goals. Eight or more counties have joined the International Council for
Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), the Cool Counties program, or similar efforts. Many
Florida local jurisdictions, large and small, embarked on GHG reduction efforts more than a
decade ago and therefore have wisdom and best practices worthy of replication.
Local governments will be among the state’s most vital partners in addressing climate change.
Decisions regarding land use, transportation, land conservation efforts, landscaping
requirements, solid waste management, water distribution and, in public power communities,
energy supply, are all made at the local level. Planning agencies will need to coordinate,
especially those with a role in transportation infrastructure, because transit offers among the
most potent reduction opportunities. The built environment and its building efficiency are also
significant contributors to GHG emissions; that sector is an immediately accessible and active
sector that could benefit from policy support. Development patterns present another key area
because denser land‐use patterns and smaller homes help reduce trips and save energy.
The State of Florida is unique in that it has an existing comprehensive planning framework,
which is the foundation of the state’s growth management program. It provides for the
coordination of state, regional, and local planning decisions. This Local Government
Comprehensive Planning Act is administered by the Florida Department of Community Affairs
(DCA). As part of this framework, the RPCs are tasked with planning and coordinating
intergovernmental solutions to issues of state and regional concern. Therefore, to facilitate and
expedite climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts throughout the state, Florida’s policy
makers should work through the DCA in conjunction with the RPCs to use the local
government comprehensive planning process to improve coordination and ensure that each
level of government is working toward the same goals in a mutually supportive and consistent
manner.
“Leading‐by‐Example” is one of the most effective ways for governments to convey the
importance of climate response to the broader public. State government can help lead and build
on the existing work that is underway at local and regional levels by (1) collecting and
facilitating access to information about best practices; (2) providing cost‐benefit analyses of the

various approaches available to local governments in a fiscally constrained environment; (3)
documenting the economic benefits or payoffs for local governments, their constituencies, and
businesses that are considering the implementation of green practices; (4) eliminating state
subsidies or favorable tax treatment for programs or policies that are contrary to GHG
reduction efforts; (5) identifying and eliminating state policies that unduly contribute to the
generation of GHG emissions; (6) finding ways to say yes to local and regional partnerships and
solutions; (7) funding the Florida Green Governments Grant Program and similar programs
that support local and regional government initiatives; and (8) expediting state‐level review and
decision‐making processes, if applicable, to facilitate implementation of local and regional
efforts. Creating a statewide infrastructure or action plan to achieve GHG reductions will allow
all coordinating agencies to be on the same page. In addition, determining regional GHG
averages and encouraging use of a consistent system for local governments to quantitatively
assess their reduction progress would facilitate their engagement in this effort and allow them
to gauge their progress and efficacy.
As documented in the “Plans and Planners” document prepared for this process and available
at http://www.flclimatechange.us/ewebeditpro/items/O12F16370.pdf , there are multiple
agencies and jurisdictions with overlapping authority to plan and regulate a wide range of
activities that directly or indirectly impact emissions. The Action Team proposes to directly
improve coordination and consistency between these agencies and jurisdictions relative to GHG
issues.
In its “States Guidance Document: Policy Planning to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions”
(Second Edition, 1998), EPA addresses the process of planning, implementing, and
administering climate change mitigation programs. Specific topics addressed include the actors
who affect climate change program design, political considerations related to climate change
program development, treatment of time perspectives, interactions between various agencies
that are internal and external to state governments, general program administration, and
program financing. While primarily focused on implementation efforts by states, the key points
highlighted by EPA can be applied to all levels of governments and organizations pursuing
climate change program development and implementation. A key point of the document
discusses the coordination of climate change programs and interaction between agencies. In its
report, EPA identifies coordination among various state agencies, as well as between federal,
state, and local governments, as a critical factor for success.

Policy Design
To accomplish the goals set forth above, the following are recommended:

•

Coordinate federal, regional, state, and local government roles and policy with regard to
climate change impacts and response. Coordinate activities and programs to facilitate rapid
and meaningful actions on the part of government decision makers.

•

Integrate the comprehensive planning process as administered by DCA in conjunction with
the RPCs with transportation and land‐use planning by regional, state, and local
governments to reduce GHG emissions as guided by the new provisions in House Bill 697.

•

Work through the RPCs to improve coordination and collaboration among local
governments to develop agreed upon strategies and regional implementation goals and
benchmarks addressing GHG emission reduction and climate change adaptation.

•

Establish incentives, provide technical support, and fund mandated programs that enable
local governments to access federal and state funding to undertake inventories; develop
GHG reduction initiatives for planning, facilities, and operations; and promote consistent
reporting and information sharing.

•

Work with the FAC, FLC, FLM, local governments, regional leagues of cities, metropolitan
planning organizations (MPOs), water management districts (WMDs), and the RPCs to
reach agreement on one or more standardized methodologies for emissions measurement
and reporting (e.g., the ICLEI method) and fund software licenses. Encourage regional
collaborations.

•

Celebrate successes and publicize demonstrated and documented “best practices” for other
local governments. Provide educational opportunities and information to public, private,
and nonprofit policy makers at the local, state, and regional levels.

•

Coordinate overlapping planning authorities to promote consistent regard for energy use
and emissions reduction efforts.

•

Link the broad range of state infrastructure investments to improved and integrated
transportation and land uses that encourage a reduction in vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
and GHG emissions, improved energy efficiency, affordable housing proximate to urban
work centers, and progress toward other sustainability and quality of life measures. Utilize
performance‐based methodologies that promote the reduction of GHG emissions, for
example, transportation methodologies that support alternatives to automobile travel,
including transit.

•

Review and examine the integration of energy, climate, and water policy. Recognizing the
nexus between energy and water, the FECC should draw together recommendations to
integrate policies across these three critical issues.

Goals: Contingent upon having available funding and necessary programs in place, all counties
with a population of more than 200,000 need to have current GHG emissions inventories and
mitigation action plans completed by the end of 2010.
Timing: See Goals, above.
Parties Involved: FAC, FLC, FLM, FDOT, local governments, regional leagues of cities, WMDs,
RPCs, MPOs, DCA, DEP, the Legislature, and FECC.

Other: A number of policy recommendations involving the relationship between water and
energy are being offered across working groups through the Action Team Phase II process. The
Action Team or the FECC should examine integrating these policy recommendations to bring
forward consistent and coordinated water/energy/climate proposals.

Implementation Mechanisms
Tier 1—Near‐term actions:
Offer incentives or programs for local governments to undertake inventories and GHG
reduction initiatives for local government planning, facilities, and operations. The following are
specific incentives:

•

Solicit input from local governments on what incentives would assist them in implementing
GHG reductions efforts.

•

Provide financial and technical assistance for planning.

•

Assemble, evaluate, and distribute a database of local government programs and actions
that have proven to substantially and cost‐effectively reduce emissions.

•

Provide technical support to local governments to enable them to access federal funding for
inventories and GHG reductions; publicize and reward best practices for governments.

•

Sponsor a local government and state agency recognition program for successful mitigation
efforts.

Tier 2—Longer‐term actions:
•

DCA, in cooperation with the FECC, should convene a working group with representatives
of DCA, FDOT, DEP, local governments, MPOs, RPCs, and others as appropriate to study
and recommend changes in practice, agreement, rule, or law that are needed to incorporate
climate change considerations, facilitate coordination, and minimize inconsistent and
overlapping authority between departments and levels of government; these changes would
help facilitate and expedite climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts throughout the
state.

•

Require state and regional agencies and departments to review policies and funding
programs. Fund these activities through state appropriations.

•

The Executive Office of the Governor and executive agencies need to work closely with the
Florida Legislature and the United States Congress to encourage proposals which may
promote greater coordination and consistency between levels of government and agencies
on matters affecting GHG emissions.

•

DEP and the five WMDs should review the State Water Use Plan and regional water supply
plans as well as Chapter 373, Florida Statutes, “Stormwater Policy” to evaluate and
determine their energy impacts and make recommendations to the FECC for measures to
reduce GHG emissions and energy uses in Florida.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
It is anticipated that the EECBG, which has been passed by both houses of Congress and is
currently in the appropriations process, will establish a program similar to the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG). Local governments will be eligible for federal grants, based
on population, to address local opportunities to save energy and reduce emissions. The initial
year’s grant requirements will incorporate planning and forecasting efforts. The State of Florida
would be well served to assist cities and counties in their efforts to obtain these funds,
coordinate efforts with nongovernmental partners, and apply them toward the most fruitful
emission reduction opportunities.
HB 697 provides significant direction in the area of transportation, comprehensive planning,
and GHG‐emissions reduction.
The Volunteer Florida program provides assistance to Florida municipalities.
The Florida Legislature passed HB 7135, which establishes, in part, a “Florida Green
Governments Grants Act” that provides for grants to be awarded “to local governments in the
development of programs that achieve green standards.” Although it was not funded this year,
establishment of the program and the statement of legislative support is an important step
forward.
A number of Florida cities and counties have adopted the USCM’s Climate Protection
Agreement, the ICLEI, and the Cool Counties program.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
All six statutory GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6) should be reduced.

GP-4. “Green” Business Development Policies

Policy Description
Climate change impacts are likely to have significant effects on all sectors of Florida’s economy.
Some sectors will face acute challenges, while others will enjoy substantial growth
opportunities. GHG mitigation and climate adaptation are also likely to create entirely new
economic and employment opportunities. Substantial investment is expected in energy
efficiency implementation and renewable energy technologies. These investments hold the
promise of diversifying and strengthening the Florida economy.
While there are economic opportunities, there will be costs associated with the transition to a
low‐carbon economy. However, the Action Teamconsiders the costs associated with inaction to
be far greater than the investments associated with GHG reductions. The sooner actions are
undertaken, the lower the costs to society. The result is an increasing sense of urgency, as well
as an informed understanding that successful responses must be scaled to meet the challenge at
hand.
Successful state GHG reduction efforts are highly dependent on active participation of the
business community, particularly in the energy, agriculture, transportation, development,
construction, and manufacturing sectors. Efforts must also be made to prepare and train the
skilled workforce to enable new technologies to rapidly assimilate into the marketplace. All of
these investments hold the promise of diversifying and strengthening Florida’s economy. The
intent of this policy is to encourage and facilitate the involvement of funding and investment
sources, business interests, and entrepreneurs in quickly seizing business opportunities related
to GHG reductions and climate change solutions.
The state will benefit by early identification of business opportunities associated with climate
change by increasing its global competitive advantage and job creation within the state.
The state may also consider providing strategic support to existing critical economic sectors,
such as tourism and other natural resource‐based industries that may experience stress.
Potential funding sources include philanthropic organizations or individuals, or others
interested in supporting innovative market solutions that are environmentally effective.
Recognizing that fortunes are likely to be made in the “new energy economy,” for‐profit
investors, pension funds, mutual funds, and venture capitalists may be looking to fund similar
business opportunities. Although technology entrepreneurs are often cited as offering potential
climate change solutions, equally progressive solutions may lie in the fields of law, accounting,
marketing, production, and even government relations and lobbying. The objective of this
policy recommendation is to leverage the state’s specific talents and natural resources for
climate change solutions into securing the business opportunities and market advantages that
well‐supported, early efforts are likely to reap in a carbon‐constrained world. This policy also

intends to ensure that Florida has a qualified workforce with the appropriate skill sets within
these existing and emerging sectors to capture these investments as effectively as possible.

Policy Design
Successful state GHG‐reduction efforts are highly dependent on active participation of the
business community, particularly in the energy, agriculture, transportation, development,
construction, and manufacturing sectors. The intent of this policy is to encourage and facilitate
the involvement of funding and investment sources, business interests, and entrepreneurs in
pursuing business opportunities associated with GHG reductions and climate change solutions
as quickly and as significantly as possible.
Florida should foster R&D associated with GHG emission reductions, renewable energy, and
energy efficiency technologies. The State of Florida should consider whole life cycle costs of
potential energy technologies. The state should also promote business, job development, and
workforce training in alternative low‐carbon fuels and vehicles and other alternative low‐
carbon technologies, such as energy efficiency.
The Office of Tourism Trade and Economic Development (OTTED) and Enterprise Florida—in
conjunction with the FECC—should undertake an analysis to look at new opportunities and at
economic sectors that may be negatively impacted. Particular attention should be paid to the
potential impact on Florida’s tourism and other natural resource–based economic sectors.2
Florida should commit to a comprehensive process of mapping labor resources (traditional and
nontraditional) and assets capable of implementing workforce solutions to provide much
needed awareness of the scope and scale of the challenge. An assessment should be made of key
skilled trades, manufacturing, and other energy‐related educational programs, from secondary
to post‐secondary, to determine whether sufficient programs are in place to meet the need
ahead. Industry‐recognized certifications associated with greening Florida’s economy should be
identified and supported as stipulated in Florida’s Career and Professional Education Act.
Further, Florida should strengthen, encourage, and guide, when necessary, the integration of
workforce and economic development efforts distributed among industry, economic
development organizations, educational institutions, and labor organizations that will ensure
maximum mutual benefit, align public and private resources, and heighten cooperation toward
the common goal of GHG emission reductions.
The state should unify existing resources and entities with those created under HB 7135 (FECC
and the Florida Energy Systems Consortium [FESC]) to support businesses in greening their
operations and promote business development opportunities in climate protection and
adaptation, including seeking or stimulating funding investments. This can be accomplished by:

•

2

Undertaking an analysis of potential opportunities in green industry development and
targeting those technologies for which Florida has an advantage. Examples include energy

efficiency implementation from building retrofits to waste heat recovery and renewable
technologies, such as ocean wave and current energy, wind power, solar thermal and
photovoltaics (PV), biomass, and biofuels.

•

Analyzing targeted incentives to promote private investment in these technologies or
industries, such as tax credits, investment in academic programs and research, grant
funding, and investment in workforce development.

•

Considering funding opportunities for clean energy technologies through the 33 investment
funds managed by the State Board of Administration (with total assets valued at $154
billion), among which is the Florida Retirement System Pension Plan Trust Fund, the fourth
largest public retirement plan in the United States.

•

Promoting the use of commercially ready technologies through a targeted RPS, an EEPS,
building codes, appliance standards, rebates, and tax incentives (sales, property, or
investment).

Other measures to accomplish this might include encouraging “business incubator” programs
at Florida universities and colleges to attract and support new business development related to
the new energy economy.
Florida should offer incentive points for competitive grant programs for state‐to‐business
economic development for businesses that have undertaken GHG reduction and energy
efficiency programs.
The designation or creation of a clearinghouse entity would enable the matching of technology
developers and other climate solution entrepreneurs with necessary financing more effectively
and expeditiously. As a result, the state’s ability to identify and secure early business
opportunities associated with climate change may be enhanced, increasing its global
competitive advantage and increasing job creation within the state. This clearinghouse function
might be performed by Florida’s network of Small Business Development Centers, or perhaps
coordinated through them.
The state should promote low‐carbon fuels and vehicles through government actions with
public education campaigns, tax and other incentives, and encouragement.
Recognizing the nexus between water treatment use and reuse and energy production and
consumption, the state should promote the use and development of effective water
conservation plans, low‐energy water treatment technologies, and water‐conserving products
and technologies, such as those certified through EPA’s WaterSense program or the Florida
Water Star public education program initiated by the St. Johns River Water Management
District and being adopted around the state.
Having a government focal point for promoting the development of climate protection
businesses would enhance the efficiencies of such an effort.

Goals:
•

Meet the GHG reduction goals set out in the 2007 executive orders (80 percent below 1990
levels by 2050, with interim goals of 2000 levels by 2017 and 1990 levels by 2025);

•

Determine funding resources to best manage and accomplish target goals;

•

Review, determine, and encourage green investing opportunities, including the state
treasury and pension fund; and

•

Review and determine workforce needs for greening Florida’s economy.

Timing: As soon as possible.
Parties Involved: FECC (Office of the Governor), DEP, FDOT, PSC, Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FWC), Florida Building Commission (FBC), the OTTED (Office of
the Governor), Enterprise Florida, Workforce Florida, the State Board of Administration, and
the Chief Financial Officer.

Implementation Mechanisms
Some implementation mechanisms are described in the Policy Design, above. Many of these
will require state agency rulemaking by FBC, DEP, and PSC. In addition to these proposals, the
state should require the use of applicable “green buildings” standards for the award of state
contracts for state‐owned and state‐funded projects.
Florida Department of Management Services is required by HB 7135 to develop guidelines for
determining what represents a green product and to produce a list of approved products for
use by state departments. Beyond this, state agencies should favor contracting with firms that
undertake green standards in business operations and in proposed contract work.
Florida should also define “green jobs.” Enterprise Florida should conduct or commission a
study of job opportunities and develop a targeted strategy for Florida, perhaps modeled after
the “Green Pathways” report from Wisconsin. That report offered the following policy
implementation principles:

•

Target specific sectors within the green jobs universe.

•

Use good data on labor market opportunities and skill gaps to drive green jobs initiatives.

•

Measure and evaluate green jobs programs and make them better.

•

Employ energy standards as green job creation tools.

•

Promote green industry clusters.

•

Design green jobs initiatives to save existing jobs and to create new ones.

•

Link green economic and workforce development.

•

Construct green industry partnerships.

•

Integrate green jobs initiatives into existing workforce systems.

•

Build greener career pathways.

•

Extend green ladders to build real pathways out of poverty.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Action Team, in their Phase 1 deliberations, recommended further examination of ways the
state can support public and private efforts to develop alternative fuels and technologies in
Florida. The Action Team also recommended that policies be developed that promote the use of
low‐carbon vehicles. There are several state and federal grant programs, some administered
through the Florida Energy Office (FEO), that attempt to incentivize the use of these fuels and
vehicles. The following is a list of current state programs in place:

•

10 percent target for renewable fuels;

•

PSC—RPS;

•

Florida Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act (FEECA);

•

2008 Florida Energy Bill (HB 7135);

•

Grants and incentives—DEP, Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services
(FDACS);

•

Workforce development;

•

Florida Water Star and related water conservation programs;

•

Best practices from other states and regions; and

•

The Florida Institute for Sustainable Energy (FISE) housed at the University of Florida.

GP‐5, Introduce Core Competencies Into Professional Licensing Programs, contains the
recommendation to “encourage professional organizations associated with building trades and
design professions to develop continuing education programs that include training directly
addressing new technologies and materials, and design, development, and construction
standards that can be used to reduce GHG emissions, improve energy efficiency, and reduce
dependence on fossil fuels.”
The following describes in general terms the classes of policies that are in place or proposed and
the opportunities and obstacles they face.

•

Improving energy efficiency in buildings and appliances: This type of reduction
represents a large grouping of negative‐cost recommendations and includes lighting
retrofits; improved heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; building
envelope and building control systems; and higher performance standards for consumer
and office electronics and appliances, among other options. While this category of

Appendix E – GP, 10-01-08

abatement options would cost the least from a societal point of view, persistent barriers to
market efficiency need to be overcome.

•

Increasing fuel efficiency in vehicles and reducing carbon intensity of transportation
fuels: Much of this form of GHG reduction would come from fuel economy packages (e.g.,
lightweight, aerodynamic, turbo‐charging, drive‐train efficiency, and reductions in rolling
resistance) and increased use of diesel for light‐duty vehicles (LDVs). Though the savings
from fuel efficiency may offset incremental costs of the abatement option over a vehicle’s 12‐
to 15‐year life cycle, these options require up‐front investment by automakers and, thus,
higher vehicle costs for consumers. Low‐carbon fuels, such as cellulosic biofuels, could
abate significant levels of GHG emissions (100–370 megatons, if undertaken nationally),
though this potential is highly dependent on innovation rates and near‐term
commercialization of these technologies. Plug‐in hybrid vehicles offer longer‐term potential
if vehicle cost and performance improves and the nation moves to a lower‐carbon electricity
supply.

•

Pursuing various options across energy‐intensive portions of the industrial sector: This
involves a multitude of fragmented opportunities within specific industries (e.g., equipment
upgrades and process changes) and across the sector (e.g., motor efficiency and combined
heat and power [CHP] applications). Despite offering direct bottom‐line benefit, these
options must compete for capital and, without clear incentives to control GHG emissions,
may not receive funding.

•

Expanding and enhancing carbon sinks: Increasing forest stocks and improving soil
management practices are relatively low‐cost options. Capturing them would require
linkages to carbon‐offset mechanisms to access needed capital plus improved monitoring
and verification.

•

Reducing the carbon intensity of electric power production: This potential derives from a
shift toward renewable energy sources (primarily wind and solar), additional nuclear
capacity, improved efficiency of power plants, and eventual use of carbon capture and
storage technologies on coal‐fired electricity generation. Options in the power sector are
among the most capital‐intensive. These options also tend to have the longest lead times,
given bottlenecks to permitting and materials and equipment manufacturing, as well as
design, engineering, and construction.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
All six statutory GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, and SF6) should be reduced.

GP-5. Introduce Core Competencies Into Professional Licensing Programs

Policy Description
Florida has more than 200,000 licensed built‐environment professionals, including building
contractors, architects, landscape architects, engineers, interior designers, and others involved
in the design and construction of Florida’s residential and commercial sites and buildings. All of
these professionals must earn continuing education units (CEUs) to maintain their licenses. In
addition to required CEUs, built‐environment professionals have access to rater and
certification training associated with certification programs such as the Home Energy Rating
System (HERS), U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design‐Accredited Professional (LEED‐AP), and the Florida Green Building
Council (FGBC). Additional training opportunities are available through Florida’s universities
and community colleges.
Many professional associations are already providing continuing education or educational
opportunities to their constituencies on climate change, GHG emissions, and energy efficiencies.
It is critical that Florida’s licensed professionals, who are responsible for the design,
development, and construction of Florida’s built environment, incorporate climate change and
energy efficient technologies, materials, and design into their projects to facilitate the reduction
of GHG emissions. Therefore, the state needs to establish and administer core competency
requirements for licensed professionals who provide site and architectural design, site
engineering, site construction, building construction, and building operations efficiencies
services. The state also needs to require professional organizations, in support of their
respective professional membership, to develop and administer continuing education programs
that specifically address new technologies, standards, and materials designed to reduce GHG
emissions and promote energy efficiency.
Additionally, within Florida’s university system, design and engineering programs should
establish required courses of study that specifically focus on the issues and importance of
climate change mitigation and energy efficiency toward establishing a sustainable Florida.

Policy Design
Introduce core competencies on climate change into professional licensing programs (e.g.,
energy efficiency in site and architectural design, engineering design, building construction,
operation and maintenance, use of recycled materials, use of local materials, and environmental
design practices).
Targeted professions should include

•

Architecture,

•

Interior design,

•

Civil engineering,

•

Environmental engineering,

•

Building inspectors,

•

Code compliance officers,

•

Building trades (e.g., plumbing and HVAC),

•

General contractors (site and building),

•

Real estate,

•

Building operators,

•

Landscape architecture, and

•

State‐certified teachers.

Specific climate change‐related questions will be added to the respective state licensure
examinations. To maintain professional licenses within the designated design professions, the
state will require the respective professional organizations to develop and administer
continuing education programs that reinforce the importance of reducing GHG emissions and
promoting energy efficiency.
In addition, the state will work with energy‐related certification and rater programs to promote
greater access to training and education for built‐environment professionals to enhance their
ability to effectively apply building science principles to reduce energy consumption and GHG
emissions.
To ensure that the state’s universities educate and prepare our future design and engineering
professionals about the urgency and importance of designing and developing for a sustainable
Florida, the state’s university design and engineering programs will develop and administer
required courses of study within the respective disciplines that specifically focus on the issues
and importance of GHG emission reduction, climate change mitigation, and energy efficiency.
The State of Florida will expand its relationship with professional associations, universities, and
other educational institutions to encourage and enable the development of curricula to carry out
this mandate.
Goals: To enhance the ability of licensed, built‐environment and design professionals to
effectively apply building science principles to reduce energy consumption, dependence upon
the use of fossil fuels, and GHG emissions.
To reduce energy consumption, dependence on the use of fossil fuels, and GHG emissions by
applying best practices of climate change mitigation and by ensuring that Florida’s licensed
professionals (who are largely responsible for the design, development, and construction of the
Florida built environment) are knowledgeable and current on GHG emission reduction and
climate change technologies, building materials and design, and development and construction

standards. Through ongoing education of licensed professionals, current and new technologies,
materials, design, and development and construction standards will be applied to new and
redeveloped projects in Florida’s communities.
Timing: By 2010, all professional license testing and exams for the professionals described
above shall be modified to address policies and best practices for reduction of GHG emisions
and energy efficiencies.
Parties Involved: Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR),
Workforce Florida, DEP, FECC, statewide professional organizations, local code enforcement
agencies, and state universities and community colleges. Involve the Conserve Florida
Clearinghouse, which was developed for improving water use efficiency in public water
supply, in the evaluation of building program measures to save energy.
Other: None.

Implementation Mechanisms
Mandate that State Boards of Licensing for building and design professionals include core
competencies on climate change in licensing exams. The exams should cover knowledge of the
improved building codes; energy performance requirements; energy efficient site and
architectural design; engineering design; building construction, maintenance, and operation;
use of recycled materials; use of local materials; and environmental design practices.
Encourage professional organizations associated with building trades and design professions to
develop continuing education programs that include training directly addressing new
technologies and materials, along with design, development, and construction standards that
can be used to reduce GHG emissions, improve energy efficiency, and reduce dependence on
fossil fuels.
Develop education and certification training programs for builders and contractors on efficient
heating and air conditioning sizing and installation.
Develop a Florida Green Building certification program for licensed professionals involved in
the design and construction of residential and commercial buildings and development sites.
(An example could be the Certified Green Building Professionals [CGBP] program administered
by Build It Green for California building professionals.)
Include required courses of study at the state universities and community colleges within the
respective disciplines that specifically focus on the issues surrounding and importance of GHG
emission reduction, climate change mitigation, energy efficiency improvements, and reduced
dependence on fossil fuels.

Related Policies/Programs in Place

Introduction
The Governor’s Action Team on Energy and Climate Change (Action Team) charged the
Adaptation Technical Working Group with providing two deliverables. The first deliverable
was an adaptation planning framework enumerating the multiple elements for which planning
should occur in order to better ready Florida for the changes likely to occur over the next
century as global mean temperatures increase consistent with the best available science from the
United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the National Academy of
Sciences, and other sources. Secondly, the Action Team charged the working group with
providing early policy actions related to climate change adaptation in advance of more
substantive policy development by the Florida Energy and Climate Commission using the
planning framework outlined here.
This technical appendix provides the planning template in the full detail as developed by the
Adaptation Technical Working Group. It also identifies early policy actions proposed by the
Technical Working Group and approved by the Action Team. These early policy actions are
denoted as “strategies.”

ADP-1. Advancing Science Data and Analysis Climate Change

Description of Issues
Florida is one of the most vulnerable areas in the world to the consequences of climate change,
especially sea level rise (SLR), and the possibility of increased hurricane activity.1 Regardless of
the underlying causes of climate change, glacial melting and expansion of warming oceans are
causing SLR, although the extent or rate for Florida cannot be predicted with certainty. In
addition, hurricane activity in the North Atlantic Basin has increased significantly in recent
years, but there is controversy over whether the primary cause is global warming or natural
weather cycles, making the long‐term trend indeterminate at this time. Not knowing which of
Florida’s barrier islands, floodplains, and what portions of major cities will be inundated, or
when are among the factors that make planning for adaptation to climate change difficult.
However, there is sufficient information to justify implementing many adaptations. Climate
change and the length of time needed to implement some adaptations further justify the need
for action in spite of these uncertainties. However, in all cases, adaptation should be guided by
good science.

Objectives
Scientific data, analyses, and predictive modeling are needed to understand how Florida’s
climate is likely to change, the consequences of change, and possible solutions. Focusing on four
key issues will help advance the science.

•

Reducing uncertainty in climate projections and enhancing predictive power of climate
models for Florida is critical, especially their temporal and spatial resolution. Improving
models requires addressing considerations specific to Florida: strong marine influence and
peninsula effect; the wide climate gradient from the temperate northern region to
subtropical southern region of the state; lack of long‐term physical climate measurements
for historical trends (although some proxies are available); huge climate variability;
complicating effects of the interaction of land‐use change (e.g., wetland loss); and climate
change.

•

Given climate modeling limitations for Florida, the current planning template focuses on
SLR and the potential for increasing hurricane strength. Scientific data and analyses to
predict other potential effects of global warming that could affect Florida are still extremely
underdeveloped. There is no data available at this time that adequately assess potential
effects, such as increased drought, wildfires, flooding, and invasive species. Until models
improve, appropriate risk management and adaptive management will be challenging.

•

Recognize that adaptability refers to the ability of humans to manage the resilience and
capacity of the system (e.g., ecological, economic, social) to absorb the disturbance of climate
change. Our science needs to address three crucial aspects of resilience: the amount of
change Florida can withstand before switching over to another state or condition from
which it cannot recover its former function, the ease or difficulty of making changes, and
how close the current system is to a switching threshold.

•

Improving our understanding of socioeconomic responses to alternative climate predictions
will better guide public policy and incentive programs. New approaches and tools, such as
agent‐based models (ABMs) will provide a better framework to examine interactions of
socioeconomic and climate change.

Assets at Risk
Not applicable.

Existing Actions
House Bill (HB) 7135, passed in the 2008 Legislative Session, directly addressed collecting and
acquiring better emissions data, as well as ensuring improved analysis of all emissions data.
Among other actions, the bill created the Florida Energy Systems Consortium (FESC) as a
“supercenter of excellence” within the State University System (SUS) to better coordinate
energy‐related research in support of Florida’s energy and climate change policy objectives. The
bill did not address research that can support adaptation.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Provide a measurable outcome and scientific evaluation for each of the goals and
strategies outlined in the Adaptation Policy Options to assess whether they have been met.
Evaluation should be science‐based, using the complementary skills of climate scientists,
ecologists, hydrologists, social scientists, and economists. Test programs and pilots to measure
and assess alternative outcomes are encouraged.
Strategy A: HB 7135 in the 2008 Florida Legislative Session created the FESC as a
“supercenter of excellence” within the SUS. The center should consider, as a priority order
of business, the appointment of a scientific advisory council composed of members from
identified disciplines which are relevant to adaptation to climate change and representatives
of each participating institution to better coordinate research in support of Florida’s
adaptation and climate change policy objectives.
Strategy B: The Florida Energy and Climate Research Trust Fund should be created by the
Legislature and a dedicated revenue stream should be provided.
Goal 2: Foster and support a climate science research agenda for Florida with broad priorities as
outlined below. Consider instituting a new scientific advisory council on climate change to

F‐4
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
advise state government on this research agenda. Identify and establish long‐term funding to
support research. Funding should be protected from short‐term economic or political cycles.
Strategy A: HB 7135 in the 2008 Florida Legislative Session created the Florida Energy
Systems Consortium as a “super center of excellence” within the State University System.
The center should consider, as a priority order of business, the appointment of a scientific
advisory council composed of members from identified disciplines adaptive to climate
change and representative of each participating institution to better coordinate research in
support of Florida’s adaptation and climate change policy objectives.
Strategy B: The Florida Energy and Climate Research Trust Fund should be created by the
Legislature, and a dedicated revenue stream should be provided.
Goal 3: Conduct research needed to support incorporation of climate change into the protection
of Florida’s ecosystems and biodiversity.
Strategy A: Calculate the economic value and services provided by Florida’s natural
communities and associated species to inform decisions regarding state budget and policy
requirements. Disseminate information broadly.
Strategy B: Define the likely new “states” of Florida ecological systems to determine state
budget and policy requirements. Identify species and habitats that are not likely to migrate
naturally and craft strategies to assist migration or re‐create habitat elsewhere to facilitate
this shift.
Strategy C: Expand the newly developed Critical Lands & Waters Identification Project
(CLIP) v1.0 database to incorporate impacts and adaptation to climate change. CLIP
updates, unifies, and prioritizes existing geographic information systems (GIS) databases.
Completed July 1, 2008, CLIP identifies and prioritizes statewide natural resource
landscapes, biodiversity, and water and serves as a starting point for the Cooperative
Conservation Blueprint project.
Goal 4: Enhance support for mapping, monitoring, and modeling will be necessary to provide
information to support policy making. For example, the state is supporting use of light
detection and ranging (LIDAR) to improve mapping of Florida’s coastlines. Such mapping
should be done for the entire coastline of the state. In addition, effective monitoring programs
are needed to detect impacts of climate change, as well as modeling to better project impacts.
Strategy: Create a new center to coordinate and align data from proxy data sets to build a
more precise picture of climate change in Florida over the last few thousand years and
predict the effects of climate change in the future. This data center could also track
associated responses in vegetation, sea level, and disturbances such as fire.

______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 5: Support projection of climate change at smaller scales to forecast state and local impacts
and to pinpoint risks.
Goal 6: Collaborate to the greatest extent possible with other similar research efforts by the
federal government, the private sector, and non‐state research institutions and universities.

Priorities for Further Research and Analysis
A number of plans and proposals for research that will support adaptation to climate change,
among other things, have been published, including the “Annual Science and Research Plan”
prepared by the Florida Oceans and Coastal Research Council and “A Strategic Implementation
Plan for Florida COOS: 2008–2010” written by the Florida Coastal Ocean Observing System
(FLCOOS). Such plans can be consulted for specific ideas on research that will enhance Florida’s
ability to manage marine and coastal resources vulnerable to climate variability and change. It
is not known whether there is an integrated research priority list counterpart to this for
Florida’s terrestrial and freshwater systems; one research priority might be to initiate such a
process and to cross‐reference these lists for areas of synergy.
There are already a number of cross‐cutting priorities for research and analysis that Florida
should consider, including the following:

•

Emphasize collaborations with international climate scientists, to refine climate predictions
for Florida. The state, in partnership with federal agencies, international efforts, and Florida
universities, should (a) undertake review of current studies and models, (b) consider
updating model development to more precisely forecast changes in Florida’s weather
patterns, and (c) undertake specific analysis of uncertainties and contingencies in climate
scenarios for Florida.

•

Place special emphasis on establishing or enhancing programs to follow developments
regarding the climate‐related impacts of SLR and hurricane activity, considering that
Florida is particularly vulnerable to potential impacts.

•

Establish or enhance existing programs to monitor and determine trends in other climate‐
related impacts that could have consequences in Florida including increased drought,
wildfires, flooding, storm water runoff, heat waves, problems with invasive species and
insect‐borne disease resulting from changes in temperature and rainfall regimes, adverse
effects on native terrestrial species, natural communities and marine life, saltwater intrusion
into aquifers, more frequent and intense storms, storm surges, tidal regimes, and coastal
erosion. Build a decision support structure to guide and prioritize an ongoing Florida‐
specific research agenda.

•

Deploy a “Florida Land and Sea Mesonet” to serve as a world‐class network of integrated
environmental monitoring stations, drawing from and contributing to existing terrestrial
and marine networks, capitalizing and building on deployed meteorological stations,
evapotranspiration (ET) stations, micro‐meteorology towers, flow gauges and well/aquifer

______________________________________________________________________________
monitoring, and other critical monitoring networks to meticulously track changes in
Florida’s climate and hydrology and fill gaps in statewide network coverage. The existing
FLCOOS should include climate impacts.

•

Support scientists working on availability of remote sensing data and methods for gathering
it to provide actual continuous statewide coverage (and for coverage of the associated
surrounding oceanographic area of influence), with consistent spatial grids and
measurements, for common inputs for climate and hydrologic models.

•

Link climate scientists with ecologists, economists, and social scientists. Issue a request for
proposal (RFP) from interdisciplinary teams of social scientists, economists, and climate
scientists to build interactive models that include non‐linearities and feedbacks to better
predict Florida’s responses to anticipated changes. ABMs are appropriate here because of
the complexity of climate change models and responses.

•

Build socioeconomic models to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative incentives and
policies. Select pilot areas and locations in the state to test policy programs. Evaluate
effectiveness of adaptation strategies at regular intervals

•

Build better decision tools to incorporate total cost accounting for local and regional
planning decisions, so that proposed land‐use changes, agricultural policy shifts, water‐use
policies, transportation decisions, siting of major new industries, and other changes will
have a full assessment of all public costs, including the likely carbon or greenhouse gas
(GHG) footprint and water use. Decision tools should also include assessments of proposals
for land‐use changes in light of the predicted climate changes.

ADP-2. Comprehensive Planning

Description of Issues
Florida has an integrated planning process that local, state, and regional governments can use to
prepare plans that direct future growth and development, conservation of natural resources,
and provision of public facilities. Under state law, planning in Florida is guided by standards
that require a consistent policy direction and coordination among plans.
The framework for the integrated planning process starts with Florida’s State Comprehensive
Plan (SCP), which contains goals and policies that set broad directions on energy, land use, and
other issues relevant to future adaptation to climate change. At the state level, there is a
transportation plan and a water plan. At the regional level, there are 11regional planning
councils (RPCs), each of which has adopted a strategic policy plan. In addition, at the regional
level, there are five water management districts (WMDs) and seven transportation districts,
each with planning documents that guide programs and decision making. At the local level,
each county and municipality in Florida has adopted a comprehensive plan that includes goals,
objectives, and policies that address future land use, conservation, coastal management (where
applicable), transportation, public facilities, parks and recreation, housing, intergovernmental
coordination, and capital improvements. Local land development regulations and permits must
be consistent with the comprehensive plan.
The 2008 Florida Legislature amended the SCP to address GHG reduction strategies with
attention to facilities that generate electrical power. The 2008 requirements for local
comprehensive plans represent an important initial step but are oriented more toward energy
use and GHG emission reductions than on adaptation to changing climatic conditions.

Objectives
Chapter 187 of the Florida Statutes requires that, “The State Comprehensive Plan shall provide
long‐range policy guidance for the orderly social, economic, and physical growth of the state.”
It also states that the plan is a “direction setting document” that should be “reasonably applied
where they are economically and environmentally feasible, not contrary to the public interest,
and consistent with the protection of private property rights.”
Florida’s local, state, and regional comprehensive plans should be amended, based on best
available data, to include goals, objectives, and policies that will prepare the state for adapting
to the future impacts of climate change, such as SLR. Future policies should use incentives to
encourage desired actions, including encouragement not to repeat past decisions that will leave
new development exposed to SLR and other climate change consequences.

Assets at Risk
Florida may be one of the states most at risk to climate change. It is surrounded by water on
three sides, and its relatively flat terrain means that large areas of the coast are at risk of
inundation from SLR or coastal storm exposure, particularly tropical storms and hurricanes.
SLR will affect Florida’s valuable shoreline resources, including the beach, coastal vegetation
and habitat, and significant public and private built investment. Decisions will need to be made
about relocation, redevelopment and, where appropriate, retreat from the shoreline.
The projected consequences from climate change, such as SLR, may lead to future questions
about reducing risks in hazard‐prone areas and areas that could face increased risks under
climate change as well as the rights of private property owners and the police power and
trusteeship responsibilities of state and local governments to protect the community at large.
These issues will likely be focused on private property adjacent to the beach and in low‐lying
areas subject to increased flooding. All these issues must be considered while planning for
future growth, because between now and 2030, the state will need to develop residential,
commercial, and retail areas to serve twice our current population.

Existing Actions
Governor Crist created the Florida Energy and Climate Change Action Team through executive
order. That Action Team has appointed Technical Work Groups (TWGs) to address these issues.
One TWG is reviewing the state’s Transportation and Land Use (TLU) planning in particular,
and the Government Policy (GP) TWG is addressing these issues as well.
The 2008 Florida Legislature passed HB 7135, which created the Florida Energy and Climate
Commission (FECC). The FECC will continue the work of the Action Team and consider and
coordinate certain recommended Action Team adaptations to the land‐use planning process.
The bill also amended Section 339.175, Florida Statutes, to encourage metropolitan planning
organizations (MPOs) to consider GHG emissions in their planning processes.

ADP-2.1 Local Government Level
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Ensure that all relevant elements of local government comprehensive plans (e.g., future
land use, coastal zone management, and capital facilities) are updated to reflect the best
available data and strategies for adapting to future climate change impacts.
Strategy A: The Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) should work with the
FECC to create a phase‐in formula requiring future updating of local plans through the
Evaluation and Appraisal Process (EAR).

F‐9
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Strategy B: The FECC and DCA will recommend to the Florida legislature new authority to
provide necessary direction for local government comprehensive plans to address the range
of adaptation actions, including built environment, anticipated from climate change
impacts.
Goal 2: State and regional agencies should provide financial and technical assistance to local
governments to ensure timely updates of local plans.
Strategy A: Update the climate change section of the DCA Planning Tools Web site with
adaptation information from the Action Team and other sources.
Strategy B: Tie state and regional agencies into a broadly available state digital database
focused on climate change and ensure that all pertinent state records are digitized to
provide local government planners with instant access to the information they need to better
consider the impacts of updates to local plans.
Goal 3: Counties and municipalities located within each county should collaborate to create
working groups (e.g., Miami‐Dade County Climate Change Advisory Task Force) to study their
comprehensive plans and recommend changes that better address adaptation to local climate
change.
Goal 4: Local governments should review elements of their coastal management plans to
determine whether there are any amendments that could make their coastal areas (especially
the coastal high‐hazard areas) more resilient to the impacts of climate change, including SLR.
Strategy A: Amend Chapter 163.3178 (8), to provide for coastal counties to include SLR as a
criterion when prioritizing lands for acquisition through state programs.
Strategy B: Create a best practices manual for local governments to use that incorporates
risk from SLR when identifying coastal lands for state acquisition using new adaptation
language incorporated into local, state, and regional government land acquisition processes.
Strategy C: Identify and revise statutory direction for local, state, and regional planning
processes to identify potential within planning areas, particularly coastal areas, for SLR.
Provide for an assessment of

•

The potential movement of the coastal construction control line and related changes,

•

The extent and potential for expansion of floodplains, and

•

Habitat and wildlife migration potentials.

Strategy D: DEP, DCA, and the state’s RPCs should jointly develop, assess, and recommend
a suite of planning tools and climate change adaptation strategies for local governments so
they can maximize opportunities to protect the beach/dune system, coastal wetlands, and
F‐10

other coastal resources in an era of rising seas. The tools should include strategies to
encourage the landward siting and relocation of structures and public facilities in areas
adjacent to receding shorelines through acquisition, rolling easements, transfer of
development rights, stronger setbacks, and tax incentives.

ADP-2.2 Regional Government Level
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: RPCs should update their Strategic Regional Policy Plans (SRPPs) to reflect important
regional issues concerning adaptation to the impacts of climate change.
Strategy: DCA, RPCs, and the FECC should agree on guidance in the DCA‐RPC annual
contracts that directs how adaptation language is to be made part of the SRPPs.
Goal 2: WMDs should modify regional water supply plans and other regional water
management activities to include adaptation measures that address impacts from climate
change.
Strategy: DEP, the five WMDs, and the FECC should agree on future guidance for updating
regional water supply plans and other water management activities to ensure that they
address adaptation to climate change impacts such as SLR.

ADP-2.3 State Government Level
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: The SCP and comprehensive plans of other relevant state agencies should be updated to
reflect future actions that promote adaptation measures that address the impacts from climate
change.
Strategy A: The Governor, acting as Chief Planning Officer of the state, should direct the
Office of Planning and Budget to work with the FECC, state and regional agencies, local
governments, special districts, and interested parties to propose changes to the SCP that
address climate change adaptation for review by the Legislature.
Strategy B: The SCP, Chapter 187.201(8), Coastal and Marine Resources, goals and policies
should be amended to address adaptation to the consequences of climate change.
Strategy C: The DCA should explore using the Areas of Critical State Concern Program as a
way to provide special assistance in planning and redevelopment for areas of the state at
high risk of change due to SLR.

F‐11

______________________________________________________________________________
Strategy D: The Florida Division of Emergency Management (DEM) should incorporate SLR
and increasing storm surge impacts into its efforts to remap potential hazard areas in coastal
zones. Revised hazard area designations should better reflect the risks to communities
associated with climate change and allow reevaluation of suitability for development in
these areas.
Goal 2: The FECC should encourage cooperation at all levels of government and recommend
additional goals and strategies to ensure that adequate measures are taken to adapt to future
impacts from climate change.
Goal 3: A balance should be achieved between protecting property rights and protecting
communities and natural resources.
Strategy A: The Office of the Florida Attorney General should monitor state, regional, and
local actions to address the impacts of climate change for potential conflicts between private
property rights and the government’s responsibilities to protect its communities, natural
resources and public usage and access to government lands. Specific attention should be
given to possible conflicts with the individual rights of private landowners who are affected
by sea level rise, beach erosion, and other impacts of climate change. The Attorney General
should issue a report with recommendations every five years.

ADP-3. Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity

Description of Issues
Florida’s terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems extend from temperate north Florida to
subtropical south Florida. Many tropical species are at their northern range limits in Florida;
many temperate species are at their southern limits. The result is a highly diverse, unique
assemblage of species and, in terrestrial and freshwater systems, many species which occur only
in Florida. Florida has 1,350 miles of coast that is home to a diverse array of marine and coastal
natural communities and associated species, including the world’s third largest fringing barrier
reef and a barrier island system that provides a great amount of habitat diversity.
The State of Florida has the third highest number of species in the United States (more than
5,000), of which approximately 670 occur only in Florida. Its approximately 4,000 native and
exotic plant species are distributed over 81 plant communities. According to the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service (US FWS), 114 species are listed as endangered or threatened (2008), including
the West Indian manatee, green sea turtle, and brown pelican.
Florida’s upland ecosystems are characterized by temperate climate, dry soils, and gently
sloping, forested hills. The dominant plant species in dry uplands include pines and oaks. Plant
species in the wetter uplands include southern magnolia, beech, spruce pine, Shumard oak,
Florida maple, and other hardwoods. Coastal uplands feature sandy soils, and their plant
communities consist of sea oats and mixed salt‐spray‐tolerant grasses, shrubs, and herbs.
Florida’s freshwater ecosystems include wetlands, streams, lakes, and ponds. Coastal wetlands
and swamps are generally inundated with freshwater but are subject to tidal cycles and are
saltwater‐tolerant.
Wetlands cover approximately 30 percent of the State of Florida and play an important role in
flood protection. Streams can vary from seasonal to permanent waterways, and plant species
generally grow along stream edges.
Beaches, as Florida’s primary tourism attraction, are one of the state’s most important economic
engines, generating tens of billions of dollars in annual revenues through jobs, tourism,
recreation, and taxes. Beach‐related tourism has a $41.6 billion annual impact on Florida’s
economy. In addition, over 25 percent of the value of Florida’s coastal real estate can be
attributed to beaches.2

______________________________________________________________________________
A healthy beach/dune system provides protection for upland property and infrastructure and
increases a beach’s resiliency (for example, its ability to recover from storm events). Florida’s
beach/dune system also provides important habitat for marine turtles, shorebirds, beach mice,
invertebrates, and other species. Currently, more than half of Florida’s 825 miles of sandy
beaches are experiencing chronic erosion, and about 42 percent are designated as critically
eroding (meaning they need long‐term maintenance in order to ensure protection of vulnerable
upland properties, recreational interests, wildlife habitat, or important cultural resources).
Reefs are affected by disease and bleaching. In addition, overfishing, polluted runoff, and
reduced freshwater inflows also threaten the health of marine ecosystems. The state is making
an effort to establish marine sanctuaries to protect its marine ecosystem from further damage.
Species found here include seabirds, dolphins, whales, and manatees, as well as many types of
invertebrates, crustaceans, and fishes (e.g., bony fishes, sharks, skates, rays, and eels).
Alligators, crocodiles, and turtles can also be found in this area. Habitats include sea grass beds,
sandy bottoms, reefs, and open ocean.
These natural resources provide many economic benefits to Florida. For example, 4.2 million
people participated in some form of residential or nonresidential wildlife viewing in Florida in
2006, with related total retail sales estimated at $3.1 billion ($2.4 billion by residents and $653.3
million by nonresidents) for that period.

Objectives
The Florida Constitution calls for the “management, protection, and conservation of wild
animal life and freshwater aquatic life.” Florida law notes that the “State of Florida harbors a
wide diversity of fish and wildlife and that it is the policy of this state to conserve and wisely
manage these resources” and calls the state to “protect and acquire unique natural habitats and
ecological systems…and restore degraded natural systems to a functional condition.” With
regard to coastal and marine resources, the “development and marine resource use and beach
access improvements in coastal areas do not endanger public safety or important natural
resources.”
Managing ecosystems for resilience enhances their ability to naturally adapt to the stresses of
climate change and other pervasive threats. Specifically, good management should:

•

Maximize the resilience of species and habitats to climate change impacts by minimizing
other human induced threats;

•

Facilitate and maintain the persistence of coastal ecosystems and the ecological and human
services they provide;

•

Increase understanding of how Florida’s marine and coastal ecosystems may migrate and
change because of climate change;

•

Identify areas, natural communities, and species of particular ecological vulnerability;

F‐14
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Protect natural communities vulnerable to SLR from loss resulting from shoreline hardening
and other actions that prevent or inhibit natural upslope migration;

•

Identify and secure paths for other inland habitats to migrate with changes in temperature,
rainfall patterns, and groundwater levels; and

•

Protect inland natural communities from competing climate change adaptation pressures,
such as the landward relocation of coastal development, human demands for ground and
surface water, and engineered solutions for flood mitigation.

Specific objectives for beaches include ensuring the long‐term protection of the beach/dune
system and preserving its ecological functions as well as:

•

Considering how climate change could be incorporated into all aspects of the beach
management and coastal construction regulatory programs.

•

Developing policies to discourage development adjacent to eroding shorelines and
encouraging the placement of structures and infrastructure away from retreating shorelines;
these measures may reduce future reliance on coastal bulkheading, which can accelerate
beach loss.

•

Purchasing private coastal lands that have been strategically targeted to provide buffers for
retreating shorelines, to preserve and protect habitats and ecosystem function, and to
increase the resiliency of the shoreline to recover from storm events.

•

Enhancing communication on coastal resource protection between and within state
regulatory agencies, such as DCA and DEP, can ensure more efficient use of resources and
expertise in developing adaptation responses and strategies.

Assets at Risk
Temperature, rainfall, sea level, and ocean chemistry play critical roles in determining where
individual species of plants and animals can live, grow, and reproduce. The effects of climate
change on species and ecosystems can be direct and indirect. Climate change will change the
structure and composition of ecosystems and communities; coastal and estuarine habitats;
ocean chemistry (lower pH levels adversely affect growth of corals, shellfish, and some algae);
geographic range of species; timing of species’ life cycles, which may become out of sync with
other species they depend on; plant growth, nutrient composition, plant‐animal interactions,
and ecosystem nutrient cycles; and the intensity and magnitude of existing stresses, such as
invasive species and wildfire regimes, on biodiversity and ecosystem structures, functions, and
processes. In addition, climate change is also projected to result in increased risk of extinction
for some species (e.g., those with limited dispersal capabilities or those that live in specialized
habitats) and opportunity for range expansion of invasive species.
SLR and other predicted impacts of climate change (e.g., increases in frequency and intensity of
coastal storms and higher storm surges) increase beach erosion, shoreline recession, and barrier

migration and have a profound impact on Florida’s beaches, the beach‐using public, and the
tourism industry.
As beaches erode and recede, many of the values and benefits they provide are threatened. In
addition, public access to lands held in trust for the public, including the wet sand beach and
near shore‐submerged lands, is greatly diminished. Conflicts over public usage and private
property rights will likely increase as beaches recede and the area of dry sand beach decreases.

Existing Actions
DEP includes in its annual “Florida Forever Work Plan” a list of lands that sequester carbon,
provide habitat, protect coastal lands or barrier islands, and otherwise mitigate and help adapt
to the effects of SLR. DEP’s Office of Coastal and Aquatic Managed Areas (CAMA) has 42
aquatic preserves around the state that are managed to protect natural values. CAMA also co‐
manages with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) the Florida Keys
National Marine Sanctuary, and three National Estuarine Research Reserves. The Florida Fish
and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) overseas the Florida Wildlife Legacy Initiative;
which includes major terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems and strives to keep common
species common. In addition, DEP (state parks), (DOF), the Florida Fish and Wildlife
Conservation Commission (FWC), and other state agencies have ongoing programs to maintain
natural systems in a healthy state. On a parallel track, federal and local governments and
private organizations, such as The Nature Conservancy and the Audubon Society, maintain
parks, and natural areas.

ADP-3.1 Uplands, Freshwater and Marine Systems
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: A representative portfolio of Florida’s terrestrial, freshwater, and marine natural
communities with redundant representation of habitats and species and connecting corridors
(e.g., Florida’s Biodiversity Blueprint) is protected and well managed in a manner that
maximizes the health and resilience of these systems to climate change impacts.
Strategy A: Tie into existing and expanded databases such as CLIP to examine existing
local, state, regional, and federal land holdings and categorize these holdings with regard to
the representative portfolio.
Strategy B: Provide an accessible, expanded, and updated database to track changes to the
natural communities and corridors.
Strategy C: The FECC should consider the recommendations for biodiversity and ecosystem
adaptation to climate change developed through the Florida’s Wildlife: On the Frontlines of
Climate Change summit.

______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 2: Acquire and appropriately manage lands needed to complete critical south‐to‐north
migration corridors to accommodate range changes in species and natural communities driven
by climate change.
Goal 3: Important natural communities vulnerable to SLR (e.g., intertidal and coastal habitats)
are buffered or protected (from shoreline stabilization and hardening) to maximize the
probability of their persistence into the future.
Strategy A: DEP and other relevant agencies should develop state wetlands conservation
and restoration plans that clearly designate wetland migration corridors as the sea level
rises.
Strategy B: The Legislature should place a priority on coastal land acquisition through the
Florida Forever program, a separate dedicated funding source, or through other means.
Greater incentives should be provided to local governments and private organizations to
acquire and manage ecologically important coastal lands, including upland buffers.
Acquisition efforts should be strategically targeted to protect coastal resources, reduce
insured risk, and reduce the impacts of climate change on both ecosystems and
communities.
Goal 4: Areas that may serve as refuges for at‐risk species are identified, prioritized, protected,
and managed in a manner that maximizes the persistence of at‐risk species.
Goal 5: Enact legislation to define newly submerged lands contiguous to existing state aquatic
preserves, parks, and others as part of the contiguous state‐managed areas.
Goal 6: Establish an integrated network of early warning sites on protected lands to track long‐
term changes in biological communities and processes; establish a Center for Climate Archives
for baseline and associated data.

ADP-3.2 Beaches and Beach Management
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Reduce and discourage future reliance on bulkheading/hardening to stabilize estuarine
and beach shorelines. Shoreline hardening should be considered only after a full and
cumulative assessment of short‐ and long‐term impacts to coastal resources and coastal
ecosystems.
Strategy A: Address local, state, and regional permitting programs and planning elements
to fully assess and consider potential impacts and changes to coastal resources and
ecosystems from proposed coastal protection measures in light of potential impacts of
climate change.

F‐17

______________________________________________________________________________
Strategy B: Add an overview element to state and regional planning documents describing
statewide strategies and circumstances for coastal and shoreline retreat and erosion.
Strategy C: The state should undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the Coastal
Construction Control Line Program to ensure that it is accomplishing its intended goal of
protection of the beach and dune system. The reevaluation should consider, among other
things, the adequacy of existing coastal setbacks, building siting and design requirements,
and post‐storm redevelopment policies in light of SLR scenarios.
Goal 2: Estimate the ecological value of beach resources around the state in order to give the
highest priority to protecting beach resources with the highest ecological values.
Goal 3: Minimize conditions inhibiting natural long‐shore sand movement to reduce coastal
erosion, protect existing investment in and reduce the future need for beach re‐nourishment,
and increase beach system resiliency.
Strategy: DEP should be funded to support the design and implementation of inlet
management plans for all of the state’s modified inlets and should undertake all reasonable
efforts to maximize inlet sand bypassing.
Goal 4: Require the state Acquisition and Restoration Council conduct a review of management
plans for those lands under its authority every 10 years and include property‐specific analyses
of vulnerability to climate change in each management plan.
Strategy: Consider a Full Disclosure Law that alerts buyers of coastal property about
erosion rates, storm history, SLR concerns, and other relevant information.
Goal 5: State and local governments establish policies and regulations that clearly define when,
how, where, and under what circumstances emergency beach stabilization is allowed.
Goal 6: State and local governments establish policies and regulations that address coastal
retreat and at what point vulnerable structures will have to be abandoned.
Goal 7: State and local governments establish policies and regulations to protect coastal
resources from contamination resulting from inundation, structural failure, or abandonment of
residential, industrial, and municipal assets resulting from SLR or storm events.
Goal 8: Ensure that the state’s beach management program can accomplish its intended goals,
including the long‐term protection and resiliency of the beach/dune system, in an era of climate
change and rising seas.
Strategy: DEP’s Strategic Beach Management Plan should incorporate a range of sea level
rise scenarios over at least a 50 year time horizon.

Goal 9: Provide incentives to encourage public and local governments to site structures and
infrastructure away from areas at high risk from the impacts of climate change and SLR.
Strategy: See ADP 2.1, Goal 4, Strategy D

ADP-3.3 Species Protection
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: The vulnerability of Florida’s fish and wildlife to climate change impacts is assessed, the
most vulnerable species are identified, and plans are prepared to enhance their chances of
persistence where there is a reasonable likelihood that the species will persist over the next
50 years.
Strategy A: Utilize the CLIP and similar expanded and centralized digital databases to
determine potential species and habitat vulnerability.
Strategy B: Incorporate species and habitat vulnerability from climate change into state and
regional planning/zoning, government land acquisition, or determinations for conservation
easements.
Goal 2: Put in place a system for monitoring how Florida’s natural communities and associated
species are responding to climate change impacts and widely distribute the results of this
monitoring to all interested stakeholders.
Goal 3: Consider how climate change affects the nexus between species and habitat and act to
protect habitat for vulnerable species in light of additional risks posed by climate change.
Goal 4: Evaluate likely persistence of Florida’s rare species, natural communities, coastal
ecosystem, and parks and protected areas under climate change.
Strategy: Conduct a review of required management plans for public parks, forests, and
wildlife areas every 10 years and include analyses of vulnerability to climate change for each
area.

ADP-4. Water Resource Management

Description of Issues
The State of Florida is currently facing many water resource management challenges, including
shortages due to drought, saltwater intrusion, and deterioration in quality and limits on the
availability of its groundwater sources. The system is stressed even further by continued
pressures from population growth, development styles, and potential new challenges resulting
from climate change. Although there are uncertainties about climate change, water managers
must nonetheless plan for potential increased variability in precipitation regimes, storm events,
and rising sea levels. Significant changes in these phenomena are likely to result in changes to
the amount of freshwater resources and land available to sustain life and maintain healthy
water‐dependent natural systems.
While Florida’s extensive coastline provides a unique ability to tap saltwater as a future water
source, primary water resource concerns revolve around changes to water‐dependent
ecosystems, impacts to and from human activity, and the quality of groundwater and surface
water. There may be shifts in water demands for agricultural and municipal supply; increased
energy consumption for advanced water treatment, transmission, and disposal; and changing
environmental needs.
The rate of climate change and potential consequences over the next 100 years is uncertain, but
the more rapid the rate of change, the more quickly Floridians will have to respond to manage
Florida’s water resources effectively. Planning and action now may significantly reduce the cost
of deferring action.

Objectives
Local, state, and regional policies to protect groundwater and other water resources are
designed to ensure adequate supplies to meet the needs of humans and the environment.
Policies and measures to encourage conservation, protect existing supplies, identify and
develop new supplies, and further invest in innovative technologies to treat water will be
needed. Florida recognizes four areas of responsibility (AOR) critical to water resource
management, as expressed in Chapter 373, Florida Statutes.
1. Water Supply—Managing water resources to ensure that there are adequate supplies for
current and future Floridians.
2. Water Quality—Implementing measures to ensure that changes to existing landscapes
will not cause degradation of existing groundwater and surface water quality.
3. Flood Protection—Identifying and protecting flood‐prone areas to minimize the risk of
floods to human activities through structural and non‐structural means.
F‐21
Appendix F

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
4. Natural Systems Protection—Managing water and related land resources to ensure that
there are supplies of adequate quantity and quality to protect and maintain healthy natural
systems.
In order for Floridians to have adequate freshwater supplies available to meet basic reasonable
and beneficial needs and the requirements of natural systems, these principles should be
followed:

•

Intense conservation of all water uses and alternative water sources will need to play a
larger role in meeting Florida’s future water needs.

•

Provide for stakeholder involvement in statewide and regional water supply planning
processes.

•

Incorporate methods to quantify and plan for uncertainties and risks related to
population growth, climate change, and environmental regulations.

It is important that the five water management districts have consistent and coordinated water
policies to address climate change.

Assets at Risk
The majority of Florida’s population and the water infrastructure to serve them reside within 50
miles of the coast. The Florida population is projected to increase by an additional 50 percent by
2030. In addition to new infrastructure required to develop and distribute water supplies to
meet the needs of that growing population, existing coastal and groundwater resources may be
at risk due to saltwater intrusion and SLR. Additional consumptive use of freshwater will
further diminish the head of pressure needed to stave off saltwater intrusion.
Florida could face rising seas, decreased precipitation, and more intense storms. These three
currently predicted impacts alone could have serious implications for Florida’s major areas of
water resource responsibility.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Identify and quantify the vulnerabilities and reliability of existing water supplies to
potential effects of differing climate change scenarios with emphasis on source water
availability and quality.
Strategy A: Develop an inventory of water supply facilities (source, storage, treatment, and
distribution) and conduct a study to develop different climate change scenarios and
potential impacts and adaptation strategies for high‐risk utilities.
Strategy B: DEP, water management districts, and local and regional staff should evaluate
and prepare for relocation and/or protection of drinking water well fields and groundwater
recharge areas from saltwater intrusion.

______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 2: Develop regional and statewide water demand projection scenarios that account for
potential changes in (1) agricultural demand due to changes in the growing season or impacts
on crop production; (2) municipal and industrial demand as temperatures increase and drought
(seasonal or intra‐annual) persists; and (3) water demand for energy generation due to possible
changes in fuel sources over a 100‐year planning horizon, with consideration for Florida’s
statutory obligation to provide water for the environment.
Strategy A: DEP, water management districts, and local and regional planners must
evaluate and implement maximum wastewater treatment and reuse options to optimize
drinking water and water for the environment and other beneficial uses.
Goal 3: Develop conservation programs that address and incentivize water and energy usage
efficiencies.
Goal 4: Encourage water reuse.
Goal 5: Implement local, state, and regional water supply planning processes that quantify
potential changes in existing water supplies and identify potential new water sources, including
synergies between flood management structures and water supply. Promote coordination
across jurisdictions within and across watersheds as appropriate. Incorporate methodologies
that use not only historic hydrologic data, but also consider changes that may result from
climate change and prioritize water for natural systems.
Goal 6: Integrate land‐use considerations, flood management, and storm‐water best
management practices (BMPs) designed to protect water quality, water demand/supply
management, and water reservations for the environment in watershed planning and design
standards.
Goal 7: Incorporate methods that consider energy, environmental, and economic sustainability
when evaluating potential water management strategies (e.g., in developing new surface water
supplies or desalination projects).
Goal 8: Change monitoring compliance with minimum flows and levels and
water/consumptive use permits, how structures are operated, and when alternative supplies
sources are needed.
Goal 9: Change the basis for current Environmental Resource Permits (ERPs), watershed and
water quality modeling, structural operations, and other flood management methodologies.
Goal 10: Address water quality changes and flooding of coastal and tidally influenced bodies of
water that may occur due to more intense storms, higher surface water temperatures, and rising
sea levels on coastal aquifers.

______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 11: Increase freshwater pressure to offset SLR, retain as much freshwater in natural
systems as is reasonable, and restore previously drained systems.
Goal 12: Redesign as necessary coastal recovery strategies, coastal restoration projects, coastal
land acquisition, and other measures to allow for natural adaptations and movement inland.
Goal 13: Protect and maintain the natural mosaic of ecosystems, such as upland and lowland
interfaces, to ensure the health of water and related natural resources.
Goal 14: Allow coastal estuaries, riverine, and other water dependent ecosystems to migrate or
adapt to maintain healthy wildlife and fish populations consistent with new climate regimes.
Goal 15: Well fields, surface or subsurface storage facilities, and water treatment plants may be
vulnerable. Siting and plans for new facilities should be closely examined to mitigate impacts or
locate the facilities to reduce risks from increased winds and flooding.

ADP-5. Built Environment, Infrastructure, and Community Protection

Definition of Issues
The built environment can be defined as the aggregate of all buildings, facilities, and structures
designed and built to provide shelter or to house the full breadth of human activity, as well as
the infrastructure designed and built to supports or protect such human activity.
The conjugation of these factors has resulted in more than 70 percent of the population living in
coastal counties, and perhaps close to 85 percent of the built environment (on the basis of total
area of construction) is located in coastal counties with a high concentration in large urban areas
such as the tri‐county (Palm Beach, Broward, and Miami‐Dade) corridor in Southeast Florida,
the west‐central region around Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, and the Jacksonville‐St.
Augustine region.
U.S. Census Bureau projections and other studies estimate that Florida’s population will reach
close to 29 million by 2030, which means an increase of some 10 million people more than the
estimated 2007 state population and seven to eight million more residents in coastal counties. If
these projected trends continue, the concentration of built environment will likely continue to
increase along the same parameters as those currently in place.
Florida is vulnerable to a wide range of natural hazards, including hurricanes, coastal storms,
floods, tornadoes, wildfire, drought, extreme heat, winter storms and freezes, erosion,
sinkholes, and storm surge. The risk of some of these hazards will be exacerbated by climate
change, while the risk of others will be lessened.
Design criteria are part of building codes used to design buildings that are expected to have a
minimum service life of 75–100 years and that can withstand extreme events. The Florida
Building Code became the single‐state building code as of March 1, 2002. The expressed intent
of the Florida Building Code is “…to establish the minimum requirements to safeguard the
public health, safety and general welfare through structural strength, means of egress facilities,
stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, and safety to life and
property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment…”
One of the most important issues with regard to adapting the built environment to climate
change is that buildings and structures are designed on the basis of the minimum requirements
established by the building code, which are primarily based on historical data on forces such as
wind loads and hydrodynamic pressure from storm surge. As the risks from such natural
hazards are exacerbated by climate change, existing buildings and those being designed today
may be subjected to impacts that exceed the designed capabilities. This could lead to
catastrophic damage. Adapting the built environment to the impact of climate change will

F‐25
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
require design criteria and building codes that consider potential future impacts in establishing
minimum design requirements.

Objectives
1. Reduce the potential for damage to the built environment from the impact of natural
hazards, especially from those hazards caused or exacerbated by climate change, make this
a high priority for all levels of government and the private sector in Florida.
2. Make the practice of adapting the built environment to the impact of climate change an
integral component of comprehensive planning, building codes, life‐safety codes,
emergency management, land development and zoning regulations, water management,
flood control, coastal management, and community development.
3. Make the practice of adapting the built environment to the impact of climate change a
preferred objective of building design, siting, and construction research funded by public
monies in Florida.
4. Foster an environment of communicating and sharing knowledge about adaptation to
climate change and the adaptation/protection of the built environment among the scientific
community, lawmakers, various professional sectors (practitioners), and the general public.
5. Promote an environment to connect science with decision making regarding climate change
and the need to adapt the built environment to its impacts.
6. Promote an environment for connecting scientific research with practical applications that
will contribute to the adaptation of the built environment to the impact of climate change.
7. Encourage the search for practical and effective solutions to ensure that existing and future
built environment in Florida will remain habitable, providing viable shelter for the full
range of human activity and ensuring continuity of critical and essential functions in the
aftermath of impact by climate change–exacerbated hazards.
8. Establish educational and professional licensing requirements to ensure that key
professional sectors become practitioners of adaptation in support of planning, building
design, and construction activities.
9. Require the state, county, and municipal governments throughout Florida to develop and
maintain a local climate change adaptation plan, to provide a framework for assessing
vulnerability, identifying risks, defining and quantifying the value of the built environment
that is at risk (see attachment on Quantifying Value at Risk), and identifying and
implementing effective adaptation measures at each jurisdictional level (i.e., state, county,
municipality, and individual facility).

______________________________________________________________________________
Exercise fiscal responsibility in recognizing not only the magnitude of the problem to be
confronted by future generations but also the need to start implementing and paying for
solutions now while also creating reserves to pay for future measures, especially those that may
be community‐wide or regional in scope.
Objectives for beaches in ADP‐3 are relevant to this ADP Policy Option.

Assets at Risk
Climate change will modify or exacerbate most of the factors mentioned above, which were
used to establish design criteria, during the remaining service life of existing buildings and new
buildings just now being built. For example, certain aspects of climate change (specifically,
increased global mean temperature and SLR) have the capacity to amplify hurricane strength
and potential damage. SLR will have a direct impact on storm surge, perhaps the most
destructive characteristic of hurricanes, as they impact the built environment in the coastal
region. There will also likely be higher incidence of extreme rain events.
This means that a building created on the basis of current design criteria and the minimum
requirements of the Florida Building Code may be subjected to higher loads from storm surge,
wave impact, and precipitation during hurricanes than what it was originally designed for
during its remaining service life. It is likely and perhaps highly probable that a building under
such conditions will suffer severe damage and even structural failure. Those buildings
constructed before the Florida Building Code came into effect are at much higher risk of
suffering catastrophic damage under the impact of climate change–exacerbated hazards.

Existing Actions
HB 7135, passed by the 2008 Florida Legislature, provides certain “lead by example”
improvements to local, state, and regional government building and renovation standards,
including the use of specified green building standards and energy‐efficient design. The Bill
also creates the FECC to centralize policy development and program implementation for energy
and climate change and to review and consider recommendations by the Action Team
concerning building standards and adaptation. In addition, the Bill created the FESC as a
“supercenter of excellence” within the SUS to better coordinate energy‐related research that
supports Florida’s policy objectives for energy and climate change.
This ADP Policy Option covers the entire infrastructure and is divided into the following
categories: building codes and regulations, flood protection, beaches as infrastructure, and
transportation. Many of the issues regarding climate change, goals, and strategies can be
applied to other infrastructure, such as communications; electric power production,
transmission, and distribution; education; and government.

______________________________________________________________________________

ADP-5.1 Building Codes and Regulations
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Require that the Florida Building Code incorporate design criteria for buildings to resist
future loads that may result from the impact of climate change–exacerbated hazards during a
minimum service life of 50 years.
Strategy A: Strengthen Florida Building Code requirements for new structures and
appropriate renovations to encourage resistance to the impacts of climate change.
Strategy B: Conduct research on how building codes can be routinely updated to account
for changes in climate and to develop options on how such codes could account for
potential future changes in risks from climate change.
Strategy C: Determine whether existing construction siting and design requirements under
the Coastal Construction Control Line (CCCL) Program intended to ensure avoidance of
“significant adverse impacts” to the coastal system are adequate under a range of SLR
scenarios.
Goal 2: Require the Florida Building Commission (FBC) to establish a technical committee that
focuses on vulnerability to climate change and that will recommend updates to the building
code as evidence of new trends of risk factors from climate change arise.
Goal 3: Encourage builders to construct new buildings that meet Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design™ (LEED) standards. Reducing energy demand is also an adaptation
strategy, because less energy will be demanded during heat waves and the need for water to
support energy production will be reduced.
Goal 4: Develop a required training program to educate professionals in relevant fields (e.g.,
architecture, engineering, and construction management) on the need to incorporate adaptation
to climate change as a basis for establishing design criteria for new infrastructure. Completion
of such required training should be a condition for relicensing.
Strategy A: Examine licensing and recertification requirements for building professionals
and revise them to include design criteria that account for the impacts of climate change.
Strategy B: Add adaptation criteria to professional education curricula at state universities
and trade schools for building and design degrees.
Goal 5: Empower the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR) and the
various professional licensing boards to incorporate sections on climate change vulnerability
and built environment adaptation methodologies in all licensing examinations.

F‐28

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 6: Create and fund a built environment Climate Change Adaptation Program as a state
research initiative. The program would be charged with engaging the scientific and research
community, by way of competitive research projects and annual announcements of funds
availability, in the assessment of vulnerability and risk of the built environment to the impact of
climate change. It should focus on the development of adaptation methodologies based on new
design criteria, methods and materials of construction, and similar initiatives.
Goal 7: Encourage public universities in Florida to develop educational programs for building
design and construction professionals, planners, and those in other pertinent fields, focusing on
vulnerability to climate change and adaptation methodologies.

ADP-5.2 Flood Protection
Goal 1: Reduce or eliminate the potential for damage from flooding by requiring all new or
substantially renovated buildings to be elevated above potential threshold flood depth
(considering climate change), which is to be determined on a site‐specific basis for the projected
service life of the building.
Strategy: Implement zoning criteria and/or building code design criteria that will require all
new buildings or buildings that are substantially renovated to have a zero‐flood‐depth
elevation that is a minimum of one foot above a projected site‐specific flood depth with an
annual probability of flooding of 0.5 percent during the remaining service life of the
building. For purposes of these requirements, a substantially renovated building is one
where work to be done is equal to or above 25 percent of the current replacement value of
the structure.
Goal 2: Substantially reduce or eliminate storm water runoff as a contributor to flooding.
Strategy: Implement land use and zoning regulations and/or building code design criteria
requiring all new or substantially renovated buildings to incorporate porous materials and
other low‐impact development techniques for site work, sidewalks, curbs, driveways, and
other locations in order to promote water percolation into the ground to reduce runoff
volume during rain events.
Goal 3: Set new parameters for water management with the objective of reducing the potential
for flooding from extreme rain events.
Strategy: Encourage the five water management districts in Florida to work with pertinent
federal and state agencies and the research community to develop extreme‐precipitation
threshold models, which will be used to activate water management actions to reduce the
potential for flash floods. These models and related water management actions are to be
linked to monitoring systems using virtual rain gauges, satellite observations, and other

F‐29

______________________________________________________________________________
technology to forecast the risk of a given amount of precipitation occurring within a given
time frame.
Goal 4: Substantially reduce or eliminate currently developed building sites subject to repetitive
flood loss events.
Strategy: Charge counties and municipalities with cataloging currently developed building
sites that have been flooded three or more times within the last 10 years. Target those sites
for future use conversion to reduce the human risk or the potential for property damage.
Goal 5: Incorporate regional or community‐wide flood protection, on the basis of projected SLR
and other flood threats, into regional and/or comprehensive plans that focus on development
and redevelopment over the next 50 to 100 years.
Strategy: Fund studies to identify community‐wide or region‐wide adaptation alternatives
to reduce the potential for damage from coastal flooding exacerbated by projected SLR.
Such studies will incorporate a comparative analysis, estimated costs, timelines, and
associated economic, social, and environmental impacts of a range of adaptation measures,
including engineering and structural works as well as land‐use and zoning measures.
Goal 6: Develop scenarios for land‐use conversion that accommodate future population growth
and development and that incorporate flood prevention criteria on the basis of projected flood
threats 50 to 100 years from now.

ADP-5.3 Beaches as Infrastructure
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Examine where, how, and to what extent coastal ecosystems confer protection to
vulnerable human communities. Set priorities for protection and for the appropriate
management of these systems.
Strategy A: Undertake comprehensive research and analysis to determine alternative
solutions and establish the engineering and economic feasibility of whether or not selected
sections of the coasts can or should be protected.

•

Determine the engineering feasibility of protecting selected coastal areas, taking into
consideration the porous nature of much of Florida’s coastal geology.

•

Compare the economic cost of armoring and other protection alternatives versus the cost
of abandoning major coastal urbanized areas.

•

Assess economic, political, social, and environmental impacts of alternative solutions or
no action on Florida’s beaches, coastal wetlands, other ecologically important areas, and
near‐shore coastal marine habitats.

Begin the evaluation in the relatively near future since public works projects of this
magnitude take many decades from concept to completion.

ADP-5.4. Transportation and Other Infrastructure
There are 121,525 miles public roads in the state: 12,062 on the state highway system (owned by
FDOT), 107,421 city and county roads, and 2,042 owned by other federal entities.3 There are 19
commercial airports, 14 of which are international. In addition, the state has 14 deepwater
ports.4
Roads, airports, rail, pipelines, ports, beaches, and other infrastructure along and close to
Florida’s coastline are potentially vulnerable to climate change impacts. Unfortunately, a
comprehensive listing of transportation infrastructure at risk in the United States has not been
prepared. Improved information about projected climate change impacts and timing of such
events will be needed to identify specific transportation and other infrastructure at risk.
In Florida, potential impacts of climate change include rising temperatures, increases in the
intensity of heavy rainfalls and hurricanes, and rising sea levels. Because of this, transportation
and other infrastructure along the coast and in low‐lying areas are susceptible to damage from
SLR, storm surge, erosion, flooding, and higher temperatures. However, adaptation,
particularly related to transportation, has not yet received as much attention or research as
climate change mitigation.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Inventory the critical transportation infrastructure at risk; determine whether, when,
and where projected impacts from climate change might be significant; and evaluate the costs
and benefits of alternatives.
Goal 2: Ensure the coordination of adaptation efforts on transportation across jurisdictional
boundaries and the exchange of information, resources, and best practices among government,
the private sector, and other stakeholders.
Goal 3: Ensure that the long‐range planning process on transportation addresses adaptation
and the protection of critical infrastructure.
The following strategies support all three goals:

Strategy A: The FDOT should update the Florida Transportation Plan in cooperation with
federal, state, regional and local governments and modal partners to develop long range
goals, objectives, and strategies for addressing climate change and adapting to potential
impacts from climate change.
Strategy B: State, regional, and local governments and modal partners in Florida should
work cooperatively to identify and evaluate transportation infrastructure at risk and to
coordinate adaptation efforts for infrastructure immediately landward of coastal high
hazard areas or to provide emergency evacuation routes for coastal populations.
Strategy C: FDOT should continue its analysis of rainfall statistics and hurricane surge
(including updating such statistics and analyzing the accompanying affects of wave forces
and erosion on highways and bridges) and in other areas to identify infrastructure at risk.

ADP-7. Economic Development

Description of Issues
Florida’s gross state product in 2007 was more than $734 billion. Of that, agriculture was $7
billion, mining was $1 billion, and construction was $45 billion. In 2007, Florida had more than
85 million visitors, generating more than $65 billion in revenues.

Objectives
•

To adapt Florida to new economic trends and realities brought on by the powerful drivers
of energy and climate change;

•

To generate useful economic trend analysis and data to guide economic development
decision making; and

•

To create policies, programs, and implementation mechanisms that support the ability of
Florida’s economy to adapt to climate change.

Assets at Risk
Climate change is likely to have a significant effect on all sectors of Florida’s economy. Some
sectors will likely face acute challenges, while others will likely enjoy growth opportunities.
There could be significant damage to some economic sectors, such as real estate, tourism,
agriculture (e.g., productivity and export markets), and other resource‐based industries.
The state would benefit by early identification of business opportunities (and risks) associated
with climate change to increase its global competitive advantage and to increase the creation of
new jobs within the state. An impact assessment is needed to forecast potential disruption to
Florida’s major economic sectors due to climate change impacts, such as more frequent tropical
storms, SLR, drought, acute flooding events, saltwater intrusion, and possible habitat and
species disruption.
Successful economic adaptation will require anticipating and responding to the challenges and
opportunities, given such economic trends.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: The Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic Development (OTTED) and Enterprise
Florida—in conjunction with the FECC—should undertake an analysis to look at new
opportunities and at economic sectors that may be negatively impacted.
Goal 2: Establish the economic value and importance of natural resources to the state economy
overall and to tourism and other resource‐based sectors.

F‐34
Appendix F

www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 3: Identify policy issues related to habitat and species management, human needs,
hunting, fishing, boating, and outdoor recreation.

ADP-7.1 Tourism
Tourism in Florida constitutes more than 10 percent of the state’s economy. The state’s thriving
tourism sector depends on the richness and diversity of Florida’s natural resources. Its climate,
forests, parks, waterways, beaches, marine systems, habitat, species, flora and fauna, and other
attractions bring more than 70 million tourists to the state each year.
SLR, increased hurricane intensity, increased storm intensity, drought, wildfires, human health
risks, and other outcomes of climate change could be threats to Florida’s tourism industry. In
addition, rising temperatures could make locations further north relatively more attractive to
tourists.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Assess the economic impact of climate change on the tourism sector.
Goal 2: Given the state’s interest in ensuring a healthy tourism sector, assess the level of
appropriate investment in the state’s natural resources.

ADP-7.2 Other Resource-Based Industries
Other resource‐based industries, besides tourism, include agriculture, forestry, marine
resources (e.g., commercial fishing), aquaculture, and mining. While these constitute only about
one percent of the state’s economy, such industries are important to Florida’s way of life and
character. The state should contemplate its interest and role in mitigating the impact of a
changing climate on these sectors.

ADP-7.2.1 Agriculture
The productivity of many crops may be impacted by warmer temperatures, altered
precipitation patterns, more intense storms, changes in runoff patterns, invasive species, and
new pests. Biofuels may present new growth opportunities; however, adequate care should be
taken not to displace food crops. Planning for adequate water supplies may be important to
sustaining this sector.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Assess potential changes in the geographic range, climate tolerances, and economic
viability of current and potential new annual and perennial crops and livestock.

F‐35
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
Goal 2: Review land‐use, tax, and subsidy policies to encourage appropriate adaptation in the
agriculture sector.
Goal 3: Assess potential changes in the extent and distribution of irrigation demand and supply
for agriculture that are due to climate change and incorporate long‐term planning for
agriculture.

ADP-7.2.2 Forests
Aside from the inherent value of Florida’s forests as habitat for many native species, they have
economic value as recreational areas for ecotourism activities and in traditional commercial
applications as a resource for building products. In addition, Florida’s many acres of longleaf
pines and bottom hardwoods on public and private lands are excellent carbon sinks and could
be a source of revenue for public and private landowners through a carbon‐credit trading
system.
Forest resources must be conserved and expanded. Work needs to be done to determine the
level and areas of risk from climate change impacts (e.g., drought, pests, storms, saltwater
intrusion, and invasive species) for this valuable resource.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Continue existing land acquisition/management programs for forested lands.
Goal 2: Adopt land acquisition/management programs with a climate change component.
Goal 3: Explore adaptation of forest stocks through genetics to strengthen stocks against risks
associated with climate change.

ADP-7.2.3 Marine
Florida’s industries based on living marine resources include commercial and recreational
fishing, marine ecotourism (including coastal parks and conservation areas), marine
pharmaceuticals, and marine research and education. The direct 2006–2007 value of these
industries to Florida’s economy was $4.4 billion (National Ocean Economics Program [NOEP],
2008), and the indirect value of related infrastructure and support was many times larger.
Adaptive responses to protect the core living resources these industries rely on are addressed in
ADP‐3, Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity. This section addresses threats to the
availability and human uses of the resources, beyond considerations made in other adaptation
response actions.
The adaptive management of Florida’s marine resources and their sustainable use in a changing
climate will be designed to protect the living resources and the social, economic, and cultural
systems that form Florida’s industries.

F‐36
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
The geographic ranges and abundances of living marine resources are likely to change as
climate, ocean temperatures and currents, water quality, and related controlling factors change.
Likewise, the ranges, abundances, and impacts of marine diseases, invasive species, parasites,
and harmful algal blooms could change.
Fisheries, principal fishing grounds, ecotourism destinations, and the land‐based operations
and facilities that support these industries may migrate to different areas in the state as a
consequence of these changes. Such changes have the potential to impact the economic viability
of industries dependent on living marine resources. The same changes can also have negative
effects on the health and safety of industry workers and consumers of industry products and
services. Public and private investments in land acquisition for future parks and conservation
areas, future working waterfronts for fishing and ecotourism, and future marine research and
education facilities will be influenced by climate change, and the effects could be significant.
The same processes that may diminish Florida’s existing marine industries may lead to new
opportunities for fisheries, ecotourism, and allied economies. Adaptive management will
require an ability to detect and exploit such possibilities.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Provide an integrated tracking and reporting system for the ranges, abundances, and
condition of species valued for their roles in fisheries, ecotourism, aquaculture,
pharmaceuticals, and research.
Goal 2: Develop and implement an integrated screening and tracking program for species die‐
offs, marine diseases, invasive species, and parasites that is modeled after programs that
monitor the state’s harmful algal blooms.
Strategy: Goals 1 and 2 will be met through the use and expansion of existing state and
federal programs and platforms for monitoring, event responses, data management, and
public reporting.
Goal 3: Implement educational programs to reduce vessel‐based conveyances of unwanted
species into Florida waters and to protect industry workers and consumers from novel health
and safety challenges.
Strategy: Collaborate with the Florida Sea Grant College Program (FSG) to implement the
programs.
Goal 4: Develop conceptual plans for the co‐location of new working waterfronts for activities
such as fishing, ecotourism, and marine research that employ green infrastructure adapted to
emerging challenges of climate change.
Strategy: Engage university planning, engineering, and architectural schools in developing
the conceptual plans.

______________________________________________________________________________

ADP-7.2.4 Aquaculture
Aquaculture is a rapidly developing industry in Florida. As the state’s fisheries become
depleted, either through over‐harvest or climate change impacts, cultured seafood products will
increase in importance. Florida producers sold $74.9 million of aquaculture products in 2005,
ranking Florida seventh in the nation in terms of aquaculture sales. More than 900 Florida
aquaculturists produce the largest variety of aquatic species of any state in the nation. Tropical
fish dominate the Florida aquaculture industry as the number one commodity with $33million
in sales in 2005, also making the state the number one producer nationwide. The state is also a
leading U.S. producer of farm‐raised aquatic plants and an important producer of hard clams.
The industry could be threatened by warmer water temperatures, which may make current
breeding grounds unsuitable in the future by exceeding thermal tolerances of the species in
question, reducing dissolved oxygen levels, and allowing for the introduction of pests and
disease. SLR can threaten facilities with inundation, turn freshwaters brackish, and inundate
coastal wetlands. Increased intensity of hurricanes and other storms can damage or destroy
fisheries and facilities. Drought can reduce freshwater flows and degrade water quality.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Develop plans for increasing seafood product aquaculture to supplement declining
ocean stocks.
Goal 2: Encourage expanded and increased leases for aquaculture on submerged state lands.
Goal 3: Review existing out‐of‐state marketing programs with an eye to increasing those sales
of Florida aquaculture products.
Goal 4: Identify and institute management practices to ensure healthy growth of this industry.
Goal 5: Identify innovative and federal funding sources for mitigation and adaptive strategies.

ADP-7.2.5 Mining
Nationally, Florida ranks fifth in the production of limestone, sand and gravel, clay, peat, heavy
minerals, and phosphate. The state’s mines supply one‐quarter of the world’s and three‐
quarters of the U.S. domestic needs. Nearly all of the phosphate mined is used for the national
and international production of agricultural fertilizer. In 2000, approximately $1.13 billion
worth of fertilizer was exported. Phosphate mines in northern and central Florida have been a
valuable resource for the national and international production of agricultural fertilizers,
although many of these lands are now considered degraded and disturbed.
After mining operations have ceased, these lands could be used for rotation bioenergy crops, as
well as for carbon sequestration. Mining also has implications for aquifers and water supplies
and storage that should be noted here.
F‐38
Appendix F

______________________________________________________________________________

Goals and Strategies
•

Study soil carbon dynamics to estimate the long‐term potential for carbon sequestration in
new growth forest and through underground sequestration.

•

Determine environmental and cost benefits of developing short‐rotation woody crops on
formerly mined lands.

•

Review and select tree species appropriate for such sites.

•

Identify management practices to ensure plant survival and maximize growth.

ADP-7.3 Construction
Construction is more than 6.0 percent of Florida’s economic output. Construction employment
represented approximately 8.5 percent of total non‐agricultural jobs, and more than 210,000
annual building permits were issued as recently as the end of 2006. The industry has been
affected by a change in supply and demand for key building materials (e.g., lumber, cement,
reinforcing steel, and plywood), resulting in huge increases in prices that in some cases reached
200 percent, 300 percent, or higher in just one year. Climate change has the potential for exerting
significant impact on the construction sector through such changes as extreme precipitation,
drought, SLR, or the exacerbation of natural hazards such as storm surge and flooding.
Climate change–driven modifications in the construction industry have the potential to
significantly impact the economy of the communities and regions affected. The consequences of
climate change may include the following, all of which would likely result in increased costs:

•

The need to adapt existing and future buildings so that they can withstand the impacts of
climate change will require that design professionals carry out additional studies and
calculations or engage other experts as consultants.

•

Buildings may need to have deeper and stronger foundations, be elevated above a higher
“zero flood elevation,” have much higher insulation values than currently required, have
much higher roof drainage capacity, or incorporate green building features.

•

Higher temperatures during the work day or higher and more frequent extreme
precipitation events have the potential for affecting working conditions, which will increase
not only the cost of construction but also the income of construction workers.

•

Should the need for adaptation become a requirement for new construction, the demand for
adaptation‐related practices would increase.

•

Retrofitting, demolition, or conversion projects of existing buildings may be needed to adapt
them to climate change, or to retreat from hazardous zones.

Retreat may have an adverse effect on the volume of construction in relatively vulnerable areas,
leading to economic losses and labor reductions in the construction industry.

______________________________________________________________________________

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Identify the sensitivity of the construction industry in Florida to a range of external,
non‐climate change–driven factors that have the potential for affecting the economic aspects of
the construction industry.
Goal 2: Measure the economic impact resulting from climate change–driven consequences on
the construction industry and related sectors and from non‐climate change factors, with
projected scenarios at five‐year intervals.
Goal 3: Identify those communities, regions, or sectors along with related or interlinked sectors
that may suffer adverse economic consequences as a result of the impact of climate change on
the construction industry, and commission a study to identify effective measures to reduce the
potential for such adverse consequences.
Goal 4: Measure how adaptation procedures applied through construction methods, materials,
or design criteria may reduce the risk of damage to the built environment and link such risk‐
reduction to a reduction in insurance premiums.

ADP-8. Insurance (Property and Casualty)

Description of Issues
With more than 1,350 miles of coastline, Florida is physically and financially vulnerable to the
effects of climate change. Ninety percent of Floridians live within 50 miles of the coast, and the
value of property in this area is approaching $2.0 trillion. Additionally, the state’s largest
insurance company—Citizens Property Insurance Corporation—has 1.3 million policyholders
and is financially supported by Florida’s insurance consumers.
Insurance from flooding falls under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is
administered by the federal government, and Floridians account for 40 percent of NFIP’s
policyholders. Insurance for wind damage is typically covered by private insurance policies,
which are regulated by state governments. The Citizens Insurance Company is the insuring
entity of last resort for hurricane wind coverage.

Assets at Risk
Insurance companies in Florida insure assets worth billions of dollars—homes, businesses,
agriculture, infrastructure, parks, and beaches. All of these assets and more are at risk to the
myriad effects of climate change. Florida’s current pricing structure does not truly reflect the
risk of loss, particularly for Florida’s coastal regions.
Scientific studies have established that climate change increases the intensity of hurricanes. In
addition, SLR will erode shorelines, threatening many properties, and will result in higher
storm surge from hurricanes. Other climate outcomes, such as wildfire, intense rain events, and
drought can also pose risks to lives and property. Given Florida’s geography, coastal density,
and a $65.0 billion dollar tourism economy, plus eight major storms in 2004 and 2005, property
insurance and affordability issues are one of Florida’s greatest challenges.

Existing Actions
In 2005, the Florida Legislature passed a law requiring all residential property insurance
companies to file with the Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) a range of premium discounts
offered to customers who live in homes of certain construction types or who apply loss
mitigation devices (like shutters) to their homes. Beginning on September 5, 2007, all property
insurers were required to offer higher discounts in their insurance rates for policyholders who
had recognized loss mitigation devices on their homes. Insurers are required to send a list of
those discounts with exact dollar savings to all new and renewed policyholders.
The NFIP, managed by the federal government, provides insurance for damage from flooding
(e.g., storm surge). Damage from wind and other causes is typically covered by private
insurance. In 2007, Florida created the Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (CPIC)

F‐41

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
to provide multi‐cause and wind‐only insurance coverage to homeowners and businesses in
Florida.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Encourage insurance companies to provide policyholders with greater disclosure about
climate risk. Insurance companies need to adequately inform their customers and shareholders
about the risks climate change poses to the insurance business and the ability of the industry to
pay policyholders’ claims. Insurance companies also need to take necessary steps to mitigate
against these risks.
Goal 2: Understand the relationship between the threats of climate change, SLR, and providing
affordable insurance premiums to Florida home and business owners. Address equitable and
fair differences in insurance for coastal and inland properties.
Goal 3: Florida should develop policies that make coastal communities and infrastructure more
resilient to natural disasters through programs such as the My Safe Florida Home program.
Goal 4: Fully define the issues surrounding risk‐based pricing in the property and casualty
insurance industry for Florida.
Goal 5: Insurance pricing and availability can encourage or discourage particular forms of
coastal development. Subsidized coastal insurance polices such as the Florida CPIC, should be
consistent with federal and state programs designed to reduce high‐risk shoreline development,
increase coastal system resiliency, and protect important coastal resources vulnerable to risks
associated with climate change.

ADP-9. Emergency Preparedness and Response (Extreme Events)

Definition of Issues
Throughout the history of settlement in Florida, extreme weather events—particularly in the
form of hurricanes—have played a major role in shaping culture, commerce, and community
development. As a result, Florida’s state government has developed one of the more robust
emergency preparedness and response infrastructures in the nation. This was particularly
evident in the depth of aid provided by Florida to Mississippi during the 2006 hurricane season
in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
Global climate change is likely to increase Florida’s risk of extreme weather events. Whether
hurricane frequency will increase, given rising sea‐surface temperatures, is uncertain at present.
Current science supports increased intensity and duration for storms that form in the Atlantic
and the Gulf of Mexico. When coupled with rising sea levels, future hurricane events may yield
greater storm surge effects to put coastal communities at greater risk for damage than is the case
today. In addition, there could be more intense rain events, droughts, wildfires, and heat
emergencies.
Extreme weather across the state can:

•

Overtax the emergency response systems and funding for flood response,

•

Result in major storms and power outages,

•

Affect buildings or transportation routes, and

•

Cause drought‐related fires.

Hurricanes, as Florida’s typical extreme weather event, may no longer be the only major threat
to Floridians. An analysis of predictable climate change impacts would include projections for
other intense rain events, not to mention increased droughts, wildfires, heat, and public health
emergencies.
Additionally, given the many fronts that climate change is expected to present to Florida’s
emergency infrastructure, there is the possibility that several of these impacts might occur
simultaneously.
Delayed emergency response could become more common.

Objectives
Florida’s current emergency preparedness and response functions are a coordinated effort
between federal, state, and local governmental agencies, as well as nongovernmental

F‐43
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

______________________________________________________________________________
organizations (NGOs). The objective of Florida’s future emergency preparedness and response
functions must be to build on the excellence gained through past experience to ensure sufficient
capacity and efficacy in protecting public heath and welfare in more severe storm events with
increased incidence of storm surge and the associated coastal damage. As the impact of SLR and
higher storm surges becomes more evident, development patterns must be constrained to
increase the resiliency of coastal communities and to protect those communities.
Floridians must be prepared for an increased incidence of heat‐related illness in large sectors of
the public, particularly given Florida’s large population of senior citizens. As temperatures rise
and the climate becomes more tropical, water‐ and vector‐borne diseases now associated with
more equatorial climes might become commonplace in Florida. This situation will be
aggravated by increased flooding events and their associated impacts on certain portions of the
public infrastructure such as sewage systems, hospitals, and nursing homes.
Moreover, Florida must be prepared to address the synergistic effects of multiple climate
stressors on its emergency response infrastructure and, prior to such occurrences, must devise
an approach to deal with this by building on our existing skills in emergency preparedness and
environmental response. Policy makers in particular need information and data on changes in
risks from climate change and need to know where to get such information.

Assets at Risk
While all of Florida’s counties are subject to extreme weather events, coastal communities and
ecosystems are at particular risk from increased storm surge and increased hurricane intensity.
The vast majority (70 percent) of Florida’s population lives in the coastal zone. Likewise, the
vast majority of the state’s existing building stock is situated near the coast. While many coastal
ecosystems have adapted to periodic extreme weather, system resiliency in some cases may be
undermined because of the loss of habitat, pressures from invasive exotic species, or other
incidences that prevent post‐hurricane recovery.
Aside from risk to the human population from hurricane events, increases in temperatures may
cause certain water‐ and vector‐borne diseases normally associated with more southern
climates to migrate to Florida. Increased flooding and infrastructure damages resulting from
increased heat and flooding could aggravate these risks.

Existing Actions
Many of the impacts that climate change is projected to bring are already familiar to Floridians.
Consequently, programs to address impacts such as increased intensity of hurricanes and major
storm events, storm surge and erosion, saltwater intrusion, and the availability of potable
drinking water supplies have been implemented. Additionally, Florida’s excellent emergency
response infrastructure has proven itself under many scenarios, and the planning mechanisms
that are part of that infrastructure are in place to deal with a large variety of catastrophic events.
However, it is uncertain to what extent these programs and infrastructure will be affected by

F‐44

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
future impacts associate with climate change, or to what extent additional financial resources
will be needed to meet these future conditions.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Ensure sufficient response capability among regional, state, and local first responders to
potential increases in extreme weather events.
Goal 2: Increase the resiliency of coastal communities to storm surge.
Strategy: See ADP 2.1, Goal 4, Strategy D
Goal 3: Assess the role of ecosystems such as coastal wetlands and beaches and dunes in
reducing risks from extreme events.
Goal 4: Plan for other extreme events (e.g., flooding, wildfire, and heat waves).
Goal 5: Develop a process for early detection, evaluation, and handling of extreme events
resulting from climate change. Effectively distribute such information to key emergency
preparedness and response personnel.
Goal 6: Invest in emergency response and mitigation strategies for extreme environmental
events likely to be exacerbated by climate change.

ADP-10. Human Health Concerns

Description of Issues
Florida’s current population is over 18 million, and 17 percent are over 65 years of age (higher
than the national average of 12 percent). By 2030, Florida is projected to be the nation’s third
most populous state with almost 29 million residents, with 27 percent of the population
projected to be over age 65. That keeps Florida as the state with the highest population of senior
citizens as a percentage of total population. Senior citizens have greater vulnerability to impacts
of climate change than the population at large, although children under five, those living in
poverty, and those living in coastal areas can also be vulnerable.

Objectives
The health and wellbeing of the citizens is of prime importance to the State of Florida.
Incorporating considerations of climate change into the state’s health plan to protect the citizens
is as important as designing water treatment infrastructure to reduce harm to human health.
Successful research in this area would identify the increasing risks to human health, which
segments of the population are most vulnerable, and how risks to their health can be reduced.

Assets at Risk
Climate change is expected to have a wide range of impacts on Florida’s health systems. The
historical range of mosquito‐ and vector‐borne diseases may shift with a changing climate.
More intense extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heat waves, flooding, and wildfires,
will directly impact human health in Florida. Equally important are alterations in the moisture
content of the atmosphere and wind patterns that will likely affect the concentration of air
pollution in a given location.
Climate change may increase the risk of some infectious diseases; particularly those diseases
that appear in warm areas and are spread by mosquitoes and other insects. These vector‐borne
diseases include malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis. Also, algal blooms could
occur more frequently as temperatures warm—particularly in areas with polluted waters—in
which case diseases (such as cholera) that tend to accompany algal blooms could become more
frequent. These diseases can be transmitted to people and can also affect livestock and wildlife,
which can indirectly affect people.

low‐income and underserved populations and other vulnerable groups.
Goal 3: Provide adequate training for first responder and emergency responder personnel.
Goal 4: Limit growth in areas whose evacuation will be challenged by SLR and increased storm
frequency or severity.

ADP-10.5 Medical Treatment and Biomedicine Development
Goal 1: Increase the focus of medical schools at state universities to include diseases that can be
attributed to climate change.
Goal 2: Promote the research and development (R&D) of biopharmaceuticals for treating
diseases that can be attributed to climate change.

ADP-11. Social Effects

Description of Issues
Currently Florida’s population is over 18 million, and its projected growth is to 29 million by
2030. Additionally, Florida’s coasts are home to at least 70 percent of the population. The coastal
environment provides diverse habitats for countless marine and terrestrial species. For
centuries, humans have lived, worked, and played along the coasts, and the ocean has long
been an important component of the economy, from fishing to tourism.
Sea levels are expected to rise in the foreseeable future at an accelerated rate as the earth’s
climate warms, which makes Florida’s coastlines particularly vulnerable. Climate change will
likely affect not only the physical coastline, but also the millions of people who live and work in
Florida. Understanding the impacts of climate change on Florida’s coasts and inland areas
therefore requires the perspectives of sociologists, economists, and scientists alike.
Society can deal with slow trends in climate, occurring over the many thousands of years that
are characteristic of ice age cycles, but decade‐to‐century changes (i.e., those that occur on the
timescale of a human lifetime) and the ability of societies to evolve quickly enough are
potentially catastrophic.

Objectives
Climate change has the potential to play a critical role on human behavior over the next
century. Even if all human activities that contribute to global change were stopped today,
change would continue, as the present surplus of GHG in the atmosphere will remain for
centuries. Therefore, Floridians need to decide today what changes they must make in their
present behaviors in order to live in the changing climate.
Disaster management can provide some valuable lessons on encouraging changes in behavior.
With Florida’s experience in preparing for and responding to hurricanes, the tactics and
strategies that people have learned to use to mitigate the effects of climate variability are now
very basic. People will make decisions based on what they know and how they have operated
in the past. It will be more difficult to adapt to climate change if it is dramatic and sudden and
causes large disturbances. Thus, education and outreach (see ADP‐15) will be an important
component of adaptation, as will understanding how people respond to changes in risks and
information on changes in risks.

Assets at Risk
Increased development to accommodate Florida’s projected population growth will most likely
increase climate exposure and risks to Florida’s citizens and their current way of life. Florida
must recognize that all regions of the state will encounter socioeconomic changes, including

F‐49
Appendix F

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

•

Increased housing and insurance costs, especially those related to storm events and SLR;

•

Increased charges for energy consumption and transportation changes; and

•

Increased cost of infrastructure improvements, including roads, sewer systems, wastewater
treatment facilities, water control structures, and property protection.

An additional concern is the migration of people. Florida could attract people migrating from
the Caribbean and elsewhere as a result of climate change impacts. In addition, it is possible
that some Floridians will migrate inland from the coast.

ADP-11.1 Social Justice Issues
Goal 1: Promote social and economic equity, improve environmental management, reduce
poverty, decrease the discharges of wastes, increase consumption efficiencies, and increase the
quality of life for the vulnerable.
Goal 2: Assess potential social impacts of climate change on incomes, and other measures of
well‐being in vulnerable communities.

ADP-11.2 Food and Water Security
Goal 1: Ensure that access to safe food supply and water considers variations in risks from
climate change such as SLR, increased hurricane intensity, inland flooding, wildfire, drought,
changes in water quality, and other potential impacts

ADP-11.3 Housing Security
Goal 1: Consider potential impacts of climate change on housing. In particular, plan for SLR to
threaten homes and apartment buildings located on the coast. Also consider other impacts of
climate change and their risks to housing, such as more severe hurricanes, flooding, and
wildfire.

ADP-11.4 Intersection of Climate Change and Human Behavior
Goal 1: Create incentives for the general public and businesses to use the latest technologies to
adapt to climate change
Goal 2: Improve tracking of national and global trends on modifying human behavior and
adopt the best management practices applicable to the State of Florida.

ADP-12. Organizing State Government for the Long Haul

Description of Issues
The range of adaptation planning issues outlined in this document is a testament to the number
of issue areas and concerns that need to be adequately addressed to ensure that Florida
successfully adapts to impacts caused by global climate change over the next century. In
developing and implementing such a wide‐ranging adaptation plan for the state, Florida will
require a single point of focus within state government.
During the 2008 regular session of the Florida Legislature, HB 7135 (Ch. 2008‐227, Laws of
Florida) created the FECC and imbued the commission with a broad range of duties and
powers, including responsibility for coordinating adaptation planning development and
implementation within state government. The FECC is appropriately housed within the
Executive Office of the Governor, thus elevating the climate change issue and enabling cross‐
agency coordination of efforts.

Objectives
The principal objective is to ensure the creation of a single point of focus within state
government that can continue assessing the risks posed to Florida by global climate change,
develop increasingly informed adaptation planning over many decades, and learn from prior
implementation to adjust adaptation planning in Florida as events on the ground change.

Assets at Risk
Florida is a state with more than 1,350 miles of coastline and mostly low elevations. It is within
the historic pathway of destructive weather events and particularly vulnerable to SLR, tidal
surge, saltwater intrusion, and flooding. Coastal infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, and
utilities) and towns and cities are also at risk. Florida has already felt the effects of mass human
migrations for storm events alone. These conditions are expected to worsen in the future and be
less temporary in nature. Freshwater resources are increasingly precious in the state and
already pressured by Florida’s growing population. Climate change poses risks to terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. All of these can add to existing
stresses, such as population growth, land‐use change, and pollution. The state of Florida will be
affected by climate change through impacts on its physical assets, changes in revenues and
expenditures, and changes in the activities it regulates.

Existing Actions
The Legislature created the FECC, which has the sufficient scope, powers, and resources to
accomplish the intent of this element of adaptation planning.

F‐52
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Determine effective planning and implementation mechanisms to integrate land,
transportation, habitat, fish and wildlife protection, and water planning and management at all
levels of government.
Goal 2: The FECC should create a State Climate Change Adaptation Plan Advisory Team to
draft a State Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The plan should include identifying
management, engineering, and technical solutions; developing design concepts for preferred
solutions; and conducting initial feasibility studies relative to the scope, budgets, regulatory
compliance, and timelines for the implementation of specific proposed adaptation solutions on
regional scales.
Goal 3: Determine whether Florida should create a Coastal Commission to provide for more
centralized authority and management of the state’s coastal resources in view of future climate
change impacts. The study should review existing Florida institutions, such as the Florida
Ocean and Coastal Resources Council and similar institutions in other coastal states.

ADP-13. State Funding and Financing

Description of Issues
Adequate adaptation funding for Florida would include funds made available to address the
impacts of climate change. Many programs are already in place and are intended to deal with
some of these impacts. Some of these programs are already funded and may even have
dedicated financing streams, but most existing programs are subject to political and economic
cycles and disruption. Climate change impacts can be expected to intensify in the future and
might also occur simultaneously, on all fronts, as opposed to the isolated incidences that are
customary to Floridians and program resources. If and when this happens, it can be expected to
greatly increase the pressure on funding and financing infrastructure.

Objectives
Florida should be prepared to fund the protection of human health and critical infrastructure, as
well as address other impacts of climate change, where feasible, within a framework of
protection, accommodation and, in some cases, retreat.

Assets at Risk
Florida is a state with more than 1,350 miles of coastline and mostly low elevations. It is within
the historic pathway of destructive weather events and particularly vulnerable to SLR, tidal
surge, saltwater intrusion, and flooding. Coastal infrastructure (e.g., roads, bridges, and
utilities) and towns and cities are also at risk. Florida has already felt the effects of mass human
migrations for storm events alone, and these conditions are expected to worsen in the future
and be less temporary. Freshwater resources are increasingly scarce in the state and already
pressured by Florida’s growing population. Climate change poses risks to terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. All of these stresses can add to existing
stresses, such as population growth, land‐use change, and pollution, further straining any
existing funding and financial resources intended to address these impacts.

Existing Actions
HB 7135, passed by the 2008 Florida Legislature, provided for the FECC, which is already
preparing to explore funding and financing options with regard to adaptation issues in its
deliberations.
Many of the expected impacts that climate change might bring are already familiar to
Floridians. Consequently, programs to address such things as hurricanes and major storm
events, storm surge and erosion, saltwater intrusion, and the availability of potable drinking
water supplies have been implemented. Additionally, Florida’s excellent emergency response
infrastructure has proven itself under many scenarios and the planning mechanisms that are
part of that infrastructure are in place to deal with a large variety of catastrophic events.
F‐54
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
However, it is not known to what extent these programs and infrastructure will be pressured by
future climate change–associated impacts or to what extent the funding will continue to be
adequate under those future conditions.

Goals and Strategies
Many of the goals and strategies in other ADPs will require financial and staff resources.
Florida will need to consider the financial implications of the adaptation goals and strategies.
Goal 1: Examine existing funding and financing infrastructure to determine adequacy for
meeting increased demands of climate change impacts.
Goal 2: Examine alternative financing methods to meet climate change demands and consider
protecting them from short‐term economic or political cycles by dedicating funding.
Goal 3: Consider strategies for emergency funding or financing mechanisms for unforeseen and
unplanned consequences of climate change.
Goal 4: Consider carbon credit revenues as an adaptation financing resource.
Goal 5: Examine opportunities for other sources of funding such as federal funds from
emerging federal climate change legislation. In addition, opportunities to coordinate with
private financing, including foundation resources, should be examined. Support allocation of
cap and trade allocation funds to the states to support climate change adaptation.

ADP-14. Coordinating with Other Regulatory and Standards Entities

Description of Issues
The federal government is participating in a wide range of climate activities nationwide. They
also fund state and regional entities that provide climate services. Activities include data
collection and interpretation and product dissemination. Primary agencies involved include
NOAA, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Natural
Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Several
products developed by federal agencies (e.g., drought severity categories and river flood
forecasts) trigger a variety of Florida emergency and economic relief activities. Additional
federal entities to be considered include the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S.
Department of Energy (US DOE) (including the ENERGY STAR Program), National Science
Foundation (NSF), and others.
In addition, a number of professional societies and other organizations are actively involved in
activities to better understand the potential impacts of climate change on the members they
serve. These societies often represent fundamental public service providers (e.g., water utilities
[American Water Works Association] and coastal states [Coastal States Organization]) or are
organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Pew Center on
Global Climate Change and the Heinz Center that have examined climate change risks and
adaptation. These organizations need early involvement in decision making and will require
sufficient data to make informed decisions regarding risk and reliability, public health and
safety, and financial management. Collectively, they represent a broad base of the population,
possess unmatched knowledge of the industry they represent, and offer tremendous
opportunities for technology transfer, public education, and widespread reach.

Objectives
Develop functional collaborative relationships between the State of Florida and selected federal
government agencies, departments, and entities, as well as other states and, as appropriate,
other countries and key professional societies to collaborate on climate change issues of mutual
interest.

•

Develop a research agenda to address shared interests and priorities.

•

Identify and align with funding sources and allocation decisions essential to Florida’s future
as it relates to climate change.

Assets at Risk
The federal government has the lead and is central to most of the significant climate change and
related programs, research, funding, and information dissemination. Failing to actively engage

F‐56
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
with the various agencies will result in missed opportunities to ensure that Florida’s needs are
expressed, understood, and addressed. Additionally, working in a vacuum will result in waste
and inefficient use of the limited financial, intellectual, and physical resources and will not
properly leverage the vast pool of people who have been working on climate change and
related issues for years. Lastly, Florida must actively engage with the federal process and work
as a cohesive unit (a state with numerous needs, challenges, and sometimes competing
objectives) to ensure that the concerned parties are not competing with each other for limited
dollars and research priorities.
Additionally, adaptation only “buys time.” Rapid and significant GHG mitigation is the only
long‐term solution. Understanding that the two must go hand‐in‐hand is crucial.

Existing Actions
HB 7135, requires DEP and the Florida Department of Education (DOE), in coordination with
the business, environmental, and energy communities, to develop an awards program to
recognize efforts or achievements in conservation, energy and water use reduction, green
cleaning solutions, green pest management, recycling efforts, and curriculum development that
enhance the quality of education while preserving the environment. The Legislature
encouraged the Florida DOE and DEP to form partnerships with the private sector to help fund
the program. The provision would implement an environmental and educational
award/recognition program that encourages district school boards, teachers, classes, and
students to actively participate in strategies leading to environmental preservation.

14.1 Federal Government
Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Develop a clear understanding of the functions and information available (needed) from
key federal agencies.
Goal 2: Identify data gaps and prioritize research needs to establish an agreed‐upon research
agenda representing Florida’s collective needs.
Goal 3: Prioritize funding needs and develop a strategy to secure federal and federal flow‐down
funding to meet strategic needs in Florida.
Goal 4: Request and engage the support of federal agencies, such as NOAA, USGS, Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), that
can provide technological and logistical support and work with RPCs and other state, county,
and local planning bodies to develop regional scenarios of climate change and analyze potential
changes in vulnerability.

ADP-15. Public Education and Outreach

Description of Issues
Public education and outreach about climate change in Florida is needed to support necessary
mitigation and adaptation actions. Florida is “ground zero” for climate change impacts in the
United States with its low lying and densely populated coastal zones, susceptibility to
hurricanes, and vulnerable natural resources. It seems that few people realize Florida’s
vulnerability, but these few are calling for detailed and accurate information and solutions. A
focused and comprehensive stakeholder education and outreach program is a key component
in building support for the mitigation and adaptation policy changes that will become critical
issues in Florida.

Objectives
Florida can become a national and international leader in the distribution of climate change
information in the process of educating a broad diversity of constituents with a cutting‐edge
and successful public education program. The success of any climate change adaptation
demands full participation of the stakeholders (i.e., the citizens of Florida). The objectives of a
successful public education outreach program would be fourfold:
1. To educate all of the stakeholders, including state leadership and state and regional
government officials who implement adaptation actions, citizens of Florida (including
retirees, families, the work force, and K‐16 students), the broader business community,
and faith‐based and community organizations within and outside of Florida who are
important stakeholders in Florida’s adaptation actions. Create incentives to encourage
involvement of the public and key stakeholders. Share not only current knowledge of
the impacts already occurring and expected in Florida, but also short‐ and long‐term
solutions.
2. To design an overarching program that could be quickly and effectively disseminated to
the stakeholders listed above, in clear, concise, and simple terms so all Floridians can
embrace the knowledge. Use media such as the Internet that are widely and easily
accessible.
3. Train, engage, and coordinate practitioners of climate change adaptation and needed
technical support to help Florida plan for climate change. Climate change adaptation
science and related policy improvements are developing fields requiring specific
conceptual and technical skills, which exist independently in the expert community but
require facilitation and training to bring together in a support group of adaptation
experts.

F‐59
Appendix F

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
4. Link outreach programs in public education to the best climate change science so that
issues relating to adaptation and risk management create positive solutions to the
environmental challenges of the future.

Assets at Risk
Principal risks include misunderstood and failed policy actions resulting in political stalemate
and inaction. The best climate change adaptation programs will be at risk if not embraced by
the stakeholders. The best policies might be approved in Tallahassee, but the full understanding
and education of citizens will ensure their timely implementation and endorsement.

Existing Actions
HB 7135 addressed public outreach and education by requiring the DEP and the DOE, in
coordination with the business, environmental, and energy communities, to develop an awards
program to recognize efforts or achievements in conservation, energy and water use reduction,
green cleaning solutions, green pest management, recycling efforts, and curriculum
development that enhances the quality of education while preserving the environment. The
Legislature encouraged DOE and DEP to form partnerships with the private sector to help fund
the program. The provision would implement an environmental and educational
award/recognition program that encourages district school boards, teachers, classes, and
students to actively participate in strategies leading to environmental preservation.

Goals and Strategies
Goal 1: Provide immediate training on climate change adaptation.
Strategy A: Conduct short (2‐day) executive seminars for Chief Executive Officers (CEOs)
and state legislators that have been designed for policy makers and that are conducted by
scientists trained in public education outreach.
Strategy B: Conduct a follow‐up series of comprehensive workshops (4–6 days) that mixes
business and civic leaders from public and private sectors. Local teachers should be
included in all sessions.
Goal 2: Educate the public.
Strategy: Initiate a major public education campaign. Use high profile media and other
appropriate outlets to raise general awareness on climate change in Florida. Make
connections between mitigation and adaptation solutions and policy changes. Educate the
public about the expected costs of inaction and delayed action compared with the costs of
acting proactively. Focal topics could include heat waves and associated health risks, SLR
and associated infrastructure and property risks, wildfire risks, species disturbances and
habitat loss or change and associated ecosystem services losses (impacts to valuable and
highly visible resources such as coral bleaching), and risks to water supplies. Focus groups

F‐60
Appendix F

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
could include the public; policy makers; media; business leaders; developers; and land
owners, buyers, and sellers.
Goal 3: Create adaptation training and collaboration opportunities.
Strategy: Create opportunities for government agencies to work together and with experts
in climate change adaptation to develop needed skills in applying adaptation concepts to
their daily management and planning efforts. Adaptation focus areas would be natural
resources and ecosystem services, infrastructure and development, financial markets, job
markets, and human health and welfare. Technical expert focus groups would include
Florida’s policy makers, research institutions, NGOs, water boards, state agencies, and the
media.
Goal 4: Develop education programs on climate change adaptation for primary and secondary
schools.
Strategy: Revise the state Sunshine Standards for K‐12 education so that vulnerability to
climate change and the practice of adaptation become required subject matter in the
curricula of public schools in Florida. In conjunction with the state standards, a team of
professional educators and scientists should be funded to develop effective units of learning
for all grade levels to ensure that all students are educated about climate change adaptation
and, most importantly, on mechanisms for families to conserve energy and live more
sustainably.
Goal 5: Encourage research and training on adaptation in Florida’s public universities and
research centers. Encourage public universities and research centers in Florida to develop
educational programs in disciplines and professions affected by climate change to focus on
developing adaptation methodologies.

______________________________________________________________________________

Annex 1: Early Action Items Proposed by the ADP TWG
Aside from outlining a structure and plan for moving forward with a comprehensive effort to
address adaptation in Florida, the Technical Work Group (TWG) was asked to identify up to
approximately two dozen strategies or actions that merited early implementation. The TWG
believes that the items listed below represent a selection of appropriate efforts that should be
undertaken promptly. Please note that there are many additional strategies listed in the
accompanying Adaptation TWG Policy Options Document (POD), and it is anticipated that the
successor Florida Energy and Climate Commission will develop additional strategies to address
the goals indicated in the POD in the course of its work.

ADP‐1. Advancing Science Data and Analysis for Climate Change
Goal 2: Foster and support climate science research agenda for Florida with broad priorities.
Institute a new scientific advisory council on climate change to advise state government on this
research agenda. Identify and establish long‐term funding to support research. Funding should
be protected from short‐term economic or political cycles.
a. HB 7135 created the Florida Energy Systems Consortium as a “super center of
excellence” within the State University System. The center should consider, as a priority
order of business, the appointment of a scientific advisory council composed of
members from disciplines relevant to adaptation to climate change and representative of
each participating institution to better coordinate research in support of Florida’s
adaptation and climate change policy objectives.
b. The Florida Energy and Climate Research Trust Fund should be created by the
Legislature, and a dedicated revenue stream should be provided.
Goal 3: Conduct research needed to support incorporation of climate change into the protection
of Florida’s ecosystems and biodiversity.
a. Define the likely new “states” of Florida ecological systems to determine state budget
and policy requirements. Identify species and habitats that will likely be unable to
migrate naturally and craft strategies to assist their relocation or recreate habitat
elsewhere to facilitate this shift.
b. Expand the newly developed Critical Lands & Waters Identification Project (CLIP) v1.0
database to incorporate impacts and adaptation to climate change.
Goal 4: Enhance support for mapping, monitoring, and modeling, all of which will be necessary
to provide information to support policy making. For example, the state is supporting the use of
light detection and ranging (LIDAR) to improve mapping of Florida’s coastlines. Such mapping
should be done for the entire coastline of the state. In addition, effective monitoring programs

F‐62
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
are needed to detect impacts of climate change; modeling is also needed to better project
impacts.
a. Create a new center to coordinate and align data from proxy data sets to build a more
precise picture of climate change in Florida over the last few thousand years and predict
the effects of climate change in the future. This data center could also track associated
responses in vegetation, sea level, and disturbances such as fire.

ADP‐2.1. [Comprehensive Planning] Local Government Level
Goal 2: State and regional agencies should provide financial and technical assistance to local
governments to ensure timely updates of local plans.
a. Update the Florida Department of Community Affairs (DCA) planning tools Web site
section on climate change with adaptation information from the Action Team and other
sources. Tie state and regional agencies into a central state digital database and ensure
that all pertinent state records are digitized. This will provide local government planners
with instant access to the information they need for considering the impacts of updates
to local plans.
Goal 4: Local governments should review their coastal management elements to determine
necessary amendments to make their coastal areas (especially the coastal high‐hazard area)
resilient to the future impacts of climate change, including sea level rise (SLR).
a. Create best practices manual, for local governments, that identifies coastal lands for state
acquisition with new adaptation language incorporated into local, state, and regional
government land acquisition processes.
b. Identify and revise statutory direction for local, state, and regional planning processes to
determine the potential within planning areas for SLR, particularly in coastal areas.
Provide for an assessment of:

•

The potential movement of the coastal construction control line and related changes,

•

The extent and potential for expansion of floodplains, and

•

Potential habitat and wildlife migration.

c. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), DCA, and the state’s
regional planning councils should jointly develop, assess, and recommend for local
governments a suite of planning tools and climate change adaptation strategies to
maximize opportunities to protect the beach/dune system, coastal wetlands, and other
coastal resources in an era of rising seas. The tools should include strategies to
encourage the landward siting and relocation of structures and public facilities in areas

______________________________________________________________________________
adjacent to receding shorelines through acquisition, rolling easements, transfer of
development rights, stronger setbacks, and tax incentives.

ADP‐2.3. [Comprehensive Planning] State Government Level
Goal 3: Balancing Property Rights and Protecting Communities and Natural Resources
Florida statutes, regulations, policies, and the Florida Administrative Code should be reviewed
by the Florida Attorney General to determine potential conflicts between private property
rights and the state and local governments’ responsibility to protect communities.
a. The Florida Attorney General should examine Florida statutes, state policies, and agency
administrative rules to identify, in advance, any potential conflicts between private
property rights and the government’s response to potential climate change impacts.
State or local governments are responsible for protecting their communities, natural
resources, and public usage and access to government‐owned lands. That responsibility
may come into conflict with the individual rights of private landowners who are
affected by SLR, beach erosion, and other impacts of climate change. The Attorney
General should issue a report of his findings that includes recommendations.

ADP‐3.1. [Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity] Uplands, Freshwater and
Marine Systems
Goal 1: Ensure that a representative portfolio of Florida’s terrestrial, freshwater, and marine
natural communities with redundant representation of habitats and species and connecting
corridors (e.g., Florida’s Biodiversity Blueprint) is protected and managed in a manner that
maximizes the health and resilience of these communities when facing climate change impacts.
a. Tie into existing and expanded databases such as the CLIP in order to examine existing
local, state, regional, and federal land holdings and categorize these holdings with
regard to the representative portfolio.
b. Provide an accessible, expanded, and updated database to track changes to the natural
communities and corridors.
c. Evaluate the adequacy of upland, freshwater, and marine systems protection status (for
example through gap analysis) and, where necessary, increase protection area and/or
status in each system to maximize their probability of adapting well to climate change
impacts.

ADP‐3.2. [Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity] Beaches and Beach
Management
Goal 1: Reduce and discourage future reliance on bulkheading/hardening to stabilize estuarine
and beach shorelines. Shoreline hardening should be considered only after a full and
cumulative assessment of short‐ and long‐term impacts to coastal resources and coastal

F‐64
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
ecosystems. Establish policies and regulations that clearly define when, how, where, and under
what circumstances emergency beach stabilization is allowed.
a. Address local, state, and regional permitting programs and planning elements to fully
assess potential impacts and changes to coastal resources and ecosystems from proposed
coastal protection measures in light of potential impacts of climate change.
b. Add an overview element to state and regional planning documents describing
statewide strategies and circumstances for coastal and shoreline retreat and erosion.
c. The state should undertake a comprehensive reevaluation of the Coastal Construction
Control Line Program to ensure that it is accomplishing its intended goal of protecting
the beach and dune system. The reevaluation should consider, among other things, the
adequacy of existing coastal setbacks, building siting and design requirements, and
post‐storm redevelopment policies in light of SLR scenarios.

ADP‐3.3. [Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity] Species Protection
Goal 1: The vulnerability of Florida’s fish and wildlife to climate change impacts is assessed, the
most vulnerable species are identified, and plans are prepared to enhance their chances of
persistence where there is a reasonable likelihood that the species will persist over the next
50 years.
a.

Utilize the CLIP and similar expanded and centralized digital databases to determine
potential species and habitat vulnerability.

b. Incorporate species and habitat vulnerability to climate change into state and regional
planning and zoning, government land acquisition, and determinations for conservation
easements.

ADP‐4. Water Resource Management
Goal 1: Identify and quantify the vulnerabilities and reliability of existing water supplies to
potential effects of differing climate change scenarios with emphasis on source water
availability and quality.
a. Develop inventory of water supply facilities (source, storage, treatment, and
distribution) and conduct a study to develop different climate change scenarios and
potential impacts and adaptation strategies for high‐risk utilities.

ADP‐5.1. [Built Environment, Infrastructure, and Community Protection] Building
Codes and Regulation
Goal 1: Require that the Florida Building Code incorporate building design criteria for resisting
future loads that may result from the impact of climate change–exacerbated hazards during a
minimum service life of 50 years.

______________________________________________________________________________
a. Strengthen Florida Building Code requirements for new structures and appropriate
renovation to encourage climate change impact resistance.
b. Conduct research on how building codes can be routinely updated to account for
changes in climate and develop options on how such codes could account for potential
future changes in risks from climate change.
Goal 4: Develop a required training program to educate professionals in relevant fields (e.g.,
architecture, engineering, and construction management) on the need to incorporate adaptation
to climate change as a basis for establishing design criteria for new infrastructure. Completion
of such required training would be a condition for relicensing.
a. Examine licensing and recertification requirements for building professionals and revise
them to include climate change impact design criteria.
b. Add adaptation criteria to professional education curricula at state universities and
trade schools for building and design degrees.

ADP‐15. Public Education and Outreach
Goal 1: Provide immediate training on climate change adaptation.
a. Conduct short (2‐day) executive seminars for Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and state
legislators that have been designed for policy makers and that are conducted by
scientists trained in public education outreach.
b. Conduct a follow‐up series of comprehensive workshops (4–6 days) that mixes business
and civic leaders from public and private sectors. Local teachers should be included in
all sessions.
Goal 2: Educate the public.
a. Initiate a major public education campaign.
b. Use high‐profile media and other appropriate outlets to raise general awareness on
climate change in Florida. Make connections between mitigation and adaptation
solutions and policy changes. Educate the public about the expected costs of inaction
and delayed action compared with the costs of acting proactively. Focal topics may
include heat waves and associated health risks; SLR and associated infrastructure and
property risks; wildfire risks; species disturbances and habitat loss or change and
associated ecosystem services losses (impacts to valuable and highly visible resources
such as coral bleaching); and risks to water supplies. Focus groups may include the
public; policy makers; media; business leaders; developers; and land owners, buyers,
and sellers.

Annex 2: Priorities for Further Research and Analysis
ADP-1. Advancing Climate Change Science Data and Analysis

Priorities for Further Research and Analysis
Florida needs to emphasize collaborations with international climate scientists, to refine climate
predictions for Florida. The state in partnership with federal agencies, international efforts, and
Florida universities should (1) undertake review of current studies and models and (2) consider
undertaking updating model development to more precisely forecast Florida’s changes in
weather patterns, (3) Undertake specific analysis of uncertainties and contingencies in climate
scenarios for Florida.
Considering that Florida is so vulnerable to potential impacts of sea level rise and hurricane
activity, the state should place a special emphasis on establishing or enhancing existing programs to
follow developments in this field.
In addition to work on sea level rise and hurricane activity the state needs to establish or enhance
existing programs to monitor and determine trends in other climate related impacts that could have
consequences in Florida including: increased drought, wildfires, flooding and storm water
runoff, heat waves, problems with invasive species and insect‐borne disease resulting from
changes in temperature and rainfall regimes, adverse effects on native terrestrial species,
natural communities and marine life, salt water intrusion into aquifers, more frequent and
intense storms, storm surges, tidal regimes, and coastal erosion. Build a decision support
structure to guide and prioritize ongoing Florida‐specific research agenda.
Deploy a “Florida Land and Sea Mesonet” (see e.g., the Oklahoma Mesonet for terrestrial
counterpart) to serve as a world class network of integrated environmental monitoring stations,
drawing from and contributing to existing terrestrial and marine networks, capitalizing and
building upon deployed meteorological stations, ET stations, micro‐meteorology towers , flow
gauges and well/aquifer monitoring, and other critical monitoring networks, to meticulously
track changes in Florida’s climate and hydrology, filling missing gaps in statewide network
coverage. The existing Florida Coastal Ocean Observing System should include climate impacts.
Support scientists working on methods and availability of remote sensing data for continuous
statewide coverage (and associated surrounding oceanographic area of influence), with consistent
spatial grids and measurements, for common inputs for climate and hydrologic models.
Long‐term Climate Proxy data. Create a new Center, or virtual center, to coordinate and align data
from available proxy datasets to build a more precise picture of climate change in Florida over

last few thousand years with associated responses in e.g., vegetation, sea level, changes in fire
regimes, etc. need for more proxy work and gaps in knowledge – spatial and temporal.
Evaluate likely persistence of Florida’s rare species, natural communities, coastal ecosystem and parks
and protected areas under climate change. Suggest during every 10‐year review of state park, forest,
and Wildlife Management Area Management Plans include a thoughtful analysis of
vulnerability to climate change as part of their systematic management planning.
Linking climate scientists with ecologists, economists and social scientists. Issue a RFP from
interdisciplinary teams of social scientists, economists and climate scientists, to build interactive
models, including non‐linearities and feedbacks, to better predict Floridian responses to
anticipated changes. Agent based models are appropriate here because of the complexity of
climate change models and responses.
Build socioeconomic models to evaluate the effectiveness of alternative incentives and policies. Select
pilot areas and locations of the state to test policy programs. Evaluate effectiveness of
adaptation strategies at regular intervals
Build better decision tools to incorporate total cost accounting for local and regional planning decisions,
so that proposed land use change, agricultural policy shifts, water use policies, transportation
decisions, siting of major new industries, etc. have a full assessment of all public costs including
likely carbon/greenhouse gas footprint, and water use. Decision tools should also include
assessments of proposals land use changes in the light of predicted climate changes.

ADP-3. Protection of Ecosystems and Biodiversity

Priorities for Further Research and Analysis
Florida’s coral reef system should be evaluated, to ascertain changes from climate change or
other stressors caused by people and actions taken to alleviate those that would provide greater
resiliency and chances for coral recovery and expansion.
DEP should amend the Southeast Florida Coral Reef Initiative Local Action Strategy to consider
the added stress on coral reefs due to global warming and develop an effective, coordinated
management strategy to increase the protection of the region’s coral reef ecosystem.
FWC and other relevant agencies should expand research and monitoring of coral reef
ecosystems and assess of water quality and its effects on reefs over time.
Ecologically valuable coral reefs identified under Goal 1 above should be protected from
shoreline development, overfishing and overuse, and other impacts to minimize their

disappearance and to enhance their capacity to provide critical nursery habitat for fish and
other organisms, storm surge protection and other public benefits.
The state should make monitoring of ocean pH and calcification rates a part of the coral
monitoring plans in the Tortugas Ecological Reserve, the Florida Keys National Marine
Sanctuary, Biscayne National Park, Florida Middle Grounds, Pulley Ridge and Oculina Bank
Habitat Area of Particular Concern, and other locations around the state.
DEP, DACS and FWC should enhance state monitoring of biogenic reefs such as oyster reefs as
well as valuable shellfish such as scallops and clams for calcification problems.

Priorities for Further Research and Analysis
Priorities for further research may include:5

•

Estimate the absolute and relative vulnerability of species and habitats to climate change
impacts.

•

Determine the anticipated new states of natural communities in the face of climate
change impacts.

•

Assess the potential economic costs and benefits of climate change impacts on
biodiversity, ecosystem processes, functions and services.

•

Determine future costs (including environmental mitigation costs) of beach nourishment
under different sea level rise scenarios. Will these costs be different in areas where
adequate buffers have been established and where the shoreline is lined with high
density development?

•

Assess whether the state needs an Open Beaches Act. The research could address who
owns the beach and what are the public’s rights of access. On eroded shorelines with
bulkheads, what happens to the public’s common law right of access and customary
use?

•

Assess how the Burt Harris Act (takings law) affects the ability to adequately address
coastal protection in an era of rising seas? Is it having a dampening effect on adequate
regulatory policies? Will it increase the cost of implementing adaptation strategies?

•

Asses how can the state legally authorize bulkheading or other armoring that will result
in imperiled species take, violating state and federal endangered species law?

•

Examine how beach access could be affected by climate change.

•

Determine offshore sand availability for renourishment under differing scenarios and
for different regions of the coast.

5 Some of these priorities for research can be found in Florida’s Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy (FWC,
2005) and Florida Ocean and Coastal Council’s 2008‐2009 Scientific Research Plan (FOCC, 2008).

Carolina and Maine) to allow long‐term coastal migration, ecosystem adaptation and public
access.

•

Research to determine quality and quantity effects of sea level rise on ecosystems in
transition.

ADP-5. Built Environment, Infrastructure and Community Protection

Priorities for Further Research and Analysis
Storm Surge:
Although ASCE‐7 and the Florida Building Code prescribe methodology to quantify the main
loads resulting from storm surge, there is very little region or site‐specific information
regarding the behavior of storm surge at specific locations and under the influence of local
impact modifiers. Information such as: the angle of attack of storm surge at a given coastal
location as a function of the direction of travel of a tropical cyclone, the velocity of flow of storm
surge as it approaches a coastal location and the factors that influence such velocity of flow, and
other related information are not readily available or not available at all for building design
professionals to use in establishing design criteria for a specific building.
Research to identify such storm surge behavioral parameters on a basin‐specific basis
throughout the state could provide invaluable information to design professionals.
Research to develop protocols for the removal of abandoned residential, industrial and
municipal structures will be essential to insure these structures do not release contaminants into
coastal waters when inundated by sea level rise.

hurricane frequency and intensity in the Atlantic Basin;

•

Local and regional analysis of shoreline elevation to better predict storm surge using
statewide LIDAR survey data recently completed for the state’s coastline;

•

Annex 4: Values at Risk
In order to assess the vulnerability of the built environment to hazards driven or exacerbated by
climate change, it is essential to define and quantify the value at risk. In this specific case this
refers to the value of the built environment and associated infrastructure.
The value at risk provides a baseline to assess the potential for damage from the impact of
climate‐driven or exacerbated hazards over a given time period, and to identify and evaluate
the cost effectiveness of adaptation alternatives.
Defining the Value at Risk
Before quantifying the value of the built environment that is or may be at risk it is necessary to
first define what is meant by value at risk. In defining the value at risk of the built environment
the following criteria must be considered:
1.

The value of the built environment is dynamic, meaning that it changes over time in
response to a range of factors, such as total population, density of population,
demographics, land use and zoning, the mix of occupancies in a given community or
region, importance or criticality of the functions sheltered by given buildings or
structures, total area of constructed space and others.

2.

The value of the built environment is not limited to the cost of construction of the physical
buildings, facilities and structures, but it is directly affected by the value of the human
activity or function sheltered or supported by components of the built environment in a
given community or region.

3.

The value of the built environment is interlinked with the value of the land on which it is
located. To the degree that buildings change the character of land from vacant to
developed, they also change the value of the land. In this sense the value of the built
environment and the value of property become synonymous.

4.

The value of the built environment is a function of the vulnerability of the location on a
regional and/or a site‐specific basis.

Given the above criteria it is clear that there are several factors to be taken into account to define
the value of the built environment that is at risk of being damaged by the impact of hazards
caused or exacerbated by climate change. With respect to the built environment it is also clear
that defining and quantifying the value at risk can at best be achieved through a series of
snapshots that represent either current conditions or projected conditions based on future
scenarios.
Given the variability of these factors from region to region, or from one community to the next,
it should be noted that the value at risk must be defined by community or regional basis. The

F‐80
Appendix F

2008 Center for Climate Strategies
www.flclimatechange.us

Florida’s Energy and Climate Change Action Plan
______________________________________________________________________________
aggregate of all the regionally defined values at risk constitute the value at risk for the whole
state of Florida.
In essence this means that the definition and quantification of the value at risk, of the built
environment, must be a continuous exercise requiring the establishment of a baseline for a
given region, community or site and periodic updates at specific time intervals.
Quantifying the Value at Risk
Once the value at risk has been defined on the basis of region or community‐specific criteria and
factors the value at risk can be quantified at the community or regional scale.
Quantifying the value at risk provides an essential foundation for the following:
1.

The potential for damage to the built environment, from the impact of climate change
caused or exacerbated hazards can be estimated as a percentage of the value at risk.

2.

The effectiveness and benefits of adaptation measures can be quantified on the basis of
their damage reduction capabilities.

3.

The cost‐effectiveness of adaptation measures can be assessed on the basis of their
respective benefit‐to‐cost ratio.

Quantification of the value at risk [of the built environment] can be based, at a minimum, on the
following parameters:
a)
b)
c)

Replacement Value of Building[s]
Replacement Value of Contents
Criticality Factor: a multiplier reflecting the type of function housed in the building

Use of these parameters is represented by the equation below:
Vr = (C + N) x Fc
Where:
Vr = Value at Risk in current U.S. Dollars
C = Replacement value of building in current $
N = Replacement value of contents in current $
Fc = Criticality factor
Quantification of the value at risk for the built environment can be simplified at the local level,
by quantifying the value on the basis of the type of function sheltered by various buildings,
facilities, and structures. For example, all residential use buildings can be grouped together, the
same as all educational facilities, or health‐care facilities, or government buildings etc. In the
end the aggregate of all the values at risk by type of function will constitute the total value at
risk at the municipal level for example.
