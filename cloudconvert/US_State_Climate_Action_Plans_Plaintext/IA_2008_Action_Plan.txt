Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council
Final Report
12/23/08

December 23, 2008
The Honorable Chester J. Culver and
The State of Iowa General Assembly
State Capitol Building
1007 East Grand Ave
Des Moines, Iowa 50319

Dear Governor Culver and Legislators,
In the 2007 legislative session, you signed into law SF 485, which established the Iowa
Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC). This Council was charged with identifying
policies and strategies for Iowa to respond to the challenge of global climate change by
reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and spurring economic growth through
technological innovation. ICCAC formed subcommittees and considered policy options
in five areas: Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC); Clean and Renewable Energy
(CRE); Transportation and Land Use (TLU); Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste
Management (AFW); and Cross-Cutting Issues (CC). Enclosed is the Final Report of the
Council.
In the Final Report, the Council presents two scenarios designed to reduce statewide
greenhouse gas emissions by 50% and 90% from a 2005 baseline by the year 2050. For
the 50% reduction by 2050, the Council recommends approximately a 1% reduction by
2012 and an 11% reduction by 2020. For the 90% reduction scenario, the Council
recommends a 3% reduction by 2012 and a 22% reduction 2020. These interim targets
were based on a simple extrapolation assuming a linear rate of reduction between now
and 2050.
In providing these scenarios for your consideration, ICCAC approved 56 policy options
from a large number of possibilities. There are more than enough options to reach the
interim and final emission targets in both the 50% and 90% reduction scenarios. Direct
costs and cost savings of these policy options were also evaluated with the help of The
Center for Climate Strategies, who facilitated the process and provided technical
assistance throughout the entire process, and who developed the Iowa Greenhouse Gas
Emissions Inventory and Forecast in close consultation with the Iowa Department of
Natural Resources (IDNR) and many Council and Sub-Committee members. About half
of the policy options presented in this report will not only reduce GHG emissions but are
highly cost-effective and will save Iowans money. Still other options may require

significant investment but will create jobs, stimulate energy independence, and advance
future regional or federal GHG programs.
Please feel free to call upon us if you have questions about the report. We stand ready
and willing to help in any future charge to the Council to prosper our economy and
improve our environment, while reducing Iowa’s greenhouse gas emissions.
Sincerely yours,

Jerald L. Schnoor

Executive Summary
Background
The Iowa General Assembly enacted Senate File 485 in 2007 and House File 2571 in 2008. This
legislation creates the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) which consists of
twenty-three (23) voting members appointed by the Governor that serve three-year staggered
terms. The Council is also comprised of four (4) non-voting, ex-officio members from the
General Assembly.
As specified in Iowa Code section 455B.851, “The council shall submit the greenhouse gas
emission reduction proposals to the governor and the general assembly by January 1, 2009.” The
proposals include the following:
•

After consideration of a full range of policies and strategies, including the costeffectiveness of the strategies, the council shall develop multiple scenarios designed to
reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent and ninety percent by 2050.”

•

The Council shall also develop short-term, medium-term, and long-term scenarios
designed to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions and shall consider the costeffectiveness of the scenarios.

•

The Council shall establish 2005 as the baseline year for purposes of calculating
reductions in statewide greenhouse gas emissions.

The ICCAC began its deliberative process at its second meeting on December 17, 2007
following an organizational meeting via teleconference on October 15, 2007. ICCAC met a total
of eight times, with the final in-person meeting held on November 10, 2008, followed by a
conference call on December 10, 2008 for review of this report. About 75 additional
teleconference meetings of ICCAC’s five supporting Subcommittees (SCs) were also held to
identify and analyze various potential policy actions in advance of the ICCAC’s November 10,
2008, final decisional meeting.
The five SCs considered information and potential policy options in the following sectors:
•

Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC)

•

Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE)

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW); and

•

Cross-Cutting Issues (CC) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) provided facilitation and technical assistance to the
ICCAC and each of the SCs. The SCs consisted of ICCAC members and selected additional
members. Members of the public were invited to observe and provide input at all meetings of the

ES-1

ICCAC and SCs. The SCs served as advisers to the ICCAC and helped generate initial options
on Iowa-specific policy options to be added to the catalog of existing state actions; priority
policy options for analysis; draft proposals on the design characteristics and quantification of the
proposed policy options; specifications and assistance for analysis of draft policy options
(including best available data sources, methods and assumptions); and other key elements of
policy option proposals, including related policies and programs, key uncertainties, co-benefits
and costs, feasibility issues, and potential barriers to consensus.

Key Outcomes
In fulfillment of the requirements of this legislation the Council has prepared this Report which
includes the following key outcomes:
•

The Iowa Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Inventory and Forecast has been prepared
which outlines baseline conditions as of 2005 1 and projected emissions through 2025 if
no changes to the business as usual reference case are made. These projections were
prepared in close consultation with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR)
and many Council and Sub-Committee members offered specific recommended
improvements during its development. ICCAC recommends that the GHG Emissions
Inventory and Forecast be updated annually.

•

Approval of a comprehensive package of multi-sector policy options to reduce GHG
emissions and address related energy and commerce issues in Iowa. ICCAC approved 56
policy options for inclusion in this Final Report. The ICCAC Members present and
voting approved 32 of these policy options unanimously, approved 11 more with a supermajority vote (support of 80% or more of the members present and voting ), and 13
additional options with a simple majority supporting it. One option failed to gain ICCAC
approval. Explanations of objections are in included in Appendices F through J of this
Report, which contain detailed accounts of the ICCAC’s options along with descriptions
of key uncertainties in the analysis.

•

Evaluation of the direct costs and direct cost savings of the policy options in Iowa. The
ICCAC analyzed quantitatively the direct costs or cost savings of 37 of its 56 policy
options. Although the total net cost associated with the 37 policies analyzed is estimated
at about $ 4.8 billion between 2009 and 2020, the weighted-average cost-effectiveness of
the 37 policies is estimated to be approximately $8.80/tCO2e reduced. Many of the
policies are estimated to yield significant cost-saving opportunities for Iowans. Other
policies will incur net costs.

•

The Council developed two GHG Reduction Scenarios. One scenario was specified by
the enabling legislation to achieve a 50% reduction from the baseline year [2005] by
2050. The Council developed a second GHG reduction scenario to achieve a 90% GHG
reduction below the 2005 baseline year by 2050. The Council chose 2012 and 2020 as its
short-term and mid-term intervals, respectively.

1

Year 2005 was selected as the base year for the GHG reduction scenarios and cost-effectiveness analysis
because emissions inventory data are more complete for year 2005 than for previous years.

ES-2

•

For a 50% reduction by 2050 scenario the Council recommends approximately a 1%
reduction by 2012 and an 11% reduction by 2020. For the 90% reduction scenario the
Council recommends approximately a 3% reduction by 2012 and a 22 % reduction by
2020. For both scenarios, a simple linear extrapolation was used from Iowa’s estimated
2009 emissions to the targets of 50% and 90% reductions in 2050, which allowed
delineation of interim targets for each scenario in 2012 and 2020. The assumption of
linearity was made because there were plenty of reductions in the approved policy
options to achieve the interim targets, and a more extensive analysis was beyond the
scope of this report. The ICCAC based its options on its review of the potential overall
emission reduction estimates (as compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast)
for 38 of 56 policy options for which emission reductions were quantified, and its review
of goals and targets adopted by several other states. Of the 56 policy options, 38 were
analyzed quantitatively to have a cumulative effect of reducing emissions by about 20
million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2012 and 105
(MMtCO2e) in 2020. Together, if the 38 quantified policy options and the recent federal
and state actions (or their functional equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2020
emission reduction scenario is achievable based on results of analysis of ICCAC
proposals conducted through the ICCAC and Subcommittee process.

•

In addition, the ICCAC recommends that the state report biennially to the Governor and
the state legislature on the state’s progress in reducing GHG emissions under these
scenarios.

Iowa GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
In April 2008, CCS completed a draft GHG emissions inventory and reference case projection to
assist the ICCAC and SCs in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG emissions in
Iowa, and thereby inform the policy development process. 2 The ICCAC and SCs reviewed,
discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and projections methodologies, as well as alternative
data and approaches for improving the draft inventory and projections. The final report 3
incorporating comments provided by the Subcommittees that were approved by the ICCAC at
their September 2008 meeting and incorporated into the final report during October, is available
at: http://www.iaclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm . At the 7th ICCAC meeting
in November 2008 the Council received the final I-F Report and agreed to file and forward it to
the Governor and Legislature.
The inventory and reference case projections included detailed coverage of all economic sectors
and GHGs in Iowa, including future emission trends and assessment issues related to energy, the

economy, and population growth. It is important to note that the emission estimates reflect the
GHG emissions associated with the electricity sources used to meet Iowa’s demands,
corresponding to a consumption-based approach to emissions accounting. Another way to look at
electricity emissions is to consider the GHG emissions produced by electricity generation
facilities in the state—a production-based method. The study covers both methods of accounting
for emissions, but for consistency, all total results are reported as consumption-based.
As illustrated in Figure ES-1, under the reference case projections, Iowa’s gross GHG emissions
continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 148 MMtCO2e by 2025, 52% above 1990 levels.
This equates to a 1.1% annual rate of growth from 2005 to 2025. Relative to 2005, the share of
emissions associated with electricity consumption and the transportation sector both increase
slightly to 32% and 20%, respectively, in 2025. The share of emissions from the industrial
processes and fossil fuel industry sectors is projected to increase to 6% and 3%, respectively, by
2025. The share of emissions from the RCI fuel use sector and the waste management sector is
projected to remain the same at about 20% and 2%, respectively, of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions
in 2025. The agriculture sector is the only sector in Iowa whose emission share in 2025 is
projected to decrease from its emission share in 2005 (from 23% in 2005 to 17% in 2025).
Emissions associated with electricity consumption are projected to be the largest contributor to
future GHG emissions growth, followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector,
as shown in Figure 2-4. Other sources of emissions growth include the RCI fuel use sector and
the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in
refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The agriculture sector is the only sector in
which emissions are projected to decrease from 2005 to 2025. Table 2-2 summarizes the growth
rates that drive the growth in the Iowa reference case projections, as well as the sources of these
data. Figure ES-2 depicts the 2005 distribution of sources in Iowa compared to the United States
(U.S.) .
Estimates of carbon sinks within Iowa’s forests, including urban forests and land use changes as
well as agricultural soils, have also been included in this report. The current estimates indicate
that about 27 MMtCO2e were stored in Iowa soils, forests and agricultural biomass in 2005.
When all statewide emission sources and sinks are considered, this leads to net emissions of 92
MMtCO2e in Iowa in 2005, an amount equal to 1.4% of total US net GHG emissions.

Recent Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) was signed into law in
December 2007. This law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they
are implemented over the next few years. During the ICCAC process, sufficient information was
identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with
implementing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements and energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting associated with the EISA's Title IV (Energy
Savings in Buildings and Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in Government and Public
Institutions) requirements in Iowa.
Iowa has recently embarked on statewide public sector energy efficiency initiatives in response
to concerns about energy costs. The state is implementing two energy efficiency initiatives under
Executive Orders 6 and 41. Executive Order 06 4 by Governor Culver establishes a Green
Government Initiative in Iowa that is targeted at three areas (buildings, materials and biofuels).
Several Task Forces have been established to address the specific areas. Executive Order 41 5 by
Governor Vilsack requires that all state agencies reduce energy consumption in state buildings.
Together, these federal and state requirements are estimated to reduce gross GHG emissions for
all sectors combined in Iowa by about 3.4 MMtCO2e (a 2.4% reduction) from the business-asusual emissions in 2020.
In addition, Iowa utilities have been pursuing energy efficiency programs for some time. These
investments are not quantified in the analysis because EEC subcommittee members indicated
that the energy impacts from these efficiency programs are already incorporated into the utility
load growth forecasts which were used for the reference case inventory and forecast (eg they are
already in the baseline).

ICCAC Policy Options (Beyond Recent Actions)
The ICCAC developed 56 policy options. The ICCAC Members present and voting approved 32
of these policy options unanimously, approved 11 more with a super-majority vote (support of
80% or more of the members present and voting ), and 13 additional options with a simple
majority supporting it. One option failed to gain ICCAC approval and is not included in this
report. At this time these policy options have not been prioritized nor ranked in any order of
preference. Explanations of objections are in included in Appendices F through J of this Report,
which contain detailed accounts of the ICCAC’s options.
Of the 56 policy options, 38 were analyzed quantitatively to have a cumulative effect of reducing
emissions by about 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2012 and
105 (MMtCO2e) in 2020.

Figure ES-3 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the recent federal and state actions and the 38 policy options relative to the
business-as-usual reference case projections. Table ES-1a provides the numeric estimates
underlying Figure ES-3 for the 50% reduction by 2050 scenario and Table ES-1b provides the
same estimate for the 90% reduction scenario by 2050. In Figure ES-3:
•

The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2012,
2015 and 2020) levels of Iowa’ gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis. (The
consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Iowa to meet the state’s demand for electricity)

•

The red line shows projected emissions associated with recent federal and state actions that
were analyzed quantitatively.

•

The green line shows projected emissions if all of the ICCAC’s 38 options that were
analyzed quantitatively with respect to their GHG reduction potential are implemented
successfully and the estimated reductions are fully achieved. (Note that other ICCAC options
would have the effect of reducing emissions, but those reductions were not analyzed
quantitatively, so are not reflected in the green line.)

For the policy options offered by the ICCAC to yield the levels of estimated emission reductions
shown in Table ES-2, they must be implemented in a timely and thorough manner. Table ES-3
depicts the final policy options of the Council and their associated GHG reductions and costs/
savings for each sector.

As explained above, the ICCAC considered the estimates of the GHG reductions that could be
achieved by 38 of its options derived from 2005 baseline data, and the costs (or cost savings) of
37 of the options. Figure ES-4 presents the estimated tons of GHG emission reductions for each
policy option for which estimates were quantified, expressed as a cumulative figure for the
period 2009–2020. In addition to the imprecision in GHG reductions achieved by each policy
option, there are uncertainties about the exact cost (or cost savings) per ton of reduction
achieved. Figure ES-5 presents the estimated dollars-per-ton cost (or cost savings, depicted as a
negative number) for each policy option for which cost estimates were quantified, expressed as a
cumulative figure for the period 2009–2020. This measure is calculated by dividing the net
present value of the cost of the policy option by the cumulative GHG reductions, all for the
period 2009–2020.

Finally, Figure ES-7 presents a graph with a linear extrapolation out to 2050 for the two ICCAC
scenarios; a 50% GHG Reduction scenario [blue line] and a 90% GHG Reduction scenario
[green line]. The 2012 and 2020 intersection points on each of these scenario lines were chosen
for the short and mid-term scenario proposals. For both scenarios, a simple linear extrapolation
was used from Iowa’s estimated 2009 emissions to the targets of 50% and 90% reductions in
2050, which allowed delineation of interim targets for each scenario in 2012 and 2020. The
assumption of linearity was made because there were plenty of reductions in the approved policy
options to achieve the interim targets, and a more extensive analysis was beyond the scope of
this report. For comparative purposes the figure also includes three lines indicating the projected
emissions with three cost-effectiveness projections: for less than $40/T, $15/T and $0/T with
orange, red and blue shades, respectively.

Chapter 1
Background and Overview
Creation of the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council
Iowa Senate File 485
The Iowa General Assembly enacted Senate File 485 in 2007 and House File 2571 in 2008. This
legislation created the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) which consists of
twenty-three (23) voting members appointed by the Governor, and serve three-year staggered
terms. The Council is also comprised of four (4) non-voting, ex-officio members from the
General Assembly.
As specified in Iowa Code section 455B.851, “The council shall submit the greenhouse gas
emission reduction proposals to the governor and the general assembly by January 1, 2009.” The
proposals include the following:
•

After consideration of a full range of policies and strategies, including the cost-effectiveness
of the strategies, the Council shall develop multiple scenarios designed to reduce statewide
greenhouse gas emissions, including one scenario that would reduce such emissions by fifty
percent and ninety percent by 2050.

•

The Council shall also develop short-term, medium-term, and long-term scenarios designed
to reduce statewide greenhouse gas emissions and shall consider the cost-effectiveness of the
scenarios.

•

The Council shall establish 2005 as the baseline year for purposes of calculating reductions
in statewide greenhouse gas emissions

ICCAC’s Response
In fulfillment of the requirements of this legislation ICCAC held eight meetings over the last
fifteen months. Additionally, the Council formed five technical Subcommittees (SCs) to assist
the Council in formulating options. These SCs met numerous times between the ICCAC
meetings. As a result the Council has prepared this Report which includes the following key
outcomes and options:
•

The Iowa Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Inventory and Forecast has been prepared
which outlines baseline conditions as of 20051 and projected emissions through 2025 if no
changes to the business as usual reference case are made. These projections were prepared in
close consultation with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) and many
Council and Sub-Committee members offered specific recommended improvements during
its development. ICCAC recommends that the GHG Emissions Inventory and Forecast be
updated annually.

1

Year 2005 was selected as the base year for the GHG reduction scenarios and cost-effectiveness analysis because
emissions inventory data are more complete for year 2005 than for previous years.

1-1

•

Approval of a comprehensive package of multi-sector policy options to reduce GHG
emissions and address related energy and commerce issues in Iowa. ICCAC approved 56
policy options for inclusion in this Final Report. The ICCAC Members present and voting
approved 32 of these policy options unanimously, approved 11 more with a super-majority
vote (support of 80% or more of the members present and voting ), and 13 additional options
with a simple majority supporting it. One option failed to gain ICCAC approval.
Explanations of objections are in included in Appendices F through J of this Report, which
contain detailed accounts of the ICCAC’s options.

•

Evaluation of the direct costs and direct cost savings of the policy options in Iowa. The
ICCAC analyzed quantitatively the direct costs or cost savings of 37 of its 56 policy options.
Although the total net cost associated with the 37 policies analyzed is estimated at about
$ 4.8 billion between 2009 and 2020, the weighted-average cost-effectiveness of the 37
policies is estimated to be approximately $8.80/tCO2e reduced. Many of the policies are
estimated to yield significant cost-saving opportunities for Iowans. Other policies will incur
net costs.

•

The Council developed two GHG Reduction Scenarios. One scenario was specified by the
enabling legislation to achieve a 50% reduction from the baseline year [2005] by 2050. The
Council developed a second GHG reduction scenario to achieve a 90% GHG reduction
below the 2005 baseline year by 2050. The Council chose 2012 and 2020 as its short-term
and mid-term intervals, respectively. For a 50% reduction by 2050 scenario the Council
recommends a 1% reduction by 2012 and an 11% reduction by 2020. For the 90% reduction
scenario the Council recommends a 3% reduction by 2012 and a 22 % reduction by 2020.
The ICCAC based its options on its review of the potential overall emission reduction
estimates (as compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast) for 38 of 56 policy
Options for which emission reductions were quantified, and its review of goals and targets
adopted by several other states. Of the 56 policy Options, 38 were analyzed quantitatively to
have a cumulative effect of reducing emissions by about 20 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2012 and 105 (MMtCO2e) in 2020. Together, if the 38
quantified policy options and the recent federal and state actions (or their functional
equivalent) are successfully implemented, the 2020 emission reduction scenario based on
results of analysis of ICCAC proposals conducted through the ICCAC and Subcommittee
process is achievable.

•

In addition, the ICCAC recommends that the state report biennially to the Governor and the
state legislature on the state’s progress in reducing GHG emissions under these scenarios.

Recent Actions
GHG Reductions Associated With Recent Federal Actions
The federal Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) was signed into law in
December 2007. This law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they
are implemented over the next few years. During the ICCAC process, sufficient information was
identified (e.g., implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with
implementing the Corporate Average Fuel Economy requirements and energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting associated with the EISA’s Title IV (Energy
Savings in Buildings and Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in Government and Public

1-2

Institutions) requirements in Iowa. The GHG emission reductions projected to be achieved by
these actions are shown in Figure 1-1. Table 1-1 provides the numeric estimates underlying
Figure 1-1.
Recent State Actions
Iowa has recently embarked on statewide energy efficiency programs in response to concerns
about energy costs. The state is implementing two energy efficiency initiatives under Executive
Orders 6 and 41. Executive Order 62 by Governor Culver establishes a Green Government
Initiative in Iowa that is targeted at three areas (buildings, materials and biofuels). Several Task
Forces have been established to address the specific areas. Executive Order 413 by Governor
Vilsack requires that all state agencies reduce energy consumption in state buildings. The
estimated reductions associated with each of these efforts is also incorporated into Figure 1-1 and
Table 1-1.
Together, these federal and state requirements are estimated to reduce gross GHG emissions for
all sectors combined in Iowa by about 3.4 MMtCO2e (a 2.4% reduction) from the business-asusual emissions in 2020.

The ICCAC Process
The ICCAC began its deliberative process at its second meeting on December 17, 2007
following an organizational meeting via teleconference on October 18, 2007. ICCAC met a total
of seven times, with the final decisional meeting held on November 10, 2008, followed by a
conference call on December 10, 2008 for review of this report. About 75 additional
teleconference meetings of ICCAC’s five supporting Subcommittees were also held to identify
and analyze various potential policy actions in advance of the ICCAC’s November 10, 2008 final
decisional meeting.
The five SCs considered information and potential options in the following sectors:
•

Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC);

•

Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE);

•

Transportation and Land Use (TLU);

•

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW); and

•

Cross-Cutting Issues (CC) (i.e., issues that cut across the above sectors).

The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) provided facilitation and technical assistance to the
ICCAC and each of the SCs, based on a detailed proposal approved by the ICCAC. The SCs
consisted of ICCAC members and selected additional members. Members of the public were
invited to observe and provide input at all meetings of the ICCAC and SCs. The SCs served as
advisers to the ICCAC and helped generate initial options on Iowa-specific policy options to be
added to the catalog of existing states actions; priority policy options for analysis; draft proposals
on the design characteristics and quantification of the proposed policy options; specifications and
assistance for analysis of draft policy options (including best available data sources, methods and
assumptions); and other key elements of policy option proposals, including related policies and
programs, key uncertainties, co-benefits and costs, feasibility issues, and potential barriers to
consensus. Where members of a SC did not fully agree on options to the ICCAC, the summary
of their efforts was reported to the ICCAC as a part of its consideration and actions. The ICCAC
then made its decisions after reviewing the SCs’ proposals, including modifications as deemed
appropriate in their judgment.
The ICCAC process employed a model of informed self-determination through a facilitated,
stepwise, fact-based, and consensus-building approach. The process was facilitated by CCS, an
independent, expert facilitation and technical analysis team. It was based on procedures that CCS
has used in a number of other state climate change planning initiatives since 2000, but was
adapted specifically for Iowa. The ICCAC process sought but did not mandate consensus, and it
explicitly documented the level of ICCAC support for policies and key findings through a voting
process established in advance, including barriers to full consensus where they existed on final
consideration of proposed actions.
The 56 policy options (out of more than 300 potential options considered) adopted by the
ICCAC and presented in this report were developed through a stepwise approach that included:
(1) expanding a list existing states actions to include additional Iowa-specific actions; (2)
developing a set of “priority for analysis” options for further development; (3) fleshing these

1-5

proposals out for full analysis by development of “straw proposals” for level of effort, timing and
parties involved in implementation; (4) developing and applying a common framework of
analysis for options, including sector specific guidance and detailed specifications for options
that include data sources, methods and key assumptions; (5) reviewing results of analysis and
modifying proposals as needed to address potential barriers to consensus; (6) finalizing design
and analysis of options to remove barriers to final agreement; and (7) developing other key
elements of policy proposals such as implementation mechanisms, co-benefits, and feasibility
considerations. At the final three meetings of the process, policy options with at least majority
support (defined as less than half of those present objecting) from ICCAC members present were
adopted by the ICCAC and included in this report. The SCs’ options to the ICCAC were
documented and presented to the ICCAC at each ICCAC meeting. All of the ICCAC and SC
meetings were open to the public and all materials for and summaries of the ICCAC and SC
meetings were posted on the ICCAC Web site (www.iaclimatechange.us). A detailed description
of the deliberative process is included in Appendix B.

Analysis of Policy Options
With CCS providing facilitation and technical analysis, the five SCs submitted options for
policies for ICCAC consideration using a “policy option template” conveying the following key
information:
Policy Description
Policy Design (Goals, Timing, Parties Involved)
Implementation Mechanisms
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Key Uncertainties
Additional Benefits and Costs
Feasibility Issues
Status of Group Approval
Level of Group Support
Barriers to Consensus
In its deliberations, the ICCAC reviewed, modified, and reached group agreement on various
policy options. The final versions for each sector, conforming to the policy option templates,
appear in Appendices F through J and constitute the most detailed record of decisions of the
ICCAC. Appendix E describes the methods used for quantification of the 38 policy options that
were analyzed quantitatively. The quantitative analysis produced estimates of the GHG emission
reductions and direct net costs (or cost savings) of implementation of various policies, in terms
of both a net present value from 2009 to 2020 and a dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness).
The key methods are summarized below.
Estimates of GHG Reductions: Using the projection of future GHG emissions (see below) as a
starting point, 38 policy options were analyzed by CCS to estimate GHG reductions attributable
to each policy in the individual years of 2012 and 2020 and cumulative reductions over the

1-6

period 2009–2020. The estimates were prepared in accordance with guidance by the appropriate
SC and the ICCAC, which later reviewed the estimates and, in some cases, directed that they be
revised with respect to such elements as goals, data sources, assumptions, sensitivity analysis,
and methodology. Many policies were estimated to affect the quantity or type of fossil fuel
combusted; others affected methane or CO2 sequestered. Among the many assumptions involved
in this task was identification of the appropriate GHG accounting framework—namely, the
choice between taking a “production-based” approach versus a “consumption-based” approach to
various sectors of the economy.4
Estimates of Costs/Cost Savings: The analyses of 37 policy options included estimates of the
direct cost of those policies, in terms of both net costs or cost savings during 2009–2020 and a
dollars-per-ton cost (i.e., cost-effectiveness). Following is a brief summary of the approach used
to estimate the costs or cost savings associated with the policy options:
•

Discounted and annualized costs or cost savings—Standard approaches were taken here. The
net present value of costs or cost savings was calculated by applying a real discount rate of
5%. Dollars-per-ton estimates were derived as an annualized cost per ton, dividing the
present value cost or savings by the cumulative GHG reduction measured in tons. As was the
case with GHG reductions, the period 2009–2025 was analyzed.

•

Cost savings— Total net costs or savings were estimated through comparison of monetized
costs and savings of policy implementation over time, using discounting. These net costs
could be positive or negative; negative costs indicated that the policy saved money or
produced “cost savings.” Many policies were estimated to create net financial cost savings
(typically through fuel savings and electricity savings associated with new policy actions).

•

Direct vs. indirect effects—Estimates of costs and cost savings were based on “direct effects”
(i.e., those borne by the entities implementing the policy).5 Implementing entities could be
individuals, companies, and/or government agencies. In contrast, conventional cost-benefit
analysis takes the “societal perspective” and tallies every conceivable impact on every entity
in society (and quantifies these wherever possible).

Additional Costs and Benefits: The ICCAC options were guided by four decision criteria that
included GHG reductions and monetized costs and cost savings of various policies, as well as
other potential co-benefits and costs (e.g., social, economic, and environmental) and feasibility
considerations. The SCs were asked to examine the latter two in qualitative terms where deemed
important and quantify them on a case-by-case basis, as needed, depending on need and where
data were readily available.

4

A production-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services produced within the
state, and a consumption-based approach estimates GHG emissions associated with goods and services consumed
within the state. In some sectors of the economy, these two approaches may not result in significantly different
numbers. However, the power sector is notable, in that it is responsible for large quantities of GHG emissions, and
states often produce more or less electricity than they consume (with the remainder attributable to power exports or
imports).
5

“Additional benefits and costs” were defined as those borne by entities other than those implementing the policy
option. These indirect effects were quantified on a case-by-case basis, depending on magnitude, importance, need,
and availability of data.

1-7

Implementation Mechanisms: The analysis for each option (see Appendices F through J) of the
ICCAC includes guidance on the policy instruments or “mechanisms” that were prescribed or
assumed for the policy action. This includes a range of potential mechanisms including, for
instance, funding incentives, codes and standards, voluntary and negotiated agreements, market
based instruments, information and education, reporting and disclosure, and other instruments. In
some cases, the recommended instruments are precise. In other cases, they are more general and
envision further work to develop concrete programs and steps to achieve the goals recommended
by the ICCAC.

Iowa GHG Emissions Inventory and Reference Case Projections
In April 2008, CCS completed a draft GHG emissions inventory and reference case projection to
assist the ICCAC and SCs in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG emissions in
Iowa, and thereby inform the policy development process.6 The ICCAC and SCs reviewed,
discussed, and evaluated the draft inventory and projections methodologies, as well as alternative
data and approaches for improving the draft inventory and projections. The final report
incorporating comments provided by the Subcommittees that were approved by the ICCAC at
their September 2008 meeting and incorporated into the final report during October, is available
at: http://www.iaclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm . At the 7th ICCAC meeting
in November 2008 the Council received the final I-F Report7 and agreed to file and forward it to
the Governor and Legislature.
The inventory and reference case projections included detailed coverage of all economic sectors
and GHGs in Iowa, including future emission trends and assessment issues related to energy, the
economy, and population growth. It is important to note that the emission estimates reflect the
GHG emissions associated with the electricity sources used to meet Iowa’s demands,
corresponding to a consumption-based approach to emissions accounting. Another way to look at
electricity emissions is to consider the GHG emissions produced by electricity generation
facilities in the state—a production-based method. The study covers both methods of accounting
for emissions, but for consistency, all total results are reported as consumption-based.
As illustrated in Figure 1-2, under the reference case projections, Iowa’s gross GHG emissions
continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 148 MMtCO2e by 2025, 52% above 1990 levels.
This equates to a 1.1% annual rate of growth from 2005 to 2025. Relative to 2005, the share of
emissions associated with electricity consumption and the transportation sector both increase
slightly to 32% and 20%, respectively, in 2025. The share of emissions from the industrial
processes and fossil fuel industry sectors is projected to increase to 6% and 3%, respectively, by

2025. The share of emissions from the residential commercial and industrial and commercial
(RCI) fuel use sector and the waste management sector is projected to remain the same at about
20% and 2%, respectively, of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions in 2025. The agriculture sector is the
only sector in Iowa whose emission share in 2025 is projected to decrease from its emission
share in 2005 (from 23% in 2005 to 17% in 2025).
Emissions associated with electricity consumption are projected to be the largest contributor to
future GHG emissions growth, followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector.
Other sources of emissions growth include the RCI fuel use sector and the increasing use of
HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in refrigeration, air conditioning,
and other applications. The agriculture sector is the only sector in which emissions are projected
to decrease from 2005 to 2025. Figure 1-3 depicts the 2005 distribution of sources in Iowa
compared to the United States (U.S.) .
Estimates of carbon sinks within Iowa’s forests, including urban forests and land use changes as
well as agricultural soils, have also been included in this report. The current estimates indicate
that about 27 MMtCO2e were stored in Iowa soils, forests and agricultural biomass in 2005. This
leads to net emissions of 92 MMtCO2e in Iowa in 2005, an amount equal to 1.4% of total US net
GHG emissions.
While Iowa’s estimated emissions growth rate presents challenges, it also provides major
opportunities. Key choices regarding technologies and infrastructure can have a significant
impact on emissions growth in Iowa. The ICCAC’s options document the opportunities for the
state to reduce its GHG emissions, while continuing its strong economic growth by being more
energy efficient, using more renewable energy sources, and increasing the use of cleaner
transportation modes, technologies, and fuels.

ICCAC Policy Options (Beyond Recent Actions)
The ICCAC recommended 56 policy options. The ICCAC Members present and voting approved
32 of these recommended policy options unanimously, approved 11 more with a super-majority
vote (support of 80% or more of the members present and voting ), and 13 additional options
1-10

with a simple majority supporting it. One option failed to gain ICCAC approval. Explanations of
objections are in included in Appendices F through J of this Report, which contain detailed
accounts of the ICCAC’s options.
Of the 56 policy options, 38 were analyzed quantitatively to have a cumulative effect of reducing
emissions by about 20 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) in 2012 and
105 (MMtCO2e) in 2020.
Figure 1-4 presents a graphical summary of the potential cumulative emission reductions
associated with the recent federal actions and the 38 policy options relative to the business-asusual reference case projections. Table 1-2a provides the numeric estimates underlying Figure 14 for the 50% reduction by 2050 scenario and Table 1-2b provides the same estimate for the 90%
reduction scenario by 2050. In Figure 1-4:
•

The blue line shows actual (for 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005) and projected (for 2010, 2012,
2015 and 2020) levels of Iowa’ gross GHG emissions on a consumption basis. (The
consumption-based approach accounts for emissions associated with the generation of
electricity in Iowa to meet the state’s demand for electricity)

•

The red line shows projected emissions associated with recent federal and state actions that
were analyzed quantitatively.

•

The green line shows projected emissions if all of the ICCAC’s 38 options that were
analyzed quantitatively with respect to their GHG reduction potential are implemented
successfully and the estimated reductions are fully achieved. (Note that other ICCAC options
would have the effect of reducing emissions, but those reductions were not analyzed
quantitatively, so are not reflected in the green line.)

For the policy options offered by the ICCAC to yield the levels of estimated emission reductions
shown in Table 1-3, they must be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
Table 1-4 depicts the final policy options of the Council and their associated GHG reductions
and costs/ savings for each sector.

Chapter 2
Inventory and Projections of GHG Emissions
Introduction
This chapter summarizes Iowa’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and sinks (carbon storage)
from 1990 to 2025. The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) prepared a draft of Iowa’s GHG
emissions inventory and reference case projections for the Iowa Department of Natural
Resources (Iowa DNR) as part of the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) process.
The draft inventory and reference case projections, completed in April 2008, provided the
ICCAC with an initial, comprehensive understanding of current and possible future GHG
emissions. The draft report was provided to the ICCAC and its Subcommittees (SCs) to assist
them in understanding past, current, and possible future GHG emissions in Iowa, and thereby
inform the policy option development process. The ICCAC and SCs have reviewed, discussed,
and evaluated the draft inventory and methodologies, as well as alternative data and approaches
for improving the draft GHG inventory and forecast. The inventory and forecast have since been
revised to address the comments provided by the ICCAC.
The information in this chapter reflects the information presented in the final Iowa Greenhouse
Gas Inventory and Reference Case Projections report (hereafter referred to as the Inventory and
Projections report).1 The final report, incorporating comments provided by the Subcommittees
that were approved by the ICCAC at their September 2008 meeting and incorporated into the
final report during October, is available at:
http://www.iaclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm . At the 7th ICCAC meeting in
November 2008 the Council received the final I-F Report and agreed to file and forward it to the
Governor and Legislature.
Historical GHG emission estimates (1990 through 2005)2 were developed using a set of
generally accepted principles and guidelines for state GHG emission inventories, relying to the
extent possible on Iowa-specific data and inputs. The reference case projections (2006–2025) are
based on a compilation of various existing projections of electricity generation, fuel use, and
other GHG-emitting activities, along with a set of simple, transparent assumptions described in
the final Inventory and Projections report.
The Inventory and Projections report covers the six types of gases included in the U.S. GHG
inventory: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons
(HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). Emissions of these GHGs are
presented using a common metric, CO2 equivalence (CO2e), which indicates the relative

contribution of each gas, per unit mass, to global average radiative forcing on a global warming
potential-weighted basis.3
It is important to note that the emission estimates reflect the GHG emissions associated with the
electricity sources used to meet Iowa’s demands, corresponding to a consumption-based
approach to emissions accounting. Another way to look at electricity emissions is to consider the
GHG emissions produced by electricity generation facilities in the state—a production-based
method. The study covers both methods of accounting for emissions, but for consistency, all total
results are reported as consumption-based.

Iowa GHG Emissions: Sources and Trends
Table 2-1 provides a summary of GHG emissions estimated for Iowa by sector for 1990, 2000,
2005, 2010, 2020, and 2025. As shown in this table, Iowa is estimated to be a net source of GHG
emissions (positive, or gross, emissions). Iowa’s forests serve as sinks of GHG emissions
(removal of emissions, or negative emissions). Iowa’s net emissions are derived by subtracting
the CO2 equivalent emissions in sinks from the gross GHG emission totals. The following
sections discuss GHG emission sources and sinks, trends, projections, and uncertainties.

Historical Emissions
Overview
In 2005, on a gross emissions consumption basis (i.e., excluding carbon sinks), activities in Iowa
accounted for approximately 120 million metric tons (MMt) of CO2e emissions, an amount equal
to 1.7% of total U.S. gross GHG emissions. On a net emissions basis (i.e., including carbon
sinks), activities in Iowa accounted for approximately 92 MMtCO2e of emissions in 2005, an
amount equal to 1.4% of total U.S. net GHG emissions.4 Iowa’s GHG emissions are rising faster
than those of the nation as a whole. From 1990 to 2005, Iowa’s gross GHG emissions increased
by 23%, while national gross emissions rose by 16%.5 Table 2-1, below, presents Iowa’s
historical and reference case GHG emissions by sector for

Changes in the atmospheric concentrations of GHGs can alter the balance of energy transfers between the
atmosphere, space, land, and the oceans. A gauge of these changes is called radiative forcing, which is a simple
measure of changes in the energy available to the Earth–atmosphere system. Holding everything else constant,
increases in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere will produce positive radiative forcing (i.e., a net increase in the
absorption of energy by the Earth). See: Boucher, O., et al. "Radiative Forcing of Climate Change." Chapter 6 in
Climate Change 2001: The Scientific Basis. Contribution of Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change Cambridge University Press. Cambridge, United Kingdom. Available at:
http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/212.htm.

The national emissions used for these comparisons are based on 2005 emissions from U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990–2006, April 15, 2008, EPA430R-08-005. Available at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/usinventoryreport.html.

During this period, population grew by 6% in Iowa and by 19% nationally. However, Iowa’s economy grew at a
faster rate on a per capita basis (up 51% vs. 33% nationally).

In Iowa, gross CO2e emissions on a per capita basis were about 40 metric tons (t) of gross CO2e
in 2005, higher than the national per capita emissions of about 24 tCO2e in 2005. Figure 2-1
illustrates the state’s emissions per capita and per unit of economic output. It also shows that
while per-capita emissions have increased from 1990 to 2005 in Iowa, per capita emissions for
the nation as a whole remained fairly flat from 1990 to 2005. The higher per capita emission
rates in Iowa are due in part to emissions in the agricultural industry (agricultural industry
emissions are much higher than the national average) and a lower population density (due to a
larger rural area) in Iowa relative to the US as a whole.6 In both Iowa and the nation as a whole,
economic growth exceeded emissions growth throughout the 1990–2005 period. From 1990 to
2005, emissions per unit of gross product dropped by 26% nationally, and by 24% in Iowa.7

Based on information from the US Census Bureau (http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/19000.html), Iowa has
55,869 square miles, which is 1.6% of the nation’s 3,537,438 square miles. In 2005, Iowa had a population density
of 53.3 persons per square mile, as compared with 84.7 persons per square mile for the US.

Figure 2-2 compares gross GHG emissions estimated for Iowa to emissions for the U.S. for
2005. The principal sources of Iowa’s GHG emissions in 2005 are electricity consumption (31%
of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions); agriculture (23% of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions); residential,
commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use (20% of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions); and
transportation (17% of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions). Figure 2-2 also shows that the industrial
processes sector in Iowa accounted for 4% of gross GHG emissions in 2005. These emissions are
rising due to the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons.8 Other industrial process emissions include CO2 released by cement and
lime manufacturing; CO2 released during soda ash, limestone, and dolomite use; CO2 released
during ammonia, urea, and iron and steel production; N2O released during nitric acid production;
and SF6 released from transformers used in electricity transmission and distribution systems.
Also, landfills and wastewater management facilities produce CH4 and N2O emissions that
accounted for 2% of total gross GHG emissions in Iowa in 2005. Similarly, emissions associated
with the production, processing, transmission, and distribution of fossil fuels accounted for 2%
of the gross GHG emissions in 2005.

8

Chlorofluorocarbons are also potent GHGs; however, they are not included in GHG estimates because of concerns
related to implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Affect the Ozone Layer. See Appendix I in
the Final Inventory and Projections report for Iowa
(http://www.iaclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm).

Notes: Res/Com = Residential and commercial fuel use sectors. Emissions for the residential,
commercial, and industrial fuel use sectors are associated with the direct use of fuels (natural gas,
petroleum, coal, and wood) to provide space heating, water heating, process heating, cooking, and other
energy end-uses. The commercial sector accounts for emissions associated with the direct use of fuels
by, for example, hospitals, schools, government buildings (local, county, and state) and other commercial
establishments. The industrial processes sector accounts for emissions associated with manufacturing
and excludes emissions included in the industrial fuel use sector. The transportation sector accounts for
emissions associated with fuel consumption by all on-road and non-highway vehicles. Non-highway
vehicles include jet aircraft, gasoline-fueled piston aircraft, railway locomotives, boats, and ships.
Emissions from non-highway agricultural and construction equipment are included in the industrial sector.
Emissions associated with forest wildfires and rangeland burning were not calculated for Iowa due to a
lack of data on acreage burned.
Electricity = Electricity generation sector emissions on a consumption basis, including emissions
associated with electricity imported from outside of Iowa and excluding emissions associated with
electricity exported from Iowa to other states.

Forestry emissions refer to the net CO2 flux9 from forested lands in Iowa, which account for
about 8% of the state’s land area.10 Iowa’s forests are estimated to be net sinks of CO2 emissions
in the state, reducing net GHG emissions by 16 MMtCO2e in 2005. In addition, estimates of net
carbon fluxes from agricultural soil cultivation practices are estimated to be net sinks of CO2
emissions in Iowa, reducing net GHG emissions by 11 MMtCO2e in 2005. However, the

9

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Inventory and Projections report does not consider above-ground carbon sequestration in
agriculture because it is not considered to be sequestered.11

Reference Case Projections
Relying on a variety of sources for projections, as noted in the Inventory and Projections report,
a simple reference case projection of GHG emissions through 2025 was developed. As illustrated
in Figure 2-3 and shown numerically in Table 2-1, under the reference case projections, Iowa’s
gross GHG emissions continue to grow steadily, climbing to about 148 MMtCO2e by 2025, 52%
above 1990 levels. This equates to a 1.1% annual rate of growth from 2005 to 2025. Relative to
2005, the share of emissions associated with electricity consumption and the transportation
sector both increase slightly to 32% and 20%, respectively, in 2025. The share of emissions from
the industrial processes and fossil fuel industry sectors is projected to increase to 6% and 3%,
respectively, by 2025. The share of emissions from the RCI fuel use sector and the waste
management sector is projected to remain the same at about 20% and 2%, respectively, of Iowa’s
gross GHG emissions in 2025. The agriculture sector is the only sector in Iowa whose emission
share in 2025 is projected to decrease from its emission share in 2005 (from 23% in 2005 to 17%
in 2025).
Emissions associated with electricity consumption are projected to be the largest contributor to
future GHG emissions growth, followed by emissions associated with the transportation sector,
as shown in Figure 2-4. Other sources of emissions growth include the RCI fuel use sector and
the increasing use of HFCs and PFCs as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances in
refrigeration, air conditioning, and other applications. The agriculture sector is the only sector in
which emissions are projected to decrease from 2005 to 2025. Table 2-2 summarizes the growth
rates that drive the growth in the Iowa reference case projections, as well as the sources of these
data.

11

Above-ground carbon re-enters the natural carbon cycle and is lost to the atmosphere through respiration or
decomposition either directly or indirectly (e.g., used as energy as animal feed or by humans) over relatively short
periods of time (months to years). Carbon sequestration in agriculture is below ground in the form of soil carbon
(i.e., the result of the photosynthesis process), where carbon can be stored over long periods of time (potentially
indefinitely). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Web sites
http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/ccyle.html and http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/local_scale.html have some
useful information. For additional information on the potential for sequestration in agriculture, see EPA’s
Greenhouse Gas Mitigation Potential in U.S. Forestry and Agriculture
(http://www.epa.gov/sequestration/pdf/greenhousegas2005.pdf).

A Closer Look at the Four Major Sources: Electricity Consumption; Agriculture;
Residential, Commercial, Industrial (RCI) Fuel Consumption; and Transportation
Electricity Consumption Sector
As shown in Figure 2-2, electricity use in 2005 accounted for 31% of Iowa’s gross GHG
emissions (about 38 MMtCO2e), which was slightly lower the national share of emissions from
electricity generation (34%). On a per-capita basis, Iowa’s GHG emissions from electricity
consumption are higher than the national average (in 2005, 12.7 tCO2e per capita in Iowa, versus
8.1 tCO2e per capita nationally). Electricity generated by plants located in Iowa comes primarily
from coal (71% in 2005), while virtually all of the rest comes from nuclear (17% in 2005), wind
and hydroelectric (6% in 2005), and natural gas (5% in 2005).
In 2005, emissions associated with Iowa’s electricity consumption (38 MMtCO2e) were about
1.3 MMtCO2e higher than those associated with electricity production (36.3 MMtCO2e). The
higher level for consumption-based emissions reflects GHG emissions associated with net
imports of electricity from other states to meet Iowa’s electricity demand.12 In some historical
and forecast years, Iowa is an electricity importing state. In other years, Iowa is an electricity
exporting state—when its total gross generation by the in-state power plants exceeds the annual
demand for electricity in the state. The reference case projection assumes that production-based
emissions (associated with electricity generated in-state) will increase by about 5 MMtCO2e
between 2005 and 2025, and consumption-based emissions (associated with electricity consumed
in-state) will increase by about 10 MMtCO2e.
While estimates are provided for emissions from both electricity production and consumption,
unless otherwise indicated, tables, figures, and totals in this report reflect electricity consumption
emissions. The consumption-based approach can better reflect the emissions (and emission
reductions) associated with activities occurring in the state, particularly with respect to electricity
use (and efficiency improvements), and is particularly useful for decision making. Under this
approach, emissions associated with electricity exported to other states would need to be covered
in those states’ inventories in order to avoid double counting or exclusions. The reference case
forecast for Iowa assumes significant wind generation resources are added and also excludes to
base-load coal plants that are currently at various stages of the permitting and approval process.
The CCS methodology allows new fossil-based generation to be included in the reference case
only when the plants have received all necessary permits which has not occurred for the two coal
plants proposed in Iowa.
Agricultural Sector
The agricultural sector accounts for 23% of the gross GHG emissions in Iowa in 2005. This is
significantly higher than the national average for agricultural emissions in that year (7%).
However, this is not at all surprising considering the importance of the agricultural sector to the
economy in Iowa.

12
Estimating the emissions associated with electricity use requires an understanding of the electricity sources (both
in-state and out-of-state) used by utilities to meet consumer demand. The current estimate reflects some very simple
assumptions, as described in Appendix A of the Inventory and Projections report.

2-10

These emissions primarily come from agricultural soils, manure management, and enteric
fermentation. Agricultural soils can produce GHG emissions from nitrogen fertilizers and
manure as well as from decomposition of crop residues. Manure management can result in CH4
emissions as a result of manure breaking down. Enteric fermentation is the result of normal
digestive processes of livestock; it creates CH4 emissions. All of these processes can result in
emissions of N2O. Emissions from the agricultural sector are projected to decrease by 8%
between 2005 and 2025. This decrease is expected to come primarily from the agricultural soilslivestock and enteric fermentation categories.
Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Fuel Use Sectors
In 2005, combustion of oil, natural gas, coal, and wood in the RCI sectors contributed about 20%
(about 24 MMtCO2e) of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions, slightly lower than the RCI sector
contribution for the nation (22%). Activities in the RCI13 sectors produce GHG emissions when
fuels are combusted to provide space heating, process heating, and energy for other applications.
The residential sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 20% (4.8
MMtCO2e) in 2005, the commercial sector accounted for 15% (3.6 MMtCO2e), and the
industrial sector’s share of total RCI emissions from direct fuel use was 65% (15.7 MMtCO2e).
Overall, emissions for the RCI sectors (excluding those associated with electricity consumption)
are expected to increase by 25% between 2005 and 2025. Emissions from the commercial sector
are projected to increase by 48% from 2005 to 2025. The industrial sector is predicted to have a
29% increase. In contrast, emissions from the residential sector are expected to decrease slightly
(1%) between 2005 and 2025.
Transportation Sector
As shown in Figure 2-2, the transportation sector accounted for about 17% of Iowa’s gross GHG
emissions in 2005 (about 21 MMtCO2e), which was significantly lower than the national average
share of emissions from transportation fuel consumption (27%). The GHG emissions associated
with Iowa’s transportation sector increased by 3.8 MMtCO2e between 1990 and 2005.
From 1990 through 2005, Iowa’s GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily
at an average rate of about 1.4% annually. In 2005, onroad gasoline vehicles accounted for about
63% of transportation GHG emissions. Onroad diesel vehicles accounted for another 28% of
emissions. Air and marine travel, rail, and other sources (natural gas- and liquefied petroleum
gas- (LPG-) fueled-vehicles used in transport applications) accounted for the remaining 9% of
transportation emissions. GHG emissions from onroad gasoline use increased 14% between 1990
and 2005. Meanwhile, GHG emissions from onroad diesel use rose 44% during that period,
suggesting rapid growth in freight movement within or across the State.
Emissions from on-road gasoline vehicles are projected to increase by 1.4% annually from 2005
to 2025, and emissions from on-road diesel vehicles are projected to increase by 2.8% annually
from 2005 to 2025. Total transportation emissions are expected to reach 29 MMtCO2e by 2025,
at a 1.6% annual rate of growth from 2005.

13

The industrial sector also includes emissions associated with agricultural energy use.

ICCAC Revisions
The ICCAC made the following revisions to the inventory and reference case projections, which
explain the differences between the final Inventory and Projections report and the draft initial
assessment completed during April 2008:14
Energy Supply:
•

•
•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•

The inventory now includes MidAmerican Energy Company’s 25% ownership of the 1,700
megawatt (MW) Quad Cities Station nuclear plant in Illinois. This equates to about 3,350
gigawatt-hours (GWh) at 90% capacity. In both the inventory and reference case projections,
this generation has been treated as an in-state resource because of its ownership status.
A revised load growth forecast for Iowa provided by the Iowa utilities has been used.
The AEO 2007 growth forecast data for MAPP region generation in the draft I&F was
updated with data from AEO 2008.
In the initial analysis, Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast data of the MidContinent Area Power Pool (MAPP) region was used to project the electricity generation
growth by fuel type in Iowa. In this report, added/retired electricity generation capacities
provided by the Iowa utilities was used to project the electricity generation by fuel type in
Iowa for the forecast years.
Added the 790 MW Walter Scott, Jr. supercritical coal plant that came online in 2007;
Added the 1284.3 MW new wind capacities of MidAmerican between 2005-2009;
Included the minority, Iowa share of the uprate for the Duane Arnold Energy Center that is
scheduled to be completed in 2009, resulting in approximately a 10 MW capacity increase;
Added the 200 MW Alliant Franklin County (Whispering Willow) wind farm (will be on the
line by 2010);
Added the 2010 Corn Belt 71 MW wind capacity; and
Included 100 MW of new wind capacity each year from 2014 to 2020, in response to the
Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE) SC’s request to extrapolate the 2008-2013 wind
installation (average of 100 MW per year) to the future.

In addition to the reference case, two sensitivity cases were analyzed for electricity supply.
Sensitivity Analysis Case 1 added the following new capacities, in addition to those new
capacities added in the reference case:
• The 649 MW Marshalltown coal plant;
• The 10% biomass co-firing requirement;
• The retirement of the Lansing units;
• Fuel switching in the Dubuque Generating Station Units from coal to natural gas; and
• Alliant 200 MW new wind capacity by 2013.
Sensitivity Analysis Case 2 added the following new capacity, in addition to those new
capacities added in the reference case and those added in Sensitivity Analysis Case 1:
• The 750 MW Elk Run plant.
14

In addition, a minor change was made to the transportation sector reference case projection emissions. This was
done to correct the growth rate for marine gasoline fuel consumption to reflect the historical marine gas
consumption trend, leading to a decrease of 0.03 MMtCO2e in the marine emissions.

Agriculture:
•

The estimation of soil carbon flux due to cultivation practices has been revised using a year
2000 estimate of the soil carbon sequestration in Iowa. This comes from a publication by
William Stigliani, which references a 2001 study of soil carbon in Iowa. This replaced the
United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 1997 soil carbon estimates used for the
initial analysis.

Key Uncertainties
Some data gaps exist in this inventory, and particularly in the reference case projections. Key
tasks for future refinement of this inventory and forecast include review and revision of key
drivers, such as the electricity demand, agricultural activities, RCI fuel use, and transportation
growth rates that will be major determinants of Iowa’s future GHG emissions (see Table 2-2 and
Figure 2-4). These growth rates are driven by uncertain economic, demographic and land use
trends (including growth patterns and transportation system impacts), all of which deserve closer
review and discussion.

Chapter 3
Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Activities in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors produce greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions when fuels are combusted to provide space heating, process heating, and other
applications. In 2005, combustion of oil, natural gas, coal, and wood in the RCI sectors
contributed about 26% (about 24 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent [MMtCO2e])
of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions. In 2005, this sector was the second largest source of GHG
emissions in the state, following the electricity supply sector (37 MMTCO2e). 1 In addition,
industrial process (nonfuel use) emissions are forecasted to nearly double by 2020, primarily due
to the increasing use of hydrofluorocarbons as substitutes for ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons. Together, industrial process emissions, including cement production and
chemical manufacturing, will account for an additional 5.6% of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions
(8.14 MMtCO2e).
Considering only the direct emissions that occur within buildings and industries, however,
ignores the fact that nearly all electricity sold in the state is consumed as the result of RCI
activities. If the emissions from all three subsectors of RCI are included (i.e., direct fuel use,
emissions associated electricity consumption, and industrial processes), they total about 70% of
the state’s gross GHG emissions in 2005. Therefore, the state’s future GHG emissions will
depend heavily on future trends in the consumption of electricity and other fuels in these sectors.
Figure 3-1 shows the growth in GHG emissions by sector through 2025, including electricity use.
For the 15-year period from 2005 to 2020, GHG emissions are expected to grow the fastest in the
electricity sector, which is forecasted to grow at a 1.0% annual rate. GHG emissions in the
residential sector are expected to grow at 0.6%, the commercial sector at 2.2%, and the industrial
sector at slightly more than 1% a year.
Much of the growth in GHG emissions over the period can be attributed an average 1.9% annual
growth in electricity demand over the 2005–2020 period for the RCI sectors. However,
electricity-related GHG emissions are projected to grow by only 1.0% per year, due to the
addition of significant wind generation resources in the reference case.

1

Emissions associated with the electricity supply sector (discussed in Chapter 4) have been allocated to each of the
RCI sectors for comparison of those emissions to the emissions associated with direct fuel consumption. Note that
this comparison is provided for information purposes, and that emissions estimated for the electricity supply sector
are not double counted in the total emissions for the state.

Figure 3-2 shows the growth in GHG emissions by fuel type through 2025. For the 15-year
period 2005–2020, emissions in the sector are dominated by electricity supply, which rise by
15% from 37 MMtCO2e in 2005 to 43 MMtCO2e in 2020. Direct emissions from coal are
forecasted to increase slightly at a rate of 0.6% per year (not including coal use for electricity
generation). Emissions from natural gas explode, rising 2.9% per year. The emissions data from
natural gas mask large differences in the growth of the use of this fuel. Residential natural gas
consumption is expected to stay nearly constant from 2005 to 2020, while commercial and
industrial gas use is expected to increase by 3.3% and 4.6% per year, respectively.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The principal means to reduce RCI emissions include improving energy efficiency, substituting
electricity and natural gas with lower-emission energy resources (such as biomass and wind), and
implementing various strategies to decrease the emissions associated with electricity production
(see Chapter 4, Clean and Renewable Energy [CRE]). The state’s aggressive pursuit of energy
efficiency in recent years gives stakeholders valuable experience with policymatic efforts to
reduce emissions through programs and initiatives to improve the efficiency of buildings,
appliances, and industrial practices. While the gas and electricity sectors in Iowa have been
securing energy efficiency supplies that are the cheapest source of new resources, recent reports
indicate that there is still untapped “low-hanging fruit” remaining in the form of low-cost energy
efficiency opportunities in the RCI sectors. Programmatic efforts to harvest these resources are
likely to create significant green collar jobs scoping, implementing, and evaluating energy
efficiency projects.

3-3

Electric utilities in Iowa are required by law to offer cost-effective energy efficiency programs
(Iowa Code §§ 476.6(14)). Also, Iowa investor owned utilities (IOUs) have a long history of
conducting demand-side management (DSM) programs, under statutes adopted in 1990 and
modified in 1996. Municipal and rural electric cooperatives have a more mixed history offering
energy efficiency programs. The Iowa Utilities Board is reviewing IOU plans on the effects of
goals equivalent to saving an additional 1.5% of retail electric sales in Iowa annually. Currently,
IOUs achieve new (incremental) savings equivalent to 0.8% of electricity and natural gas sales.
The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) —through the work of its Energy
Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) Subcommittee—has identified significant opportunities for
reducing GHG emissions growth attributable to the RCI sectors in Iowa. These include
expanding or launching energy efficiency programs for electricity, natural gas, and other directuse fuels; regularly updating building codes; expanding the use of combined heat and power
applications; and requiring state and local governments to implement beyond-code building
practices. The ICCAC has also identified significant opportunities to reduce GHG emissions
through policies addressing electricity production, such as tapping into the state’s large biomass
and wind potential (detailed in Chapter 4).

Overview of Policy s and Estimated Impacts
The ICCAC presents, with varying levels of support, a set of 14 policies for the RCI sectors that
offer significant, cost-effective GHG emissions reductions within the state. These options and
results are summarized in Table 3.1. The GHG emission reductions and costs per ton of GHG
reductions for 14 of these policies were quantified. The quantified policy options could lead to
emission savings from reference case projections of:
•

8.5 MMtCO2e per year by 2020, and a cumulative savings of 43 MMtCO2e from 2009 to
2020, and

•

Net cost savings of over $1.0 billion through 2020 on a net present value basis.2 The
weighted-average costs of these policies are a net savings of nearly $25/MMtCO2e.

Because most energy use occurs in buildings, the recommended policies center on improving
energy efficiency in buildings. There is overlap among the policies as to the types of activities
and equipment they cover, but the text following Table 3-1 provides general guidance on how
the policies complement each other.
Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) policy option EEC-1 increases the human capital
component of energy efficiency by providing education and training for energy users across the
state. Similarly, EEC-7 trains builders and developers in the use of energy efficiency
technologies and building practices. EEC-2 and EEC-12 are the most general recommended
policies that deploy DSM natural gas measures and energy efficiency across all types of energy
use: space conditioning, windows, appliances, and water heating and other end uses and
technologies. Efficiency improvements occur through improvements in building shells (EEC-4,
2

The net cost savings, shown in constant 2005 dollars, are based on fuel expenditures; operations, maintenance, and
administrative costs; and amortized, incremental equipment costs. All net present value analyses here use a 5% real
discount rate.

The numbering used to denote the above policy options is for reference purposes only; it does not reflect prioritization

The policy options also differ among the customer classes they target. EEC-13 requires
government to lead the rest of the state by example by requiring that new construction and
retrofits of existing building stock meet high-performance building requirements. EEC-8 targets
low-income residential customers and tenants who typically have less efficient capital equipment
and appliances, but are typically hard to reach for utility energy efficiency programs. 3
There are varying degrees of overlap between policy options which are discussed in more detail
in Appendix F. Government high-performance building standards (EEC-13) typically have little
overlap with utility efficiency programs because government efficiency improvements are
usually implemented via executive orders and procurement standards that might not capture
utility incentives.Peak-demand reductions through smart metering (EEC-11) does not overlap
with other programs that might reduce peak demand through efficient air conditioners under
EEC-12. However, there is overlap in the expected emission reductions and costs among some of
the policies within the RCI sectors, as well as between policies in the RCI and energy supply
(ES) sectors.
For example, EEC-9, the Midwestern Governors Association energy efficiency target, mirrors
the reductions targeted under EEC-2 and EEC-12, so its reductions are eliminated from the
adjusted totals. Also, EEC-8 provides energy efficiency investments for low-income residential
customers. Well-designed utility and nonutility energy efficiency/DSM programs will target
these populations, but not at the level identified under this policy option; therefore, EEC-8 is
assumed to overlap with EEC-2 and EEC-12. Also, incentives to purchase ENERGY STAR
appliances under EEC-14 are expected to overlap with utility and nonutility incentive programs
under EEC-2 and EEC-12.
There is also a potential interaction between the RCI and ES sector policies concerning the clean
energy portfolio components in policy option CRE-8 (Midwestern Governors Association
renewable portfolio standard [RPS]). Under EEC-12, electricity demand in 2020 is reduced by
almost 5,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) versus the reference case. CRE-8b assumes a 20% RPS by
2020, which is 4% more renewable energy sources (as a percentage of retail sales) than is
forecasted under the reference case. Therefore, the implementation of EEC-12 would require 200
GWh fewer of renewable resources to meet the RPS target. Using the renewable energy cost
assumptions for CRE-8b, the reduced spending on renewables that cost more than reference case
generation in 2020 would result in savings of $0.3 million in that year.
Figure 3-3 shows the cumulative emission reductions from the policy options that have been
quantified and produce reductions net of overlaps for the entire planning period for 2009–2020.

*These are the reductions from the Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) policy options,
net of overlaps between options. Each option number is followed by a semicolon and the percent
of total reductions that it represents.

The policy options for the EEC sectors are affected by both state and federal policies that
incentivize or mandate more efficient use of energy. The federal Energy Independence and
Security Act (EISA) of 2007 was signed into law in December 2007. This law contains several
requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they are implemented over the next few years.
During the ICCAC process, sufficient information was identified (e.g., implementation
schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with implementing energy efficiency
requirements for new appliances and lighting in Iowa under Title III of the EISA.
The net effect of these reductions was estimated at 1,300 GWh of electricity and 1,300 billion
British thermal units of natural gas savings in Iowa by 2020. The associated GHG reductions for
these savings are projected to be 1.1 MMtCO2e for 2020 using the EEC carbon dioxide (CO2)
methodology. Note, however, that GHG emission reductions associated with the EISA Title IV
(Energy Savings in Buildings and Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings in Government and
Public Institutions) requirements have not been quantified because of the uncertainties about how
they will be implemented. It is expected that these requirements will overlap with some of the
RCI policy options, especially EEC-4 and EEC-13.
As mentioned in the text below, Iowa utilities have been pursuing energy efficiency programs for
some time. These investments are not quantified in the analysis because EEC subcommittee
members indicated that the energy impacts from these efficiency programs are already
incorporated into the utility load growth forecasts which were used for the reference case
inventory and forecast (eg they are already in the baseline). The assumed incremental (new)
statewide energy efficiency investments are equal to 0.82% of retail natural gas sales, and 0.69%
of electricity sales over the planning period. These investments are deducted from each of the
relevant energy efficiency targets in the individual policy options. For example, energy

3-7

efficiency target in EEC-12 (culminating at 2% of retail sales) is reduced by 0.69% to an
incremental 1.31% of new investments by 2020. This approach avoids double counting
reductions from existing programs in the policy options. Assuming incremental energy
efficiency investments from existing actions in Iowa remained unchanged from 2006 levels,
Iowa’s cumulative electric energy efficiency deployment would be approximately 15% of sales
in 2020. For natural gas, Iowa’s cumulative natural gas energy efficiency deployment would be
approximately 19% of sales in 2020. When using the levelized cost estimate assumptions
developed for the EEC sector, total utility and participant spending on energy efficiency/DSM
from existing actions in the reference case is estimated at $270 million in 2020.
The Iowa Utilities Board is reviewing investor-owned utility plans to increase incremental
electricity and natural gas investments to 1.5% of natural gas and electricity sales. These plans
have not been approved and are therefore not included in the quantitative analyses. However,
these targets are similar to those of options EEC-2 and EEC-12 for natural gas and electricity
with the primary difference that the two ICCAC options escalate to investments equal to 2% of
sales later in the planning period.
Iowa’s Executive Orders #41 (Governor Vilsack) 4 and #6 (Governor Culver) 5 to reduce energy
use in state buildings will also have an impact on future GHG emissions. The avoided electricity
and natural gas GHG emissions are estimated at about 0.30 MMtCO2e in 2020. The policy
options described briefly below, and in more detail in Appendix F, not only result in significant
emission reductions and costs savings, but also offer a host of additional benefits as well. These
benefits include savings to consumers and businesses on energy bills, which can have
macroeconomic benefits; reduction in spending on energy by low-income households; reduced
peak demand, electricity system capital and operating costs, risk of power shortages, energy
price increases, and price volatility; improved public health as a result of reduced pollutant and
particulate emissions by power plants; reduced dependence on imported fuel sources; and green
collar employment expansion and economic development.
For these policies recommended by the ICCAC to yield the levels of savings described here, they
must be implemented in a timely and thorough manner. This means, for example, not only
putting the policies themselves in place, but also attending to the development of “supporting
policies” that are needed to help make the recommended policies effective. While the adoption
of the recommended policies can result in considerable benefits to Iowa’s environment and
consumers, careful, comprehensive, and detailed planning and implementation, as well as
consistent support, of these policies will be required if these benefits are to be achieved.

Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Policy Descriptions

EEC-1

Consumer Education Programs

With a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents a broad climate change and GHG reduction
education program. The ultimate effectiveness of emission reduction activities in many cases
depends on providing information and education to consumers regarding the energy and GHG
emission implications of their choices. Public education and outreach, through such
implementing organizations such as the Iowa Energy Center, is vital to fostering a broad
awareness of climate change issues and effects (including co-benefits, such as clean air and
public health) among the state’s citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in
actions to reduce GHG emissions in their personal and professional lives. This option focuses on
public education and outreach to stimulate decisions that yield energy efficiency savings.
Consumer education is an integral component of most existing DSM programs offered by
investor-owned and consumer-owned utilities. The goal of the program is to achieve a 5%
reduction in residential energy consumption by 2020 implemented by the Iowa Office of Energy
Independence, community colleges, secondary schools, building professional trade groups, and
utilities.
EEC-2.

Demand-Side Management (DSM)/Energy Efficiency Programs for Natural Gas

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents the option that Iowa increase the efficiency of
natural gas use in the state through a goal of deploying new energy efficiency and DSM natural
gas measures equal to 1.5% of retail sales by 2015 and 2.0% by 2017. This policy involves
implementing new or expanding existing energy efficiency programs for all sectors, including
the RCI sectors. Iowa’s IOUs are currently conserving 0.8% of sales with new energy efficiency
and DSM measures and have plans to double this to 1.5% by 2015. This measure then expands
those plans to 2.0% in 2017.
EEC-3.

Financial Mechanisms for Energy Efficiency

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents an option for modernizing the financial
mechanisms that could increase energy efficiency provided by relevant utilities and nonutilities.
Incentives for a variety of energy consumers can improve energy performance of buildings,
equipment, and residences. Some of the utilities active in Iowa have offered such financing
mechanisms in other states and for specific market segments in Iowa. At least one Iowa utility
has a pilot program for a no-interest revolving loan fund. The goal of the option is to reduce
consumption of electricity, natural gas, and heating fuels across all end-user categories by 2% of
retail sales annually. End users include public-sector, industrial, commercial, multifamily
residential, and residential users. Note that the GHG reductions and costs of or benefits from
natural gas and heating fuels are not quantified in the summary table for this option.

3-9

EEC-4.

Improved Building Codes for Energy Efficiency

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents the option of setting a goal for reducing building
energy consumption, to be achieved by increasing standards for the minimum performance of
new and substantially renovated commercial and residential buildings through the adoption and
enforcement of building codes. Building codes would be made more stringent via incorporation
of aspects of advanced/next generation building designs and construction standards, such as
sustainable design and green building standards. Building codes should promote further
reduction of GHG emissions through adoption of sustainable design or green building standards.
Buildings are significant consumers of energy and other resources. Adoption and enforcement of
building energy and related codes can be an effective way to eliminate the least efficient energy
approaches in new or renovated buildings. The goal of this option is to reduce energy
consumption per square foot of floor space at newly constructed and renovated buildings by 15%
by 2012 and 50% by 2025. The new codes become effective initially in 2010, and the final goal
is achieved by 2025.
This policy also included undertaking a comprehensive review of existing state and local
building codes in Iowa to determine where increased energy efficiency can be achieved. This
review will be undertaken by the new Commission on Energy Efficiency Standards and
Practices, established by legislation enacted this year. Second, the policy aims for increasing the
stringency of the Iowa Energy Code and developing a training and certification program for code
officials, builders, and contractors on energy efficiency and related sustainable design standards,
and in code enforcement.
EEC-5.

Incentives for Energy Efficiency

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presesnts the option of changing the incentive structures in
Iowa to deploy energy efficiency. The goal of this policy is to reduce consumption by 15% of
retail sales by 2020. Energy efficiency plans in Iowa address both electric and natural gas use
through a variety of programs. New incentive approaches are of three types:
Potential Type 1 Incentives to IOUs
• Decouple IOU revenues from sales of electricity or natural gas.
•

Allow IOUs to rate-base their energy efficiency expenditures and earn returns on these
investments.

•

Allow IOUs to recover revenues that decrease due to DSM, net of utility system cost savings.

•

Allow IOUs to implement a revenue normalization mechanism to recognize the impacts of
declining per-customer sales due to DSM and other causes, while also recognizing additional
sales due to customer growth.

•

Allow IOUs to offer all DSM programs as shared-savings or Pay-As-You-Go loan programs,
with the interest or earnings on these loans retained as earnings by the IOUs.

•

Offer the IOUs some form of monetary reward based on amounts of capacity and energy
saved, recoverable from customers as part of DSM costs.
3-10

•

Evaluate alternative rate regulation structures to better align utility interests with energy
efficiency goals. For example, MidAmerican’s revenue sharing mechanism incorporates an
element of reward for energy efficiency because energy efficiency contributes to the utility’s
ability to sell electricity in the wholesale market and generate additional revenues that are,
pursuant to the revenue sharing arrangement, allocated between the utility and its customers.
Thus, the utility and its customers are rewarded for energy efficiency.

•

Allow IOUs to “own” all or part of the “carbon credit” impact of capacity and energy saved
by DSM programs, and to retain as earnings any funds received from sale of credits based on
these savings, above a certain level.

•

Require IOUs to document performance, and penalize IOUs that do not meet specific goals
by certain dates, to the extent that there is inadequacy in the current Iowa statutes and rules
requiring program documentation, and allow the IUB to conduct prudence reviews and
impose penalties.

Potential Type 2 Incentives to Utility Customers
• Rate discounts or payments to participants in load management programs, for savings of peak
load electric kilowatt (kW).
•

Time-of-use rates to electric customers, which offer lower rates off peak and much higher
rates during peak electric use periods.

•

Free energy audits and simple on-site energy efficiency measures installed during audits.

•

Advanced energy efficiency evaluation and design services, typically for nonresidential
customers.

•

Assistance to residential homebuilders in the form of training, inspection of homes, cash
payments for meeting standards, and certification/recognition of highly efficiency homes.

•

Rebates and loans to customers for purchasing energy-efficient appliances and equipment.

•

Customer education and training on energy-efficient appliances and measures (insulation,
infiltration, building weatherization measures, HVAC sizing and maintenance, etc.).

Type 3 Incentives, to Other Energy Efficiency Stakeholders
Another solution to the assumption that Iowa IOUs will not improve their DSM performance
very much beyond current levels of energy and capacity savings is to transfer the administration
of energy efficiency programs to an independent, third-party administrator. The administrator
would be subject to a performance-based compensation structure, including incentives for
superior performance.
Another means of overcoming the utilities’ disincentive to aggressively promote DSM programs
and achieve energy efficiency results is to replace the current system of utility-administered
incentives with a system that provides incentives directly to retailers of energy-efficient products
and services, energy-efficient product lenders, and building contractors/designers. Some utilities
currently offer these stakeholders incentives to promote energy-efficient products, including
training, free publicity, and per-item restocking payments to dealers and sales people for
promotion of energy-efficient appliances and equipment. Similarly, incentives could be paid
3-11

directly to marketing firms to advertise and educate consumers about energy-efficient products
and energy efficiency services.
EEC-6.

Promotion of and Incentives for Improved Design and
Construction in the Private Sector

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents this option, which provides incentives and targets
to induce the owners and developers of new and reused (major retrofitted) residential and
commercial buildings to improve the buildings' efficiency for using energy and other resources,
along with provisions for raising targets periodically and providing resources to building industry
professionals to help achieve the desired building performance. This policy can include elements
to encourage the improvement and review of energy use goals over time, and to encourage
flexibility in contracting arrangements to encourage integrated energy- and resource-efficient
design and construction. The goal of the policy is to reduce energy consumption by the
equivalent of 10% of retail electric sales and natural gas in residential and commercial buildings
beginning January 1, 2010.
EEC-7.

Training and Education for Builders and Contractors

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents the option of an education and outreach policy for
building professionals and code enforcement officials to encourage incorporation of energy
efficiency and GHG emission reduction measures into construction. These programs can train
designers, architects, builders, contractors, and code officials on a variety of relevant energy
efficiency issues, such as building shell design, insulation, and proper heating and air
conditioning sizing and installation, and can be supported by licensing requirements for design
and building trade professionals that address knowledge of techniques for reducing energy use
and sustainable design. The policy is to be in place by 2010.
EEC-8.

Technology Improvements in Targeted Markets

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents an option incorporating energy efficiency programs,
funds, or goals (such as improved weatherization and appliances/HVAC) that focus on specific
market segments at rental properties and low-income residential units. Low-income customers
typically have less energy-efficient equipment due to informational barriers and a lack of access
to capital. Also, there is a split incentive in rental markets where the tenant pays the energy bills,
so the owner has no incentive to install energy-efficient technologies. Specific approaches that
the policy could take include:
•

Expand Iowa’s Weatherization Assistance Program to make the homes of low-income
Iowans more energy efficient.

•

Develop minimum efficiency goals for rental properties, such as use of compact fluorescent
light bulbs and energy-efficient appliances. Evaluate each unit with the departure of current
tenants via a pre-rental inspection program before a new tenant takes possession.

3-12

•

Provide financial mechanisms to assist with the retrofitting of rental properties with energyefficient appliances, insulation, and high-efficiency furnaces.

•

Establish a shared savings or zero-interest loan program to make energy-efficient appliances
affordable for everyone.

•

Design policies that allow paying for energy-efficient appliances over time on residential
utility bills.

Targeting specific market segments can also be an effective component of a regional market
transformation alliance.
EEC-9.

Midwestern Governors Association Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Platform

By a majority vote, the ICCAC presents the option that Iowa participate in the development and
implementation of the Midwestern Governors Association Energy Security and Climate
Stewardship Platform, signed in November 2007 by Governor Culver. 6 This policy is designed
to address the energy efficiency goal of meeting at least 2% of the region’s annual retail sales of
natural gas and electricity through energy efficiency programs by 2015 and annually thereafter.
This policy option will require all of Iowa’s utilities—investor owned, municipal, and
cooperatives—to save at least 2% of their annual retail sales of natural gas and electricity
through energy efficiency programs by 2015.
EEC-10.

Energy Management Training/Building Operators

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents as an option the training of building energy
managers and operators. In many facilities, utility bills can be significantly decreased through
more efficient equipment and building operation. Administrative and technical training can
inform and encourage energy managers, school officials, building operators, and others
responsible for facility energy efficiency to utilize methods for minimizing unnecessary energy
waste. This policy would increase education and demonstrate the benefits of energy-efficient
building operation through government “leading by example” of energy service contracting. The
goal of the policy is to require energy managers and facility operators in all sectors to obtain
certification for successful completion of the training program starting in 2010.
EEC-11.

Rate Structures and Technologies To Promote Reductions

Passed by a unanimous vote, this policy option affects various elements of utility rate design that
are geared toward reducing GHG emissions, often with other benefits as well, such as reducing
peak power demand. The overall goal is to present rate structures so as to better reflect the actual
economic and environmental costs of producing and delivering electricity, as those costs vary by
time of day, by day of the week, by season of the year, and from year to year. In this way, rates

provide consumers with information reflecting the impacts of their consumption choices. The
goal of the policy is to reduce electricity consumption through pricing by 2% of retail sales, with
compliance beginning on January 1, 2010. Options for implementation include seasonal rates,
time-of-day rates, critical peak pricing, and real-time pricing of electricity.
EEC-12.

Demand-Side Management (DSM)/ Energy Efficiency Programs for Electricity

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents as and option a DSM/energy efficiency policy to
invest in energy efficiency equal to 1.0% of retail electricity sales per year by 2013, 1.5% per
year by 2015, and 2.0% per year by 2017. DSM/energy efficiency is a policy approach that
requires actions that influence both the quantity and the patterns of energy consumed by end
users. This policy option focuses on DSM/energy efficiency programs run by electric utilities,
and may be designed to work in tandem with other recommended strategies that can also
encourage efficiency gains. The DSM obligations and goals apply to all electric utilities in Iowa.
IOUs are starting at 0.8% of retail sales; municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives start at
varying levels.
EEC-13.

Government Lead by Example: Improved Design, Construction, and Energy Operations
in New and Existing State and Local Government Buildings

By a majority vote, the ICCAC presents an option that the state of Iowa and municipal and
county governments and school districts provide leadership in energy efficiency by adopting
policies that improve the energy efficiency of new and renovated public buildings, and the
equipment and appliances used therein. This policy option provides targets to improve the
efficiency of energy use in new and existing state and local government buildings that are much
higher than code standards. The goals for the policy are as follows:
•

Require that all new construction and major renovations of government-owned buildings,
including schools and publicly owned hospitals, meet sustainable design standards.

•

Starting in 2008, all new state buildings and major renovations will be designed to meet a
fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% of the regional
average for that building type.

•

All state and local governments will require the procurement of energy-efficient equipment,
including lighting, office equipment, and other appliances, such as ENERGY STAR. (This goal
element is quantified under EEC-14.)

•

The fossil fuel reduction standard for all new buildings will be increased to:
○
○
○
○
○

60% in 2010
70% in 2015
80% in 2020
90% in 2025
All state buildings will be carbon neutral in 2030 (zero net energy, using no fossil fuel
GHG-emitting energy to operate).

3-14

Implementing parties include state and local governments, the Capitol Planning organization, all
three Regents institutions, Iowa Association of Counties, League of Cities, Iowa Association of
School Boards, Iowa State Education Association, School Administrators of Iowa, private
contractors, and the Iowa State Building & Construction Trades Council.
EEC-14.

More Stringent Appliance Efficiency Standards

By a supermajority vote, the ICCAC presents an option increasing the efficiency of appliances in
the state. Appliance standards reduce the market cost of energy efficiency improvements by
incorporating technological advances into base appliance models, thereby creating economies of
scale. Appliance efficiency standards can be implemented at the state level for appliances not
covered by federal standards, or standards can be jointly developed by multiple states. The goal
of the policy is to achieve 5% reduction in energy consumption from residential, commercial,
and industrial consumers via:
•

80% minimum efficiency standards by 2010 for appliances not covered by federal standards;

•

100% market penetration of ENERGY STAR appliances in purchase transactions in which state
funds are involved (state purchasing contracts, state grants or loans, etc.) by 2012; and

•

A doubling of market penetration of ENERGY STAR appliances in purchases made in the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, where applicable, up to 100% by 2017.

Chapter 4
Clean and Renewable Energy
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The energy supply (ES) sector is by far the largest contributor to Iowa’s greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions. The 2005 emissions associated with Iowa electricity consumption are estimated at 37.6
million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e), which is nearly double the nextlargest sector of residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) fuel use. Iowa’s GHG emissions
from the ES sector are due to the state’s reliance on coal as a source of electricity generation.
Emissions from the sector are expected to grow by approximately 10 MMtCO2e through 2025 as
demand for electricity increases. This represents approximately 35% of the projected increase in
statewide GHG emissions over the period. Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC)
stakeholders in the Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE) Subcommittee submitted electricity load
growth forecasts that average 1.9% over the 2005–2025 period. However, GHG emissions grow
by only 1% per year due to increases in electricity generation from wind resources.
Iowa is expected to be a large importer of electricity in the later years of planning period under
the reference case. Figure 4-1 shows the breakdown of GHG emissions on a consumption basis
through 2025 by fuel type. Sectoral emissions on a production accounting basis are lower in
2025 than in the reference case (41.8 MMtCO2e), due to the imported power that is excluded
from this inventory method. However, under the two sensitivity cases forecasted, energy
production 2025 emissions are estimated at 45.44 MMtCO2e for the Sutherland scenario, and
50.09 MMtCO2e for the Elk Run scenario (not shown).

Key Challenges and Opportunities
There are significant opportunities to reduce GHG emissions growth associated with energy
production and supply in Iowa, such as promoting distributed renewable generation, combined
heat and power applications, investing in technology research and development (R&D) in the
state, and diminishing the carbon intensity of electrical generation through greater use of
renewable energy and nuclear power. There are also significant opportunities to reduce GHG
emissions through policies addressing electricity consumption, and these can often provide cost
savings as well as GHG mitigation benefits. In Chapter 3, Energy Efficiency and Conservation
(EEC), interested readers can find the 14 policy options that the ICCAC has presented for the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors to improve the efficiency of electricity
consumption.
The ICCAC is presenting several policies to increase the efficiency of electricity generation
within the ES sector. These include expanding combined heat and power (CHP) production for
commercial, industrial, and biofuels processors (CRE-12) and distributed generation (CRE-11),
which includes some small CHP applications.
Iowa has some of the largest renewable energy resource supplies in the country in the form of
wind and biomass energy. The ICCAC presents options for promoting the development of these
resources through a number of policies designed to address the various barriers to realizing the
potential for renewable resources. Implementation of renewable resources can be encouraged
through feed-in tariffs; direct financial support for biomass and other resources; renewable
electricity targets; and performance standards that reduce the CO2 intensity of generation
resources over time. Smaller, distributed resources can be specifically targeted through actions to
reduce financial, permitting, and interconnection barriers. Technology R&D can encourage
market acceptance of a variety of technologies by lowering the cost or improving the
performance of renewable generation, and by encouraging collaboration between R&D,
government, academic, and commercial sectors. R&D activities also produce employment and
economic development benefits in the state.

Overview of Policy Options and Estimated Impacts
The ICCAC presents a set of 13 policies for the ES sector that offer the potential for significant
GHG emission reductions in Iowa. Eight of these have been quantified to estimate the potential
for avoided GHG emissions. Figure 4-2 shows the percentage of potential GHG reductions from
five CRE policy options with reductions that don’t overlap with other options. If implemented
together, the quantified policy options could lead to:
•
•

Emission reductions of 48 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) per
year by 2020, and 233 MMtCO2e cumulative savings from 2008 through 2020.
Net costs of almost $6.0 billion through 2020 on a net present value basis.1 The weightedaverage cost of these policies is approximately $25/MMtCO2e.

1
The net cost savings, shown in constant 2005 dollars, are based on fuel expenditures; operations, maintenance, and
administrative costs; and amortized, incremental equipment costs. All net present value analyses here use a 5% real
discount rate.

4-2

•

The rate impacts of the policy options vary depending on the scale of the policy. A few of
the options have negligible or modest potential impacts on ratepayers. Others, like CRE-2,
which incentivizes the development of the majority of the estimated renewable electricity
supplies in the state, could raise generation costs by up to $26 per megawatt hour (MWh).
However, given that 50% of retail electricity sales could come from renewables sources
under this policy, it is likely that the electricity generated by this type of policy would be sold
to parties outside the state which could instead be a source of revenue to Iowa.

Six of these policies were approved unanimously by the ICCAC, five with a super majority, and
two with majority support. Table 4-1 shows the GHG reductions, costs, and levels of support for
the 13 policy options.
One of the options increases the human capital component of energy production and
consumption by enhancing education about the effects of climate change and giving workers the
skills necessary for a green-collar economy. Many of the options focus on economic incentives
to make clean sources of electricity competitive with more carbon intensive sources (CRE-2,
CRE-8, CRE-11, CRE-12, CRE-13). Other options require producers to deploy more climatefriendly generation resources (CRE-5). One option levies a fee based on the carbon content of
generation in order to fund energy efficiency and renewable sources of energy (CRE-4). The
most complex option (CRE-3) links Iowa’s GHG reductions efforts with the cap and trade
program being developed by the Midwestern Governors Association (MGA). Getting clean
electricity to the end user is a challenge, given the status of existing transmission and distribution
(T&D) assets and that renewable resources are often sited far from demand centers. This is an
issue even for the wind resources that are assumed to be built in the reference case for the Iowa
Inventory and Forecast. CRE-9 incentivizes upgrading of the T&D system in order to get clean
energy to the market. Two of the options incentivize the production of electricity at the point of
the end user (CRE-11, CRE-12).
The totals reported at the bottom of Table 4-1 take into account overlaps in the expected
emissions reductions and costs among some of the policies within the ES sector, as well as
between policies in the ES, RCI, and agricultural, forestry, and waste management (AFW)
sectors. Care was taken in the determination of benefits from each of the sectors to ensure that
the combined calculated impact of the policies would not double count benefits that overlap.
CRE-2 (Renewable Technologies Initiative)—This option encompasses the estimated supply
curve for renewable electricity through 2020. It is likely that the electricity generated by the new
renewable energy sources that are developed pursuant to CRE-2 will be purchased by the large
power producers that are required to comply with the clean energy targets of CRE-5. Therefore,
the reductions of CRE-5 are subtracted from CRE-2.
CRE-8 (Renewables Targets)—The renewables targets under this option are similar, but less
aggressive than what is forecasted to occur under CRE-5. Similar generation mixes are expected
under either approach. The reductions from this option are eliminated through the overlap
analysis.
CRE-13 (Pricing Strategies)—This option promotes the use of net metering and feed-in tariffs to
deploy clean energy technologies at the point of customer use. For renewables, there is very little
overlap with other CRE policy options because the other options promote the deployment of

4-3

large-scale renewable energy projects, like wind farms and co-firing biomass in pulverized coal
boilers, while this option sites small-scale renewables. However, the CHP element of this option
could overlap with CRE-12 (Combined Heat and Power) for industrial or commercial customers
who might site microturbines or other CHP technologies at the point of use. For this reason, the
electricity generation and associated carbon dioxide (CO2) reductions from this option are
reduced by 50%.
CRE policy options also overlap with other sectors. CRE-4 (Decarbonization Fund) levies a fee
based on the greenhouse gas emissions from electric generation to transition to a new, nonemitting and low emitting sources of electricity by funding specified activities such as low
income weatherization, energy efficiency, research and development and renewable sources of
energy . The renewables and energy efficiency deployment from this option are assumed to
overlap with other CRE and EEC options.
CRE-2 also overlaps with policy options AFW-3 and AFW-9. The reductions from the AFW
sectors are assumed to completely overlap with CRE-2, and are subsumed under the CRE option.
The electricity energy efficiency investments from the suite of EEC policy options reduce
electricity demand and thus make it possible to meet renewable energy mandates more costeffectively. For example, under EEC-12, electricity demand in 2020 is reduced by almost 5,000
gigawatt-hours (GWh) versus the reference case. CRE-8b assumes a 20% renewables target by
2020, which is 4% more renewable energy sources (as a percentage of retail sales) than is
forecasted under the reference case. Therefore, the implementation of EEC-12 would require 200
GWh fewer of renewable resources to meet the renewables target. Using the renewable energy
cost assumptions for CRE-8b, the reduced spending on renewables that cost more than reference
case generation in 2020 would result in savings of $0.3 million in that year.
Finally, an additional feedback is that certain CRE policies will have the effect of reducing the
GHG emissions associated with energy production, so that EEC policies that target electricity
use will have a reduced impact on overall emissions. However, this impact is small and has not
been reflected in the analysis beyond the avoided CO2 methodology that assumes in the later
years of the program that 21% new renewables are avoided by implementing the EEC options.
(The CRE methodology does not include avoided renewables, because doing so would contradict
the goals of the CRE options.) See Annex A in the CRE Appendix for a discussion of the
avoided CO2 methodology.

The options offered here present a balanced portfolio of policies to significantly reduce GHG
emissions associated with electricity supply in Iowa. Iowa’s considerable natural endowments of
wind and biomass resources, coupled with its low population density, positions Iowa as a leader
in the region and the nation to deploy clean energy. The state can benefit from developing and
selling these resources to trading partners who don’t have Iowa’s resources or have moved more
slowly. For Iowa to capture these economic advantages, the suite of policy options offered here
needs to be authorized and implemented in a timely, consistent, and thorough manner.

Clean and Renewable Energy Policy Descriptions

CRE-1.

Education

By unanimous approval, the ICCAC presents a policy option directed at education and outreach
for the purposes of nurturing public consciousness of climate change issues, as well as providing
technical skills training for employment in positions that directly support GHG emission
reduction activities. Broad awareness engages citizens of all ages to take direct action to reduce
GHG emissions through personal and public means. It also builds grass-root support for
government, industrial, and civil society actions with regard to GHG emission reduction
programs, policies, or goals. Technical instruction and training of citizens will provide the
number of skilled employees needed to fill critical jobs in the new and growing industries that
will provide emission reductions and clean energy.
Beginning in the 2010 academic year, the goals of this policy option focus on developing,
implementing, and executing a statewide climate change control awareness education and jobtraining program that: provides a platform that, along with imparting knowledge; encourages a
bias for action on the part of all Iowans; provides a specified environmental education
curriculum to primary, secondary, and post-secondary audiences within the state; provides
continuous public exposure through a variety of communications channels to educate and
enhance the awareness of Iowans about environmental issues; provides technical job training in
support of the growing need by Iowa’s renewable energy industries for skilled workers; and
develops statewide environmental literacy. The policy is implemented by elementary and
secondary school districts, municipal governments, the three Regents state universities, Iowa
community colleges, and community partners/associations.
CRE-2.

Technology Initiatives, Including Renewables

By a majority approval, the ICCAC presents a policy option that deals with the implementation
of CRE technologies that are currently commercially available. Iowa can undertake initiatives
focused on developing, promoting, and/or implementing one or more specific technologies that
show promise for reducing GHG emissions. This policy would support providing state
government and other private and public parties with resources and incentives for analysis,
targeted R&D, market development, and adoption of GHG-reducing technologies that are not
covered by other CRE policies.
CRE-2 has specific goals for annual increases of renewable electric production in Iowa subject to
maximum feasible supply constraints: landfill gas-to-energy projects—9,000 megawatt-hours
(MWh), municipal waste—65,500 MWh, wind energy—2.6 million MWh, biomass cofiring of
agricultural residues—3,600 MWh, biomass from energy crops—760,000 MWh, and repowering
hydropower facilities—112,000 MWh.

4-8

CRE-3.

Midwest Governors Cap and Trade, Including Offsets To Promote Renewables

By a majority vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option for Iowa’s participation in the Midwest
Governors Cap and Trade program. A cap-and-trade system is a constructed market-based
compliance mechanism in which GHG emissions are limited to a specified amount (i.e., the cap),
and entities subject to the cap can buy and sell (i.e., trade) emission allowances. In theory, a
properly designed cap-and-trade system of sufficient market size can lower the cost of
compliance of meeting the emissions cap to all entities involved. This is possible because
participants with a lower cost of compliance can reduce emissions below their allocation and sell
their additional allowances to a participant with a cost of compliance that is otherwise higher
than the market allowance price. The goals of this policy are assumed to be those adopted by the
MGA cap-and-trade program. The ICCAC should revisit what action to take on this option
once the MGA cap levels and model rule have been developed. The policy would start in concert
with other MGA actions. The larger the scope of a cap-and-trade program, the more likely the
odds of lowering the cost of compliance for all participants. Thus, a federal cap-and-trade
program is recommended as the first choice. A regional cap-and-trade program, such as the
MGA Accord, is the second-best choice and is also the minimum size recommended for a capand-trade program. A state-level program is not likely to be a cost-effective option; therefore, it
is not recommended.
CRE-4.

Decarbonization Fund

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option for the adoption of a fee on each
ton of CO2 emissions produced by the electricity supply sector to transition to a new, nonemitting and low-emitting sources of electricity. The most important policy aspect of a
decarbonization fee is that the revenue generation potential of even a small fee, feeding into a
targeted decarbonization fund, can be significant. Given this, the monies derived from a
decarbonization fee can provide a strong incentive toward GHG emission reductions. Thus, the
most effective decarbonization fee design would include both the front-end variables (i.e., the
covered GHGs, the amount levied per ton of emissions) and the back-end variables (i.e., where
revenue is housed, how revenue is utilized). To help mitigate the potential impacts on the
economy, the decarbonization fee should be phased in and capped at a reasonable rate, allowing
for long-term planning by consumers. Therefore, as a starting point for the analysis, it is
recommended that the decarbonization fee for electric generation begin at $1/metric ton (t) of
CO2 in 2010, and increase by $1/year until a cap of $10/tCO2 is obtained in 2019. The funding in
2019 is estimated at $320 million. This funding could only be used for energy efficiency,
renewable energy development, R&D, and low-income weatherization assistance programs and
initiatives.
CRE-5.

Performance Standards

By a supermajority vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option for generation performance
standard (GPS) to be applied to the electricity supply sector. A GPS is an emissions rate hurdle
that must be met for compliance by sources supplying electricity to consumers in Iowa. A GPS
can be applied to new generation or can include the system-wide emissions rate of an entity’s

4-9

generating fleet. The ICCAC presents two GPS targets for policymakers to choose from: either
5(a) which is the less aggressive option targeting a 50% reduction in CO2 intensity per MWh
from 2005 emission levels by 2050, or the more aggressive 5(b) option targeting a 90%
reduction goal from 2005 emissions levels by 2050.

CRE-6.

Voluntary GHG Standards

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option for adopting standards to recognize
voluntary GHG reductions by entities in the state. The standard provides an incentive for
companies that are voluntarily addressing global climate change through proactive and
innovative measures, including setting targets for GHG emission reductions, implementing
innovative energy supply and demand solutions, improving waste management practices,
participating in emissions trading, and investing in carbon sequestration opportunities and
research. The goals for an Iowa voluntary GHG program include: encouraging Iowa businesses
and citizens to voluntarily begin reducing GHG emissions immediately, without waiting for
mandatory Iowa or national GHG reduction program measures; obtaining voluntary
commitments from each of Iowa’s investor-owned utilities to reduce GHG emissions by at least
6% below the baseline year 2005 emissions by 2010; and obtaining similar commitments from
25% of Iowa’s GHG-emitting private businesses. Also, the voluntary standards should provide
rate-regulated utilities assurance of cost recovery for voluntary GHG reduction measures that are
previewed and approved as prudent and reasonable by the Iowa Utilities Board.
CRE-7.

Policies Related to Nuclear Power

By a majority vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option that, if deemed necessary, would build
one new 1200-megawatt nuclear power plant in Iowa by January 1, 2020. It is currently
estimated that it would take approximately 10–12 years to design, permit, and construct a new
nuclear power plant. Therefore, steps should be taken today if Iowa chooses to employ nuclear
power as part of a balanced and diversified energy portfolio that achieves Iowa’s long-term
carbon emission reduction goals. The focus of this particular option is to determine the economic
feasibility of nuclear power in a carbon-constrained environment, and to define specific state
legislative and regulatory actions to facilitate licensing, financing, and construction of a new
nuclear power plant in Iowa. There are considerable uncertainties about the cost characteristics
of new nuclear power. The latest numbers for nuclear power, based on an average of data
prepared by Progress Energy Florida and Florida Power and Light, estimate the total levelized unit cost
of nuclear power is $100/MWh ($2006 dollars) generated.2 This is nearly double the $52/MWh used in
the quantification for CRE-7 in Iowa.

average installed capital cost of $7,091/kW, $79/kW-yr fixed O&M costs, $3.1/MWh variable O&M costs,
$15/MWh fuel costs, and a 8.5%/yr weighted-average cost of capital. See: http://www.flclimatechange.us/

Support for Grid-Based Renewable Energy and Development

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option for financial incentives to encourage
investment in renewable energy resources by businesses and individuals who sell power
commercially. The policies help overcome financial barriers and increase incentives for
renewable energy development. Institutional barriers—such as low market prices, the inability of
the market to assign values to the public benefits of renewables and the social costs of fossil fuel
technologies, high transaction costs relative to smaller project sizes, and high financing costs
because of lender unfamiliarity and perceived risk—can be overcome through a suite of financial
and regulatory incentives for renewable energy development. These policies and incentives can
include direct subsidies for buying or selling renewable generation equipment, tax credits or
exemptions for buying or selling renewable generation equipment, government-sponsored or
-facilitated loan programs for buying renewable generation equipment, tax credits, or direct
subsidies for each kilowatt-hour (kWh) generated or sold from renewable generation facilities.
This option includes two different pathways for promoting renewable energy development. CRE8a (More aggressive case) increases grid-based renewable electric production in Iowa by
400,000 MWh (400 GWh) of generation in the first year and growing by 1% of retail MWh sales
each year thereafter. This policy adds an average of 521 GWh of new renewable resources per
year over 2012–2020, and results in incremental renewables generation equal to 3.7% of retail
sales by 2015, and 8.2% of retail sales by 2020. Including assumed reference case renewables
deployment, CRE-8a results in approximately 24.2% of renewables as a percentage of retail sales
by 2020, and 32.2% by 2030. CRE-8b (Less aggressive case) reflects the MGA renewable
energy goal, which is a goal for the Midwest region equivalent to 10% of retail MWh sales by
2015, 20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030. CRE-8b results in new renewables generation equal to
4% of retail sales by 2020, and additional increments equal to 1% of retail sales each year
thereafter. Including assumed reference case renewables deployment, CRE-8b results in the
MGA target of 20% of renewables as a percentage of retail sales by 2020, and 30% by 2030.
CRE-9.

Transmission System Upgrading

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option to upgrade Iowa’s transmission
system. The policy's goals are to research how implementing modern grid technologies would
enable a more efficient and intelligent transmission system; identify specific legislative and
regulatory actions that would be needed to support long-term, cost-effective alternatives that
increase transmission system capabilities; and commission a study that would identify areas in
Iowa’s transmission system where upgrading and/or expanding transmission would enable the
state’s wind resources to be developed for Iowa users and for potential exports to other states.
CRE-10.

Research and Development (R&D) for Emerging Technologies and Corresponding
Incentives

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option for supporting R&D of emerging
technologies to develop demonstration projects and eventual commercialization of reasonablecost generation technologies with low or zero GHG emissions. Technology areas often cited as

4-11

requiring such reasonable-cost developments are CO2 capture and storage (e.g., in deep saline
aquifers or coal seams) for fossil fuel facilities, and large-scale baseload renewable energy or
technologies that can transform intermittent renewables into baseload generation (e.g., batteries,
compressed air storage). A small fee per kWh of electricity could generate significant funding
for R&D and commercialization. By 2010, the policy would begin to implement the R&D
funding mechanisms.
CRE-11.

Distributed Generation/Co-Generation

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option focusing on encouraging
investment in small-scale distributed generation (DG) through incentives or subsidies and the
prevention of barriers for both utility and consumer investment, with a goal of deploying 7500
MWh per year of new distributed renewable generation by 2010 and continuing each year
thereafter. DG can be encouraged by ensuring access to the grid under uniform technical and
contractual terms for interconnection that are based on best practices, so that owners know in
advance the requirements for parallel interconnection and manufacturers can design standard
packages to meet technical requirements. Changes that generally facilitate the integration of
customer-owned DG with the grid could encourage the adoption of specific renewable energy
and high-efficiency technologies, including solar photovoltaic systems, fuel cells, and
microturbines. Uniform requirements for emissions, land use, and building codes should be
established that are based on the technology of electricity generation, so that manufacturers can
design suitable units and owners of distributed generators are not restricted in their siting and
operating decisions relative to other new sources of generation.
CRE-12.

Combined Heat and Power (CHP)

By a unanimous vote, the ICCAC presents a policy option to promote CHP technology, which
recovers waste heat from energy production for productive use. The key to implementing CHP
systems is to provide adequate incentives for the development of infrastructure to capture and
utilize the waste heat. Such incentives could come in many forms, such as recruiting suitable end
users to the area, tax credits, grants, zoning, and offset credits for avoided emissions. Studies
indicate substantial opportunities for electricity generation at commercial and industrial facilities
in the state. In addition, Iowa’s leadership as a biofuels producer is a significant source of CHP
electricity, where the waste heat from electricity generation can be used to refine biofuel
feedstocks.
CRE-13.

Pricing Strategies To Promote Renewable Energy and/or CHP

By a super majority vote, the ICCAC offers this policy option focusing on creating pricing and
metering strategies that can encourage consumers to implement CHP, renewable energy, and
overall reductions in GHG emissions. Pricing strategies, such as feed-in tariffs, provide
minimum utility purchase rates for DG. Net metering is a policy that allows owners of DG
(generating units on the customer side of the meter, often limited to some maximum kW level) to
generate excess electricity and effectively sell it back to the utility by “turning the meter
backward.” Implementation of pricing strategies, such as feed-in tariffs, must be considered in

4-12

light of existing rules, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s avoided cost
standard. The goal of this option is to achieve a 10% shift to renewable energy sources, as a
percentage of retail sales, through implementation of various pricing strategies. The policy
begins with a 1% shift achieved in 2010, and continues with linear growth through 2019.

Transportation and Land Use Sectors
Overview of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The transportation sector, which includes light- and heavy-duty (on-road) vehicles, aircraft, rail
engines, and marine engines, is one of the largest contributors of gross greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions in Iowa. This sector accounted for 17% of Iowa’s gross GHG emissions in 2005,
which was slightly under the national average of 27%. However, by 2025, the share of emissions
associated with the transportation sector is anticipated to increase slightly to 20%.
From 1990 to 2005, Iowa’s GHG emissions from transportation fuel use have risen steadily at an
average rate of about 1.4% annually. The GHG emissions associated with Iowa’s transportation
sector also rose accordingly, increasing by 3.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent
(MMtCO2e) emissions during the same time period from about 17 MMtCO2e to nearly 21
MMtCO2e. If left unabated, this number is expected to increase by nearly 30%, to 29.4
MMtCO2e by 2025.
Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for about 98% of transportation GHG emissions, with most of
the remaining GHG emissions coming from nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from gasoline
engines. Emissions released from on-road gasoline consumption account for approximately 57%
of the transportation sector's GHG emissions. This has historically been the largest share of
transportation GHG emissions, and this trend is forecast to continue.
Figure 5-1 shows historic and projected transportation GHG emissions by fuel and source. As a
result of Iowa’s population and economic growth and an increase in total vehicle miles traveled
(VMT), GHG emissions from on-road gasoline consumption increased by about 14% between
1990 and 2005 and accounted for 63% of the total transportation emissions in 2005. Meanwhile,
GHG emissions from on-road diesel fuel consumption rose by 44% during that period,
accounting for 28% of GHG emissions from the transportation sector in 2005, suggesting an
even more rapid growth in freight movement within or across the state.
In the absence of significant increases in vehicle fuel economy, a significant reduction in VMT,
or technological breakthroughs in low-carbon fuels, on-road gasoline and diesel emissions are
expected to continue to grow. GHG emissions from on-road gasoline consumption are projected
to increase by about 33%, and GHG emissions from on-road diesel consumption are expected to
increase by 75% between 2005 and 2025. The consumption of these fuels will significantly
contribute to the projected 42% increase in overall GHG emission levels for the entire state of
Iowa over 2005 levels by 2025.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Iowa has substantial opportunities to reduce transportation emissions. The principal means to
reduce emissions from transportation and land use (TLU) are:
•

Improving vehicle fuel efficiency,

•

Substituting gasoline and diesel with lower-emission fuels, and

•

Reducing total VMT.

In Iowa and in the nation as a whole, vehicle fuel efficiency has improved little since the late
1980s, yet many studies have documented the potential for substantial increases in efficiency,
while maintaining vehicle size and performance. Automobile manufacturers typically oppose
dramatic increases in fuel economy. Key points of contention include the cost to manufacturers
and cost to consumers. Even with the adoption of the new federal corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) requirements, there may still be opportunities for further increases in fuel
efficiency while maintaining vehicle size and performance.
The use of fuels with lower per-mile GHG emissions is growing in Iowa, and larger market
penetration is possible. Conventional gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles can use low-level
blends of biofuels. Alternative-technology vehicles can also use higher-level blends of biofuels,
as well as other types of alternative fuels, such as natural gas and hydrogen. The type of fuel
used is a crucial determinant of impact on emissions, as some alternative fuels have relatively
little GHG benefit. Currently, the most prevalent biofuel in Iowa is corn-based ethanol, which

5-2

has a GHG benefit of 15.9% from a life-cycle perspective.1 Key determinants of impact will be
the development and deployment of fuel types. At present, fuel distribution infrastructure is a
constraining factor.
Reducing VMT is crucial to mitigating GHG emissions from transportation. Developing smarter
land-use and transportation development patterns that reduce trip length and support transit, ride
sharing, biking, and walking can contribute substantially to this goal. A variety of pricing polices
and incentive packages can also help to reduce VMT. Developing better planning methods and
regulations, and increasing funding of multiple modes of transportation will be key components
in achieving these goals.

Overview of Policy Options and Estimated Impacts
The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) selected a set of 11 policies for the TLU
sector that offer the potential for major economic benefits and emission savings. Implementing
these policy options could lead to emission reductions of:
•

11.14 MMtCO2e per year by 2020, and

•

55.03 MMtCO2e cumulative from 2009 through 2020.

The weighted-average cost effectiveness of the selected policies is about -$59/tCO2e. This
average value includes policies that have both much lower and much higher likely costs per ton.
One option, the cost of which particularly skews the numbers, is TLU-4, “Support Passenger
Rail Service in Iowa.” This policy option has an identified cost per ton of $597/tCO2e which is
largely driven by high up-front capital costs associated with the development of new rail lines. It
should be noted that by 2024 the cumulative ridership benefits are anticipated to outstrip these
costs and this policy option will have a negative cost per ton beyond 2024.
The estimated impacts of the individual policy options are shown in Table 5-1. The ICCAC
policy options are described briefly here and in more detail in Appendix H of this report. The
options not only result in significant emission reductions, but offer a host of additional benefits
as well. These benefits include reduced local air pollution; more livable, healthier communities;
and economic development and job growth from the development of transit and rail, smart
growth developments, and in-state biofuel production. To yield the levels of savings described
here, these policies need to be implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner.
Some policy options focus on reducing VMT by further developing other modes of
transportation, such as transit (TLU-1a) and passenger rail (TLU-4). Other VMT reduction
strategies include implementing programs to eliminate or make commuting more efficient by
improving pedestrian, bicycling, and carpooling options or placing work centers within
established communities (TLU-5a, TLU-5b). Further rail development and implementing new
freight strategies can also significantly reduce VMT associated with freight transportation (TLU9). Another way to reduce VMT is to develop denser, mixed-use communities where the need
1

Biofuels analysis was based on information from the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model, version 1.8,
which indicates a life-cycle emission reduction of 15.9% for E85 corn ethanol. See Appendix H for more details on
assumed reduction factors for various types of biofuels.

5-3

for long commutes becomes significantly reduced and transit can be easily implemented (TLU1). All of the above mentioned policy options help to reduce GHG emissions by moving people
and freight more efficiently and providing other options for people and freight to reach their
destinations.
Qualitative policies (policy options that are nonquantifiable) are an important component of the
combined policies, but because they are not quantified, these options are not reflected in the
GHG emission reductions or costs. These options focus on establishing a reliable source of
capital funding for transportation related GHG reduction policies (TLU-2) and developing a
distributed workplace model where smaller work centers are located in communities, thereby
reducing VMT (TLU-5b). While the implementation of these options may contribute to
significant GHG emission reductions, the immediate impact of these policies individually is not
quantifiable.
Further developing the efficiency of vehicles can also have a major impact on reducing GHG
emissions. TLU-6 focuses on providing incentives such as feebates, tax credits for low GHG
vehicles, and operating incentives for low GHG vehicles to promote the purchase and operation
of more efficient vehicles. Increased utilization of these low GHG emission vehicles can
significantly impact overall GHG emissions associated with light-duty vehicle VMT. Working
in concert with TLU-6, TLU-8 promotes the development of fuel efficient vehicles by promoting
increased fuel economy standards through the adoption of a State Clear Car Program. TLU-7
aims at increasing vehicle efficiency by impacting consumer choice through educating
consumers about vehicle maintenance and operation techniques and encouraging the use of fuel
efficient tires.
Iowa can achieve greater alternative fuel use while simultaneously reducing GHG emissions by
putting in place a low-carbon fuel standard (TLU-10). Such a policy option ensures that fuel
sold in Iowa would meet, on average, a declining standard for GHG emissions measured in CO2
equivalent per unit of fuel energy.

development, taken together, in terms of avoided GHG emissions. For the TLU policies
developed by the ICCAC to yield the levels of savings described here, the policies must be
implemented in a timely, aggressive, and thorough manner. This means, for example, not only
putting the policies themselves in place, but also attending to the development of supporting
policies that are needed to help make these TLU policies effective. While their adoption can
result in considerable benefits to Iowa’s environment and consumers, careful, comprehensive,
and detailed planning and implementation, as well as consistent support of these policies will be
required if these benefits are to be achieved.

Policy Descriptions

The policy options described briefly here not only result in significant emission reductions but
also offer a host of additional benefits, such as reduced local air pollution; more livable, healthier
communities; and increased transportation choices. A more thorough description of these policy
options along with their goals, implementation strategies, and other details is available in
Appendix H.
TLU-1.

Smart Growth Bundle with Transit

This policy option calls for incentives and programs to encourage smart growth, including
downtown revitalization, transit-oriented development, and enhancing the pedestrian and bicycle
infrastructure, thereby reducing VMT. Current land-use development practices increase vehicle
travel by dispersing destinations, which separates activities and favors automobile travel over
alternative modes. "Smart growth" planning by local, regional, and state governments refers to
development that reduces sprawl and maximizes environmental, fiscal, and economic resources.
Under this policy option, Iowa would encourage, facilitate, and undertake a set of smart growth
activities related to the following initiatives: downtown revitalization including infill and
brownfield redevelopment, transit-oriented development, smart growth planning, the
development of pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, growth management planning, and the
reformation of local zoning, tax, and building codes. Additionally, this policy option would
provide both technical and financial support to local and regional agencies.
TLU-1a.

Expand & Improve Transit Infrastructure

The goal of this policy option is to achieve an annual ridership increase of 100% by the year
2020, to be measured on a per capita basis. This will be achieved by making improvements to
existing transit service, such as increasing service frequency, offering more forms of transit,
improving the quality of service, promoting ridesharing activities, and reducing travel times on
selected transit routes. Additionally fare reductions, employer subsidies, and state incentives may
all be offered to assist in increasing ridership. This policy option will shift passenger
transportation from single-occupant vehicles to public transit, thereby reducing GHG emissions.
Additional funding will be provided by increasing state financing to at least 25% for transit
systems across the state with increasing ridership or the ability to document VMT-reducing
strategies. State legislation will also be proposed to enable new transportation-related fees,
generated solely by users in a regional area, to be allocated directly to RTAs for VMT-reducing
services.

5-7

TLU-2.

GHG Impacts for State and Local Capital Funding (to be a model for climate-friendly
development patterns)

The focus of this policy option is to ensure that state and local capital funding programs for the
development, siting, and expansion of state facilities as well as funding used for community
development, is utilized to promote policies and facilities that support GHG emission reductions.
This includes making state and local government buildings location-efficient with compact
development design, and ensuring that capital funding for infrastructure and funding for
community development goes towards policies and development that promotes GHG reductions.
Programs such as “complete streets”, smart growth development, and the development or
enhancement of transit are all identified as projects that support GHG emission reductions and
for which funding associated with this policy option could be dedicated.
TLU-4.

Support Passenger Rail Service In Iowa

This policy option will focus on reducing single occupant vehicle travel by establishing and
promoting a statewide passenger rail system in Iowa to supplement existing long-distance
service. This rail system will include regional rail service from Dubuque to Chicago and
between Omaha and Chicago with stops in Des Moines, Iowa City / Cedar Rapids, and the Quad
Cities. A key to the success of this statewide passenger rail system will be in providing
connections to other modes of transportation.
TLU-5a.

Adopt Best Workplaces for Commuters in Iowa

This policy option focuses on reducing the VMT associated with commuters traveling to and
from work. By making the daily commute more efficient or possibly eliminating the need for
commuting to work, this policy reduces GHG emissions by reducing VMT. Promoting strategies
such as telecommuting, carpooling, and vanpooling, and the use of alternative modes of
transportation such as transit, bicycling, and walking to work this policy can be very effective at
reducing VMT and roadway congestion during the peak commuting hours. The success of this
policy option would depend upon buy-in from employers.
TLU-5b.

Distributed Workplace Model

This policy option focuses on the commuting patterns of Iowa’s knowledge-based workforce.
The Distributed Workplace Model is a community work model that moves beyond the “work
from home” methodology of telecommuting and remotely supporting employees, and instead
provides community-based multi-location work centers that will enhance access for both
employers and employees. These work centers will accommodate a cluster of employees
working for multiple employers, thereby reducing VMT associated with the commute to work.

5-8

TLU-6.

Light-Duty Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Incentives

This policy option focuses on reducing GHG emissions within Iowa by improving the fuel
economy of the light duty vehicle fleet by providing incentives such as feebates, tax credits for
low-GHG vehicles, operating incentives for low-GHG vehicles, and vehicle registration fees
which are reduced for low-emission vehicles and increased for high-emission vehicles. The goal
of this policy would be to increase the fuel economy of the light duty vehicle fleet in Iowa by
20% by 2012, 100% by 2020, and 250% of more by 2050. This policy option would need to
pass through the legislative process and implemented by state and local government agencies in
partnership with the affected parties.
This policy option assumes no direct correlation between fuel economy and GHG emission
efficiency. Although it is likely that an increase in fuel economy will result in reduced GHG
emissions, the amount of this decrease or potential increase is dependent upon the carbon content
and energy content of the fuel.
TLU-7a.

Fuel Efficient Operations for Light-Duty Vehicles

This policy option focuses on improving the efficiency of light-duty vehicles by increasing the
utilization of simple add on devices such as fuel efficient tires, and providing education on how
to efficiently operate and maintain light duty vehicles. Maintenance tips would include items
such as keeping tires properly inflated and regularly changing oil and air filters.
TLU-8.

New Vehicle Standards for Increased Fuel Economy and Reduced Greenhouse Gas
Emissions

This policy option promotes the development of a state clean car program. This program would
go beyond the current federal CAFÉ emissions standards for cars and light trucks and would
come from the “Tier 2” state clean car standards expected to be proposed in the near future under
the federal Clean Air Act. The goals of this program would be to improve fuel economy by 20%
by 2012, 100% by 2020, and 250% or more by 2050.
TLU-9.

Freight Strategies (Truck and Rail)

This policy option proposes reducing Iowa’s overall GHG emissions generated by freight
movement through a combination of identifying actions to support efficient freight movement,
removing both physical and operational bottlenecks, encouraging railroad capital investment, and
providing incentives for trucking companies to invest in hybrid technology.
TLU-10.

Fuel Strategies: Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (20% Reduction)

This policy option seeks to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the carbon intensity of vehicles
fuels sold in Iowa. By setting a Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), all fuel providers in Iowa
would be required to ensure the mix of fuel they sell into the Iowa market meets, on average, a

5-9

declining standard for GHG emissions measured in CO2 equivalent per unit of fuel energy. This
policy option does not specify any particular fuel or vehicle technology, leaving the door open to
both current technology and future advances in the development of law-carbon fuels. The
creation in Iowa of a LCFS will compliment the Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS)
creating additional demand of Iowa’s renewable fuels across the country and increasing exports
of Iowa’s renewable fuels across the country as other states begin formalizing their own state
standards for renewable fuels and GHG controls.

5-10

Chapter 6
Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management
Overview of GHG Emissions
While the agriculture, forestry, and waste management (AFW) sectors are responsible for significant greenhouse gas
emissions, the sector is also a significant sink for greenhouse gases in soils and in forest stocks. The gross AFW

contribution to carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions in 2005 was 30 million metric tons
(MMt), or about 25% of the state’s total. However, the AFW contribution to net emissions in
2005 was only 3 MMtCO2e due to the net sequestration of carbon in the forestry and agriculture
sectors. As described in the Iowa Inventory and Forecast (I&F) report, it is important to
recognize that emissions from fossil fuel consumption within the AFW sectors are included
within the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sectors (particularly the industrial
sector).
Agricultural emissions include methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from enteric
fermentation, manure management, agricultural soils management, and agriculture residue
burning. These emissions were estimated to be about 28 MMtCO2e in 2005. As shown in Figure
6-1, emissions from soil carbon losses from agricultural soils, manure management, fertilizer
application, and crop residues all make significant contributions to the sector totals. Emissions
include CO2 emissions from oxidized soil carbon, application of urea, and application of lime.
Sector emissions also include N2O emissions resulting from activities that increase nitrogen in
the soil, including fertilizer (synthetic, organic, and livestock) application and production of
nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes).
The largest source of emissions in the agricultural sector is the agricultural soils category, whose
emissions are projected to hold steady from 1990 to 2025, accounting for 62% (15.7 MMtCO2e)
of total gross agricultural emissions in 1990 and 60% (15.3 MMtCO2e) in 2025. In 1990, enteric
fermentation accounted for about 20% (5.04 MMtCO2e) of total gross agricultural emissions.
Enteric fermentation emissions decreased slightly to 4.26 MMtCO2e between 1990 and 2005 due
to the decline in livestock populations during this period. Both the dairy cattle and beef cattle
populations are projected to decrease in the future, and enteric fermentation emissions are
estimated to decrease to 2.98 MMtCO2e in 2025, or about 12% of agricultural emissions.
The manure management category accounted for 18% (4.49 MMtCO2e) of total agricultural
emissions in 1990 and increased to 24% (6.64 MMtCO2e) by 2005. Manure management is
projected to increase slightly by 2025, to account for 27% (7.01 MMtCO2e) of total agricultural
emissions at that time. This is largely due to the projection that the swine population will
increase between 2005 and 2025.
Forestland emissions refer to the net CO2 flux1 from forested lands in Iowa, which account for
about 8% of the state’s land area.2 As shown in Table 6-1, U.S. Forest Service (USFS) data
1

“Flux” refers to both emissions of CO2 to the atmosphere and removal (sinks) of CO2 from the atmosphere.

Total forested area and forest type percentages provided by P. Tauke, Iowa Department of Natural Resources

suggest the total flux estimate including all forest pools is –12.2 MMtCO2e/yr between 1990 and
2003, and is –24.4 MMtCO2e/yr between 2003 and 2005.3 These totals include large sink
estimates for soil carbon (–4.3 and –9.2 MMtCO2/yr). The negative trend in carbon flux
(sequestration) is likely due to the increase in timberland between 1990 and 2005.

Figure 6-2 shows estimated historical and projected emissions from the management and
treatment of solid waste and wastewater. Emissions from waste management consist largely of
CH4 emitted from landfills, while emissions from wastewater treatment include both CH4 and
N2O. Emissions are also included for municipal solid waste (MSW) combustion. Figure 6-2
illustrates that emissions from MSW landfills are projected to increase significantly through
2025. Overall, the waste management sector accounts for about 2% of Iowa’s total gross
emissions per year from 1990 through 2025.

Opportunities for GHG mitigation in the AFW sector involve measures that can reduce
emissions within the sector or in other sectors. Examples of reductions that can occur within the
sector include changes in crop management practices that reduce GHG emissions by building
soil carbon (indirectly sequestering carbon from the atmosphere); more efficient nutrient
application (reducing N2O emissions—note that emissions outside of the AFW sectors are also

6-3

reduced here due to the embedded energy in nutrients and the potential for lower energy
consumption during their application); reforestation projects that achieve GHG reductions by
increasing the carbon sequestration capacity of the state’s forests; and landfill gas collection and
control, which reduces methane emissions from landfills.
For GHG reductions outside of the AFW sectors, actions taken within the sectors, such as
production of liquid biofuels, can offset emissions in the transportation sector, while biomass
energy can reduce emissions in the energy supply, residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.
Similarly, actions that promote solid waste reduction or recycling can reduce emissions within
the AFW sectors (future landfill CH4), as well as emissions associated with the production of
recycled products (recycled products often require less energy to produce than similar products
from raw materials). Finally, urban forestry projects can reduce energy consumption within
buildings through shading and wind protection.
Following are primary opportunities for GHG mitigation identified by the Iowa Climate Change
Advisory Council (ICCAC).
•

Nutrient management: Increasing the efficiency and improving the distribution of nutrient
application can reduce on-field application of nitrogen and reduce formation of N2O.
Reductions may also occur when nitrogen runoff and leaching are reduced.

•

Wetlands and drainage: Redesigning Iowa drainage systems with the consideration of
GHG benefits can result in significant GHG benefits over the longer term through reduced
nitrogen transport to water resources, which reduces N2O emissions by reducing
denitrification from wet and seasonally flooded croplands.

•

Expanded use of forest and agricultural biomass: Expanding the use of biomass energy
from residue removed from forested areas during treatments to reduce fire risk, from crop
residues and purpose-grown crops, and from livestock manure/poultry litter can achieve
GHG benefits by offsetting fossil fuel consumption (to produce either electricity or
heat/steam). Programs to expand sustainably procured biomass fuel production will most
likely be needed to supply a portion of the fuel mix for the renewable energy goals under the
Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC) and Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE)
Subcommittees.

•

Manure management and methane utilization: The capture and utilization of methane
from livestock manure can reduce GHG emissions through reduced methane emissions and
through offsetting fossil fuel-based energy production and the associated GHG emissions.
Additionally, implementing improved manure handling and storage programs, practices, and
technologies can reduce methane emissions from animal operations.

•

Land management to promote sequestration benefits: Significant opportunities exist
through the adoption of a number of different land management practices that either reduce
emissions or increase sequestration. These include increasing the use of conservation tillage
practices, converting marginal agricultural land to higher-sequestration permanent cover,
implementing conservation grazing practices, establishing afforestation programs, and
increasing urban tree coverage.

6-4

•

Cellulosic biofuels: Producing renewable fuels, such as ethanol from energy crops, crop
residue, forestry residue, or municipal solid waste can produce significant reductions when
they are used to offset consumption of fossil fuels (e.g., gasoline and diesel in the
transportation sector). This is particularly true when these fuels are produced using processes
and/or feedstocks that emit much lower GHG emissions than those from conventional
sources (e.g., corn-based ethanol).

•

Improved on-farm (or first point of purchase) energy use and efficiency: On-farm energy
efficiency and renewable energy offer emission savings and reduced costs to land owners.

•

Changes in municipal solid waste management practices: Concentrating on enhancing the
source reduction, recycling, and organics management (e.g., composting practices) in the
state can result in significant GHG emission reductions. Also, for waste remaining after full
implementation of these “front-end” practices, appropriate GHG-beneficial “end-of-life”
practices should be implemented, including enhanced landfill gas collection and utilization.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
Within the agriculture sector, the ICCAC recommends programs to promote farming practices
that achieve GHG benefits, such as conservation tillage where soil management programs
increase soil carbon levels, thereby indirectly sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. These
programs were estimated to achieve reductions of approximately 9 MMtCO2e per year by 2020
through the implantation of conservation tillage practices on 75% of annual cropland by 2020.
Additionally, initiatives to reduce methane emissions from livestock manure through improved
manure handling and storage practices and the capture and utilization of methane offer
significant potential at low or negative costs. However, the feasibility of utilizing methane and
displacing natural gas or electricity may be limited by the lack of sufficiently large dairy farms,
seasonal variability, and the limited demand by nearby industries.
ICCAC policy option AFW-3 promotes the expanded use of biomass as an energy source for
producing electricity, heat, or steam. Use of biomass to replace fossil fuels was estimated to
reduce approximately 20 MMtCO2e by 2020. The ICCAC conducted a limited assessment of the
available biomass resources in the state, which indicated that sufficient resources are available
through 2020 to achieve the goals for both the cellulosic biofuels policy option (discussed below)
and this biomass for energy option. A key challenge to the implementation of this policy is the
proximity of the feedstock to the end user.
The ICCAC found significant opportunity in promoting biofuels production using feedstocks and
production methods with superior GHG benefits (i.e., superior to conventional starch-based
ethanol), almost 10 MMtCO2e by 2020. The ICCAC noted that there may be an overlap between
the cellulosic biofuels option with agricultural options that seek to increase and maintain crop
acreage in no-till production or in conservation management programs (i.e., in relation to using
crop residue as an energy feedstock).
Within the forestry sector, afforestation, unmanaged grazed forested land, and urban forestry (all
components of AFW-5) have the potential to deliver over 1 MMtCO2e/year of GHG reductions
in 2020. By 2020, these programs call for establishing 250,000 acres of new forestlands,

6-5

improving management practices on 500,000 acres of unmanaged grazed forested land, and
increasing the canopy cover of urban forest in Iowa communities by 25%.
AFW-8 and AFW-9 provide an integrated set of policy options for future management of
municipal solid waste in Iowa. AFW-8 focuses on “front-end” waste management
technologies—source reduction, recycling, and composting—while AFW-9 focuses on “end-ofuse” waste management approaches. Source reduction and recycling will result in avoided
landfill GHG emissions, as well as avoided product/packaging life-cycle GHG emissions. The
combined front-end waste management elements produce substantial GHG savings—almost 5
MMtCO2e in 2020.

Overview of Policy Options and Estimated Impacts
As noted above, the nine policy options for the AFW sectors address a diverse array of activities.
Taken as a whole, they offer significant cost-effective emission reductions, as shown in Table 63.
Figure 6-3 shows the breakdown of the cumulative emission reductions (2009–2020) anticipated
from the recommended actions in the AFW sectors. The greatest emission reductions achieved
(31%) come from implementation of land management to promote sequestration benefits (AFW5). The majority of these reductions are associated with increasing the use of conservation tillage
practices.
The expanded use of agriculture and forestry biomass feedstocks for electricity, heat, or steam
production (AFW-3) also offers significant GHG reductions, even after accounting for overlap
with the CRE Subcommittee policies. Significant reductions are also achieved through AFW-6
cellulosic fuel incentives (16%), AFW-8 waste management strategies (11%), and AFW-4 largescale manure/methane management, capture, and utilization (9%). Emission reductions from
waste management strategies are life-cycle GHG reductions that occur both within and outside of
Iowa (resulting from lower energy use and GHG emissions to create, transport, and dispose of
new products and packaging that are avoided through source reduction and recycling). It is
important to note that AFW-3 and AFW-6 overlap with policy options under the Transportation
and Land Use (TLU) and CRE Subcommittees, respectively. After accounting for overlap, these
policies contribute a significantly smaller proportion to the AFW sector total.
Table 6-3, the summary list of policy options, and Figure 6-3, a pie chart showing the percentage
of avoided greenhouse gas emissions by policy, are on the following two pages.

Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management Sectors
Policy Descriptions

The AFW sectors include emission mitigation opportunities related to the use of biomass energy,
protection and enhancement of forest and agricultural carbon sinks, control of agricultural CH4
and N2O emissions, production of renewable liquid fuels, production of additional biomass
energy, forestation on nonforested lands, and an increase in municipal solid waste source
reduction, recycling, composting, and landfill gas collection.
AFW-1

Nutrient Management

This policy option promotes the use of improved manure management practices that reduce
GHG emissions associated with manure handling and storage, including manure composting to
reduce CH4 emissions, movement of manure from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deficient areas, and
improved methods for application to fields (for reduced N2O emissions). Application
improvements include incorporating manure into soil instead of surface spraying or spreading.
AFW-2

Wetlands and Drainage

This policy promotes the redesigning of drainage infrastructure over the next fifty years.
Designing to reduce nitrogen transport to water resources also reduces N2O emissions in Iowa
and downstream, with significant global GHG benefits over the longer term. This is due to the
function of strategically targeted and designed denitrification wetland systems and the long life
of both the wetlands and the drainage systems.
AFW-3

Expanded Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, or
Steam Production

This policy dedicates a sustainable quantity of biomass from agricultural industry residues,
agricultural lands, wood industry process residues, unused forestry residues, agroforestry
resources, and dedicated energy crops to efficient conversion to heat, steam, or electricity. This
biomass should be collected and used in an environmentally acceptable manner, considering
proper facility siting and feedstock use (e.g., proximity of users to biomass, impacts on water
supply and quality, control of air emissions, cropping management, nutrient management, soil
and nonsoil carbon management, and impacts on biodiversity and wildlife habitat). The objective
is to create concurrent reduction of GHG emissions due to displacement of fossil fuel,
considering life-cycle emissions associated with viable collection, hauling, and energy
conversion and distribution systems. Local electricity or steam production yields the greatest net
energy payoff.

6-9

Note: This option is linked with some Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE) options (e.g., CRE-24
and CRE-13). AFW-3 focuses on the supply elements of the implementation of a biomass-toenergy program (e.g., availability, collection, and distribution), while the CRE options focus on
the demand side (e.g., generation infrastructure and purchasing for consumers).
AFW-4

Encourage Large-Scale Manure/Methane Management Capture Utilization

This policy is aimed at improving manure handling and storage practices; reducing methane
emissions from livestock manure by installing large-scale anaerobic digester systems at
concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs); and utilizing methane captured from the
digesters to create heat or power, which offsets fossil fuel-based energy production and the
associated GHG emissions. This option is focused on implementing these projects on a large
scale (e.g., community-based systems or large CAFOs).
AFW-5

Land Management to Promote Sequestration Benefits

This policy option addresses a range of land management practices. On cultivated lands, the
amount of carbon stored in the soil can be increased by the adoption of such practices as
continuous conservation and no-till cultivation. By minimizing mechanical soil disturbance,
these practices reduce the oxidation of soil carbon compounds and allow more stable aggregates
to form. Converting marginal agricultural land used for annual crops to permanent cover (e.g.,
grassland/rangeland) increases the soil carbon or carbon in biomass. Rotational grazing, where
animals are regularly moved from field to field, can reduce soil disturbance, improve plant vigor,
and enhance soil carbon levels. Establishing forests on land that has not historically been
forested (e.g., afforestation of agricultural land) and maintaining and improving the health and
longevity of urban trees enhance the carbon stored in tree biomass. Indirect emission reductions
from urban forestry may also occur by reducing heating and cooling needs as a result of planting
shade trees.
AFW-6

Cellulosic Biofuels

This policy promotes sustainable in-state production of cellulosic biofuels from agriculture,
forestry, and MSW feedstocks (raw materials) to displace the use of conventional petroleumbased fuels. It also promotes advanced biofuel production systems that improve the embedded
energy content and carbon profile of biofuels. It focuses on feedstocks that favor energy
production and are carbon neutral or carbon negative and that have multiple positive
environmental benefits, such as maintaining carbon sequestration potential and soil productivity,
and decreasing water and fossil fuel inputs during their production. This could help provide a
strong economic market within the state and reduce GHG emissions through avoided fossil fuel
consumption. This option also promotes the in-state development of cellulosic material and
perennials that are able to be utilized.

4

CRE-2 incorporates or adjusts for biomass used by CRE-5 and CRE-8.

6-10

Note: This option is linked with option TLU-10. AFW-6 focuses on the supply elements of the
implementation of a biofuels program, while TLU-10 focuses on the demand side (e.g., vehicle
technology requirements, E10, E85).
AFW-7

Improved On-Farm (or First Point of Purchase) Energy Use and Efficiency

On-farm energy efficiency and renewable energy offer emission savings and reduced costs to
landowners. Renewable energy can be produced and used on site at agriculture operations (e.g.,
installing solar or wind power, using hydropowered generators for irrigation, and converting
diesel farm equipment to more efficient or renewable energy technology). The use of energyefficient products, such as improved grain dryers, heat exchangers (dairy), electric motors, and
energy-efficient building design, also offers significant potential for GHG reduction.
AFW-8

Waste Management Strategies

This policy option focuses on reducing the volume of waste from residential, commercial, and
government sectors through programs that reduce the generation of waste. Reducing generation
at the source reduces landfill emissions and upstream production emissions. Increasing recycling
or reusing waste limits GHG emissions associated with landfill methane generation and with the
production and transport of products and packaging from virgin materials (noting that different
recycled materials will exhibit different costs and benefits on a life-cycle basis). Increasing
recycling programs, creating new recycling programs, providing incentives for recycling
construction materials, developing markets for recycled materials, and increasing average
participation and recovery rates for all existing recycling programs can reduce overall emissions.
Increasing organics management programs, such as composting, reduces GHG emissions
associated with landfilled organic waste.
AFW-9

Landfill Methane Energy Programs

This policy promotes activities that further reduce GHG production by encouraging the use of
energy recovery technologies. The focus is on the utilization of methane at landfills through the
enabling of anaerobic digesters to capture and utilize that energy through electric power, heating,
or liquefied natural gas. These technologies will help reduce GHG emissions from waste
management, while producing cleaner energy. They make a twofold contribution to climate
protection, by reducing emissions of methane and other GHGs into the atmosphere (via
collection and control), and offsetting energy that would have otherwise come from fossil fuels.
Methane gas generation by landfills is a GHG reduction strategy that may benefit from a capand-trade system, encouraging landfills to install flares at a minimum and possibly achieve
electric generation if the economic incentives are sufficient.

6-11

Chapter 7
Cross-Cutting Issues
Overview of Cross-Cutting Issues
Some issues relating to climate policy cut across multiple sectors. The Iowa Climate Change
Advisory Council (ICCAC) addressed such issues explicitly in a separate Cross-Cutting Issues
(CC) Subcommittee (SC). Cross-cutting options typically encourage, enable, or otherwise
support emission mitigation activities and/or other climate actions. The types of policies
considered for this sector are not readily quantifiable in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG)
reductions and costs or cost savings. Nonetheless, if successfully implemented, they help build a
foundation for other options and will contribute to GHG emission reductions and implementation
of the ICCAC’s policy options described in Chapters 3–6 of this report.
The CC SC developed options for eight policies (see Table 7-1) that were then reviewed, revised,
and ultimately adopted by the ICCAC members present and voting. Seven of the options are
focused on enabling GHG emission reductions and mitigation activities, while one (CC-7Adaptation and Vulnerability) addresses adaptation to the changes expected from the effects of
GHGs that will remain in the atmosphere for decades.

Key Challenges and Opportunities
The ICCAC was charged with identifying a baseline case and GHG reduction scenarios with at
least one of those scenarios aimed at achieving a 50% reduction of GHGs below a baseline year
by 2050. in addition, the ICCAC chose to look at a second scenario aimed at achieving a 90%
reduction of GHGs below the baseline by 2050. ICCAC established 2005 as the baseline year
and identified a short-term target of reducing the 2005 GHG baseline by 1% by 2012 and a midterm target of 11% by 2020 on the way to a 50% reduction by 2050. In the second scenario
ICCAC identified a short-term target of reducing the 2005 GHG baseline by 3% by 2012 and a
mid-term target of 22% by 2020 on the way to a 90% reduction by 2050.
The ICCAC based its options on its review of the potential overall emission reduction estimates
(as compared to the GHG emissions inventory and forecast for business as usual) for 37 of 54
policy options for which emission reductions were quantified. It also considered the goals and
scenarios adopted by several other states in its deliberations. While 17 other ICCAC policy
options were not readily quantifiable, some of them would most likely achieve additional
reductions, including several of the Cross-Cutting policy options.
The ICCAC just completed its first year of operation and has at least two more years to function
under the original legislation. One of the first challenges it has is to develop its ongoing role and
the priority areas it should focus on first following completion of this report. It will need to
develop more detailed implementation plans and strategies to carry out many of the initiatives

7-1

proposed herein. A key challenge will be to identify resources that can be used to facilitate
development of such implementation plans and strategies. A closely related challenge for the
state will be to identify available resources needed to implement many of the initiatives outlined
in this report. ICCAC will need to work closely with the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
(DNR), the Iowa Power Fund and the Iowa Energy Center to examine these opportunities.

Cross-cutting issues include policies that apply across the board to all sectors and activities.
Cross-cutting options typically encourage, enable, or otherwise support emission mitigation
activities and/or other climate actions. The ICCAC developed eight such policy options for
implementation in Iowa. All are enabling policy options that are not quantified in terms of tons
of GHG reduction or costs.

7-2

Detailed descriptions of the individual Cross-Cutting policy options as presented to and approved
by the ICCAC can be found in Appendix J of this report. Following are highlights of some of the
options approved by ICCAC:
The state needs to enhance its capacity to conduct inventory, forecasting, reporting and registry
functions. It should have the capacity to inventory and forecast all statewide anthropogenic
sources and sinks annually with projections out twenty years. It needs to develop a mandatory
GHG emission reporting system for sources over de minimis levels and will need to formulate
consistent protocols to use in doing so.
ICCAC is presenting two GHG reduction scenarios to the Governor and Legislature to meet a
50% and a 90% reduction level, respectively, below 2005 levels by 2050. It is anticipated that
the Legislature will take up the issue of goals and scenarios in the 2009 session and may provide
more specific direction regarding selection of short, mid and long-term reduction goals and
scenarios. If so the ICCAC may be called on to assist in prioritizing and designing more detailed
implementation strategies. The state should also develop a tracking system to measure progress
over time in achieving GHG reductions against the above goals and scenarios.
The state has already embarked on numerous initiatives to reduce GHG emissions and will need
to continue to do so. ICCAC suggests that the Governor should consider establishing a
Governors Challenge to the state agencies and people of Iowa to find more reductions. The state
should also assist local governments in their efforts to join the state in “leading by example” to
find more reductions. The state and local governments should find additional energy efficiencies
and GHG reductions in their procurements for buildings, vehicle fleets and office equipment.
A key to building a broad base of awareness and support for the policy options included in this
report will require a public education and outreach effort. The ICCAC has identified numerous
strategies over the next three years to do so in conjunction with academic, business, local
government and other partners in this process.
Given Iowa’s vulnerability to impacts of climate change the state should develop a Climate
Change Adaptation Plan to identify plan for and manage these impacts.
The state is a participant in the Midwestern Governors Climate Accord and Energy Security and
Climate Stewardship Platform. The state should continue this proactive engagement with other
states in the region in developing cost-effective multi-state reduction strategies.
Finally, it has been demonstrated that there are numerous economic and employment
opportunities associated with implementation of many of the GHG reduction policy options
being recommended by ICCAC. The Council encourages the creation of a business oriented
entity to capitalize on these opportunities to create green jobs in Iowa and to promote new
business ventures in this arena.

Cross-Cutting Issues
Policy Descriptions

CC-1.

Inventories, Forecasting, Reporting and Registry

Policy Description
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories and forecasts are essential for understanding the
magnitude of all emission sources and sinks (both man made [anthropogenic] and natural), the
relative contribution of various types of emission sources and sinks to total emissions, and the
factors that affect trends over time. Inventories and forecasts help to inform state leaders and the
public on statewide trends and mitigation opportunities and in verifying GHG reductions
associated with implementation of action plan initiatives.
GHG reporting supports tracking and management of emissions. It can help sources identify
emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks associated with possible future GHG mandates
through early participation, and construct periodic state GHG inventories. GHG reporting is a
precursor for sources to participate in GHG reduction programs, and/or a GHG emission registry,
as well as to secure “baseline protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions).
A GHG registry enables recording of GHG emissions in a central repository with “transaction
ledger” capacity to support tracking, reductions management, and “ownership” of documented
emission reductions; it offers recognition opportunities; and/or provides a mechanism for
regional, multi-state, and cross-border cooperation. Properly designed registry structures also
provide a foundation for possible future trading programs.
CC-2.

Statewide GHG Reduction Scenarios

Policy Description
To date, Iowa has not adopted any mandatory statewide GHG reduction goals. Iowa Code
Reference 455B.152(3)(a) and (b) and 455B.152(4), which the Iowa legislature passed in 2007,
requires the IDNR to establish a GHG inventory and a voluntary GHG gas registry for tracking,
managing, and crediting entities in the state that reduce their generation of GHGs. Under the
same legislation, the ICCAC is required to recommend a baseline year from which to calculate
future GHG reductions, and to develop multiple scenarios to reduce GHG emissions in Iowa by
2050, including interim years with targeted goals. A 50% reduction scenario by 2050 was
specified in the legislation, and the ICCAC in its January 1, 2008, interim report recommended
an additional scenario of 90% reduction by 2050, with subsequent scenarios to be determined for
interim years of 2012 and 2020. The baseline year for Iowa is recommended in the Interim
Report to be 2005.
Governor Culver issued the Green Government Executive Order (Executive Order 6) on
February 21, 2008, which sets the goal of reducing “the use of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil
and water in all state office buildings by at least 15% overall in the next 5 years, taking into
7-4

account growth in the state workforce and/or changes in building operations.” This follows
Governor Vilsack’s Executive Order 41 to reduce electricity and natural gas by 15% by 2010
from the year 2000 baseline. These executive orders are establishing policy goals of greater than
1.5% per year reductions in the use of fossil fuels for state building operations in the near term,
and presumably they will result in similar GHG reductions for state buildings if fully
implemented.
Legislation in 2007 also produced the Iowa Office of Energy Independence (OEI) and the Iowa
Plan for Energy Independence. The plan “shall provide cost effective options and strategies for
reducing the state’s consumption of energy, dependence on foreign sources of energy, use of
fossil fuels, and GHG emissions. The options and strategies developed in the plan shall provide
for achieving energy independence from foreign sources of energy by the year 2025.” In
addition, the Midwestern Governors Association adopted the Energy Security and Climate
Stewardship Platform for the Midwest, which specifies an energy efficiency goal of at least 2%
per year reduction in natural gas and electricity use to be achieved by 2015.
Transitioning from the fossil fuel age to a new mix of energy sources like energy conservation,
efficiency, cellulosic biofuels, and wind power is already creating “green collar” jobs and
invigorating the economy in Iowa. Early action alternatives have much greater effect in
mitigating future climate change and its impacts compared to later reductions. Reductions for
developed countries in the range of 25%–40% by 2020 and 80%–95% by 2050 were discussed in
the initial Bali round of the Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2007. It is
recognized that “substantial deviation from baseline” will also be necessary for developing
economies in Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia, and centrally planned Asia.
CC-3.

State and Local Government GHG Emissions (Lead by Example)

Policy Description
State of Iowa property belongs to all Iowans, and its expansion and upkeep is funded by Iowans’
tax dollars. The same is true for each Iowan’s public school and city or county government. The
majority of Iowans believe strong action is required to reduce GHG emissions. Government
buildings, office equipment, and vehicles are present in every Iowa community and are among
the biggest energy consumers in the state. As such, they represent a very significant opportunity
for changing the course of Iowa’s energy use.
State and local governments should be at the forefront of energy efficiency and renewable
energy. By installing the most efficient technology and tapping local power sources,
governments can reduce their own GHG emissions, create a significant opportunity for
businesses to create and install efficient and/or renewable technologies, create a tested pool of
Iowa-specific best practices, build communities’ sense of pride in their governments (perhaps
boosted by tax decreases and economic benefit), and spur residents and businesses to pursue
energy efficiency and renewable energy.

CC-4.

Public Education and Outreach

Policy Description
The goal of climate change education extends well beyond the goal of conventional education,
because it seeks not only to impart cognitive knowledge, but also to translate knowledge into
positive action. Failure to appreciate this distinction has led to stagnation and lack of successful
approaches in creating a public that is literate about issues relevant to climate change. According
to the seminal work of Hungerford and Volk (1990),1 there are three levels of environmental
awareness:
•

Simple Awareness—Knowing about the existence and importance of an environmental issue,
but being unfamiliar with its complexities and having little relationship to personal change or
action.

•

Personal Conduct Knowledge—Understanding an environmental issue that lends itself to
changes in personal conduct, but does not require detailed comprehension.

•

Environmental Literacy—The outcome of a sound program of environmental education in
which the learner progresses to deeper knowledge, and can apply it to address complex
environmental issues and make wiser decisions.

Public education and outreach programs should address the public’s responsibility to maintain
clean air, pure water, and fertile soil for their children and future generations. Adding to the
challenge is that environmental information absorbed by the public stems from a diverse and
unconnected smattering of sources that includes television, radio, print media, environmental
groups, government publications, the Internet, the classroom, personal readings, chatting with
friends, and other experiences. In general there is no quality control for the information. In the
end, those seeking to learn about environmental issues are often left with little more than a
collection of factoids, numerous and often conflicting opinions, and very little understanding—
not enough to get beyond the “simple awareness” level cited above. Undoubtedly, excellent
resources are available for public environmental education, but they may be lost in the
background noise emanating from the cacophony of messages from disparate other sources.
There is not much detailed information about the level of climate change awareness in Iowa. The
available evidence, however, suggests that it may not extend much past “simple awareness,”
because there doesn’t appear to be significant change in personal conduct with respect to steps
that would mitigate climate change. For example, optimizing energy efficiency is a major
strategy for reducing GHG emissions, but a recent comprehensive study commissioned by the
Iowa Utility Association shows enormous untapped potential in realizing that goal for Iowa.

There is an urgent need for a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative climate change
education campaign for Iowa that will improve the knowledge base and motivate individuals,
communities, and organizations to take action to will reduce their GHG emissions.
CC-5.

Tax and Cap Policies

Policy Description
The lead for developing this policy option was transferred by the ICCAC to the Clean and
Renewable Energy Subcommittee. (See Chapter 4.)
CC-6.

Seek Funding and Financing for Implementation of ICCAC Options

Policy Description
Funding must be obtained to implement some ICCAC options. In Iowa there are two
organizations that fund projects related to the ICCAC goals: the Iowa Power Fund and the Iowa
Energy Center. (See Appendix J for a description of these organizations.) Out-of-state and
federal funding sources should also be considered. For all sources of funding, success would be
enhanced through partnerships with other organizations and agencies.
CC-7.

Adaptation and Vulnerability

Policy Description
Because of the existing buildup of GHGs in the atmosphere from past and current emissions,
Iowa will experience effects of climate change for years to come, even if immediate action is
taken to reduce its future GHG emissions. While Iowa may be less dramatically affected than
coastal or arid regions of the country, the state will need to adapt to different sets of
vulnerabilities, which may include impacts such as increased public health risks, urban
infrastructure demands, and refugee movement. Thus, it is essential that the state develop a plan
to manage the projected impacts of global climate change affecting Iowa, while broader
mitigation efforts to lower atmospheric concentrations worldwide are being developed and
implemented. Part of our adaptation must include strategies for mitigating and addressing human
suffering, so that no one segment of the population or any of Iowa's natural resources or natural
heritage sites suffers catastrophically.
CC-8.

Participate in Regional and Multi-State GHG Reduction Efforts

Policy Description
Regional approaches undertaken in collaboration with partner states or other organizations can
offer broader and more economically efficient opportunities to reduce GHG emissions across
Iowa’s economy. Iowa has already joined several organizations, including the Midwestern
Greenhouse Gas Accord, the Midwestern Governors Energy Security and Climate Stewardship
Platform, and multistate Climate Registry initiatives. These developments should be continued
and should form the basis for Iowa’s own programs. To the extent that Iowa’s needs may not be
7-7

fully met by these initiatives, Iowa should consider developing supplemental or ancillary registry
capacity or opportunity. (See CC-1.)
CC-9.

Encourage the Creation of a Business-Oriented Organization to Facilitate Investment
in Climate-Related Business Opportunities and to Share Information and Strategies,
Recognize Successes, and Support Aggressive GHG Reduction Goals

Policy Description
Numerous economic and business opportunities can arise from implementing a comprehensive
GHG reduction strategy for Iowa. A variety of job creation possibilities are implicit in new
approaches to transportation, land use, green construction, recycling and reuse, and energyefficient products and services. The state should work with public and private entities to identify,
promote, and finance these opportunities for economic development and job creation. Iowa
should also work to keep existing green jobs in Iowa and prevent them from moving out of state.
The growth of the “green industry” has the potential to benefit low- to mid-skill workers who can
no longer depend on traditional manufacturing jobs. Since green jobs require applied technical
skills, they generally pay decent wages. Unlike blue-collar jobs, many green-collar jobs require
local employees and cannot be outsourced.
Another component of economic development is the promotion of buying locally-produced
foods, goods, and products. Consumer support for the local economy helps sustain Iowa
businesses, jobs, and tax base, while reducing the consumption of fuel (and CO2 emissions) in
the transportation of foods and products over great distances.

Description of the Iowa Climate Change
Action Council Process
The following memo laying out the work plan and process the Iowa Climate Change Advisory
Council (ICCAC) would use in developing its recommendations was presented at the Council’s
second meeting, December 13, 2008.

Memorandum
To:

Iowa Department of Natural Resources

CC:

Dr. Jerry Schnoor, University of Iowa, ICCAC Chair

From: The Center for Climate Strategies
Re:

Work Plan for the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council Process

Date:

December 13, 2007

This memorandum outlines the proposed work plan for the Iowa Climate Change Advisory
Council (ICCAC). Initially, the purpose and goals of the process are described, including the
proposed general outline of the Final Report and the overall timing and milestones. Also
described are the design of the process, including key principles and guidelines. A set of
general ICCAC meeting agendas follows, showing the progression of the process over time.
Finally, an outline of the budget and funding plan are presented, along with a description of the
project team.

Purpose and Goals of the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council
In the 2007 legislative session, Gov. Culver signed into law SF 485, which requires the
development of a greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory and voluntary registry and also establishes
the Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council. This Council is charged with identifying
opportunities for Iowa to respond to the challenge of global climate change by becoming more
energy efficient and energy independent while spurring economic growth. The Governor and the
Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) have asked the Center for Climate Strategies
(CCS) to assist the ICCAC in developing an Iowa climate action plan. ICCAC members voted to
endorse this request and role by CCS at its opening meeting on October 18 and on a
subsequent ICCAC conference call on November 15, 2007. Through this memorandum, we are
responding to the request, asking for review and approval of our proposed work plan and
making a commitment to provide substantial cost share to ensure success of the project. Upon
approval, we propose to move quickly to support the process.
The ICCAC is a broad-based group of Iowa stakeholders charged with making a comprehensive
set of state-level policy recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly in a climate
action plan. CCS proposes to facilitate the ICCAC in a consensus-building process, in close

B-1

coordination with the IDNR and the ICCAC Chair, Dr. Jerry Schnoor (professor of civil and
environmental engineering at the University of Iowa).
The goals of the ICCAC process include
1. Review and approval of a current and comprehensive planning inventory and forecast of
GHG emissions in Iowa from 1990 to 2025. 1
2. Development of a recommended set of individual policy recommendations and scenarios to
reduce GHG emissions in Iowa to meet one goal of 50% reduction by 2050, as well as
short-term, medium-term, and long-term scenarios to reduce statewide GHG emissions
while considering the cost-effectiveness of the scenarios.
3. Development of recommended baselines for establishing targets for statewide reductions in
the amount of GHGs emitted by activities in Iowa by January 1, 2008, as well as
establishing short-term, medium-term, and long-term GHG emission reduction targets by
December 31, 2008.

Final Report
The ICCAC Final Report to the Governor and General Assembly is expected no later than
December 31, 2008. It will compile and summarize the final recommendations of the ICCAC and
cover the following areas:
1. Executive Summary
2. History and Status of State Actions
3. Inventory and Forecast of Iowa GHG Emissions
4. Proposed Goals for Reducing GHG Emissions in Iowa
5. Recommended Policy Actions by Sector
a. Energy Supply
b. Residential, Commercial, and Industrial
c. Transportation and Land Use
d. Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management
e. Cross-Cutting Issues (such as Emissions Reporting, Registries, Education, and Goals)
6. Technical Appendixes

Timing and Milestones
The first in-person meeting of the ICCAC was held October 18, 2007. The next meeting is
scheduled for December 17, 2007. A total of six additional meetings will be held according to
the schedule outlined below. CCS will issue the Final Report of the ICCAC after its final
meeting. For each of the five Subcommittees (SCs) of ICCAC, two or more teleconference calls
or meetings will be held between each of the ICCAC meetings.

Design of the Process
The ICCAC process will follow the format of CCS policy development processes used
successfully in a number of current and completed state-level climate action planning initiatives.
The CCS planning process combines techniques of alternative dispute resolution, community
collaborative decision making, and corporate strategic planning in a form of facilitation and
technical analysis known as “evaluative facilitation.” This consensus-building model supports
informed and collaborative self-determination by a broadly representative group of designated
stakeholders and technical experts. Activities of the ICCAC will be transparent, inclusive,
stepwise, fact-based, and consensus driven. The ICCAC process will seek but not mandate
consensus and will use formal voting to determine the level of support for individual options.
The ICCAC process relies on intensive use of information and interaction and requires
substantial organization and communication among facilitators, participants, and technical
analysts. CCS will oversee and manage this information exchange and decisional process in
partnership with the IDNR. CCS will provide central coordination of ICCAC and SC activities
through a project director team and a group of CCS technical facilitators and consultants. The
CCS team provides close coordination of ICCAC, SC, facilitation, and technical support
activities.
To facilitate learning, collaboration, and task completion by the ICCAC members, CCS will
provide a series of decision templates for each step in the process, including a catalog of state
actions with ranking criteria, a balloting form for identification of initial priorities for analysis, a
policy option template for drafting and analysis of individual recommendations, a quantification
principles and guidelines document for each SC, and a format for the Final Report.

CCS will also provide meeting materials for each ICCAC meeting and SC teleconference call,
including a PowerPoint presentation of the discussion items, an agenda and notice of the
meeting, a draft summary of the previous meeting for review and approval, and additional
handouts as needed. Materials will be provided by CCS in advance through Web site posting
and e-mail notification with a goal of 7 days’ advance notice and no less than 48 hours advance
notice. Decision items will be noted. CCS will provide and manage a project Web site
(www.iaclimatechange.us) in close coordination with the IDNR. All Web site materials may be
reviewed by the IDNR prior to posting. Examples of CCS project Web sites can be found at
www.climatestrategies.us.
The ICCAC process includes the following key principles and guidelines:
•

The process is fully transparent. All materials considered by the ICCAC and SCs are
posted to the project Web site, and all meetings are open to the public. The
quantification of all potential policy options is transparent with respect to the data
sources, methods, key assumptions, and uncertainties used by CCS in its collaboration
with participants. In addition, policy design parameters and implementation methods for
recommended actions are fully transparent, including goal levels, timing, coverage of
parties, and implementation mechanisms. The transparency of technical analysis, policy
design, and participant viewpoints is critical to the identification and resolution of
potential conflicts.

•

The process is inclusive. A diverse group of ICCAC members, in combination with
additional SC members chosen by the IDNR and ICCAC, represent a broad spectrum of
interests and expertise in Iowa. A ground rule for participation is to be supportive of the
process, but members are free to disagree on specific decisions within the process. The
public is also invited to provide meaningful review of and input to decisions.

•

The process is stepwise. Each step of the process builds incrementally on the previous
steps toward a final product. Sufficient time, information, and interaction are provided
between steps to ensure that participants are comfortable with decisions and the results
are of high quality.

•

The process will seek but not mandate consensus. Votes will be taken by the ICCAC
at key milestones in the process in order to advance to the next steps. Alternatives that
address barriers to consensus will be developed by the ICCAC and SCs with the
assistance of CCS, as needed. Voting by the ICCAC will follow established state
procedures. A quorum requires that a simple majority of members are available to
participate. After initial votes are taken, specific barriers to consensus will be identified,
and conflicts will be resolved by developing alternatives, as needed, to proceed. Final
votes by the ICCAC include support at one of three levels: unanimous consent (no
objection), super-majority (five objections or fewer), and majority (less than half object).
Typically the early stages of the process proceed with unanimous consent or a supermajority if needed. Final recommendations may include recommendations at all three
levels. Almost all final recommendations in prior processes have enjoyed unanimous
consent, with a few falling short. The Final Report by CCS will document ICCAC
recommendations and views on each policy option, including barriers to consensus and
alternative views as needed.

•

The process is comprehensive. The ICCAC will explore solutions in all sectors and
across all potential implementation methods, including a variety of voluntary and
mandatory implementation mechanisms. The total number of policies considered and

B-4

08

Apx. B–ICCAC Process, 11-25-

recommended by the ICCAC is typically 50 or more. Recommendations may include
state-level and multistate actions (regional and national). Mitigation of all GHGs will be
examined, including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and synthetic gases. Units
will be expressed in million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (MMtCO2e).
Similarly, all forms of energy supply and use and all forms of economic development are
open for consideration as they relate to GHG mitigation actions. Any significant actions
taken by the executive or legislative branches during the process will be included in an
updated reference case forecast of emissions.
•

The process is guided by clear decision criteria for the selection and design of
recommended actions. These include consideration of 1) GHG reduction potential; 2)
cost or cost savings per ton of GHGs removed (i.e., “cost effectiveness”); 3) co-benefits,
including economic, environmental, and energy policy improvements; and 4) feasibility
issues.

•

The process is quantitative. Results of ICCAC decisions will include explicit
descriptions of policy design parameters and results of economic analysis.
Recommendations can include both quantified and non-quantified actions, with
emphasis on quantification of GHG reduction potential and cost or cost savings (i.e.,
cost-effectiveness) for as many recommendations as possible. Additional quantification
needs related to co-benefits or feasibility issues will be evaluated on a case-by-case
basis pending ICCAC input and available resources.

•

The process covers short-, medium-, and long-term periods of action. The time
period of analysis for emissions inventories and reference case projections includes the
years 1990–2020. Recommendations for action typically include the present to year
2020, with estimated benefit and cost impacts being reported for intermediate years
such as 2010 and 2020. These time frames can be adjusted, if needed, to consider
longer time horizons.

•

This process is implementation-oriented. The goal of the process is ultimate adoption
of specific policies by the State of Iowa, based on planning recommendations of the
ICCAC and subsequent, more detailed analyses as needed. Accordingly,
implementation, design, and feasibility issues are provided at a conceptual level
appropriate to support further consideration by the Governor and General Assembly.

Participant Roles and Responsibilities
The ICCAC process involves a number of parties with specific roles and responsibilities, as
follows:

Governor
The Governor convenes the climate action plan process and ICCAC under SF 485, appoints
members of the ICCAC, requests and receives final recommendations from the ICCAC for a
comprehensive state climate action plan, appoints a chair, acts on final recommendations as
deemed appropriate, and forwards recommendations and early reports to the Iowa General
Assembly.

IDNR
The IDNR will announce and convene the process on behalf of the Governor, recommend
additional members to the SCs, and receive recommendations from the ICCAC process through
CCS for transmittal to the Governor. The IDNR and ICCAC Chair will work in partnership with
CCS to support timely and orderly completion of tasks, good-faith participation, and resolution of
issues by ICCAC members. The Chair and IDNR will enforce ground rules, open and close
ICCAC meetings, coordinate agency activities related to support of the process, assist CCS by
providing support for successful completion of the process, and provide day-to-day assistance
to CCS with coordination, communications, logistics, and technical support.

B-9

DRAFT–DO NOT CITE OR QUOTE
08

Apx. B–ICCAC Process, 11-25-

Center for Climate Strategies
With full endorsement of the ICCAC, the Governor and the IDNR have asked CCS to partner in
forming and conducting a participatory statewide climate action planning process to meet the
goals of the ICCAC. CCS will work in partnership with the IDNR and Chair to achieve the overall
goals of the process. In this role, CCS will design the ICCAC process and provide facilitation
and technical support to the ICCAC and its SCs through a team of project managers, facilitators,
and technical analysts.
CCS serves as an impartial and expert party and does not take positions on issues or direct the
parties toward particular solutions. As such, CCS serves as a group mediator, but not as an
arbitrator. CCS will manage and facilitate meetings and votes during meetings, schedule
meetings in coordination with the Chair, develop meeting agendas, produce documents for
ICCAC and SC consideration, and perform and present technical analyses.
CCS abides by the Model Standards of Conduct for Mediators approved by the American
Arbitration Association, the Litigation Section and the Dispute Resolution Section of the
American Bar Association, and the Society of Professionals in Dispute Resolution. CCS also
ensures that adequate funding exists to successfully complete the process through private
sources.

ICCAC
The ICCAC is appointed by the Governor in consultation with the IDNR and under requirements
of SF 485. It makes final recommendations for specific climate policy actions and goals, and
approves a final Iowa GHG emissions inventory for planning purposes and forecast. 2 ICCAC
members are appointed to respond to the goals and timelines of the process. CCS will facilitate
ICCAC activities, provide supporting analysis of options under consideration, and deliberate and
cast votes in an open-group format.

Subcommittees
ICCAC SCs will be composed primarily of ICCAC members assigned to specific sector-based
SCs of interest by the IDNR, with guidance by CCS; they may include non-ICCAC individuals
with technical expertise and interest of importance to the process. The SCs will provide
guidance to ICCAC members on decisions related to milestones in the stepwise process but will
not make binding decisions or votes. SCs will also provide assistance to CCS in the
identification, design, and quantification of policy recommendations. Sector-based SCs include
a. Clean and Renewable Energy [Energy Supply under typical CCS nomenclature]
b. Energy Efficiency and Conservation [Residential, Commercial and Industrial under typical
CCS nomenclature, i.e., energy efficiency and conservation, industrial processes]
c. Transportation and Land Use
d. Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management
e. Cross-Cutting Issues (such as reporting, registries, public education, and goals)
2

This is not the same inventory for 2007 that IDNR is required to submit to the Governor and General Assembly by
September 1, 2008.

Apx. B–ICCAC Process, 11-25-

Government Agencies
Agency participants provide liaison to ICCAC and SC meetings and related activities in support
of the IDNR and CCS team by providing technical review and input. The IDNR may also appoint
agency representatives as SC members.

The Public
The public is invited to attend ICCAC meetings and provide review and input to ICCAC and SC
members. Other public input mechanisms may be developed as needed based on guidance
from the IDNR.

Participant Guidelines
ICCAC and SC members are expected to follow certain codes of conduct during the process:
•

Participants are expected to support the process and its concept fully and, through the
group process, in good faith directly collaborate toward the goals of the ICCAC and SCs.

•

Participants are expected to act as equals during the process to ensure that all members
have equal footing during deliberations and decisions.

•

Participants must attend meetings and stay current with information provided to the
group and the decisions of the group.

•

Participants are asked not to reconsider decisions already made in the stepwise
process. Once the ICCAC reaches a milestone by vote, it moves to the next step.

•

Participants represent only themselves or the organizations they were named to the
Council to act on behalf of when making ICCAC decisions. They should come to
meetings prepared to make decisions so as allow the process to move forward.

•

Participants should speak about the process only on their own behalf to the media or in
other public settings.

•

Participants should refrain from personal criticisms and provide objective, fact-based
comments and alternatives during ICCAC and SC discussions.

Project Budget
CCS and IDNR have agreed on a budget for the project. The estimated CCS budget for
completion of startup and completion of the ICCAC process covers the core facilitation process
and quantification of approximately 50 policy recommendations. Changes in the number of
meetings, number of policy options, or type of analysis may require additional budget support.

Project Funding
CCS works with a group of private foundation donors to provide cost share to its state partners
to ensure a timely and successful launch and completion of the planning processes and other
phases of the project. Key donors have pledged support for the ICCAC. Pending the approval
by IDNR of this work plan, CCS pledges adequate core commitments to launch the process and
fully fund its completion.

provide detailed documentation on current and projected emissions. The preliminary draft
report (April 2008), was reviewed by the Council and its five Subcommittees and revised to
address comments approved by the ICCAC as the process and analysis moved forward.
The final report, incorporating comments provided by the Subcommittees that were approved by
the ICCAC at their September 2008 meeting and incorporated into the final report during
October, is available at: http://www.iaclimatechange.us/Inventory_Forecast_Report.cfm. At the

Appendix E
Methods for Quantification

The following memo was presented and discussed in detail at the fifth meeting of the Iowa
Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) on June 12, 2008. It sets forth the Center for
Climate Strategies’ methods for cost analysis of the options considered for recommendation by
the Council. The specific approaches of the technical Subcommittees working in each sector
were also outlined in separate memos for each Subcommittee and provided to the Council. Those
sector specific assumptions have been incorporated into assumptions outlined in the Appendices
for each Subcommittee.

Memorandum
To:

Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council

From:

The Center for Climate Strategies

Subject:

Quantification of Climate Mitigation Policy Options

Date:

June 7, 2008

This memo summarizes key elements of the recommended methodology for estimating GHG
impacts and cost effectiveness for draft policy options for analysis considered amenable to
quantification. The quantification process is intended to support custom design and analysis of
draft policy options, and provide both consistency and flexibility. Feedback is encouraged.
Key guidelines include:
•

Focus of analysis: Net GHG reduction potential in physical units of million metric tons
(MMt) of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) and net cost per metric ton reduced in units of
dollars per metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent ($/tCO2e). Where possible, full life cycle
analysis is used to evaluate the net energy (and emissions) performance of actions (taking
into account all energy inputs and outputs to production). Net analysis of the effects of
carbon sequestration is conducted where applicable.

•

Cost-effectiveness: Because monetized dollar value of GHG reduction benefits are not
available, physical benefits are used instead, measured as dollars per metric ton of carbon
dioxide equivalent ($/tCO2e) (cost or savings per ton) or “cost effectiveness” evaluation.
Both positive costs and cost savings (negative costs) are estimated as a part of compliance
cost.

•

Geographic inclusion: Measure GHG impacts of activities that occur within the state,
regardless of the actual location of emissions reductions. For instance, a major benefit of
E-1

recycling is the reduction in material extraction and processing (e.g. aluminum production).
While a policy option may increase recycling in Iowa, the reduction in emissions may occur
where this material is produced. Where significant emissions impacts are likely to occur
outside the state, this will be clearly indicated. These emissions reductions are counted
towards the achievement of the state’s emission goal, since they result from actions taken by
the state.
•

Direct vs. indirect effects: “Direct effects” are those borne by the entities implementing the
policy recommendation. For example, direct costs are net of any financial benefits or savings
to the entity. “Indirect effects” are defined as those borne by the entities other than those
implementing the policy recommendation. Indirect effects will be quantified on a case-bycase basis depending on magnitude, importance, time available, need and availability of data.
(See additional discussion and list of examples below.)

•

Non-GHG (external) impacts and costs: Include in qualitative terms where deemed
important. Quantify on a case-by-case basis as needed depending on need and where data are
readily available.

•

Discounting and annualizing: Discount a multi-year stream of net costs (or savings) to arrive
at the “net present value cost” of the cost of implementing a policy option. Discount costs in
constant 2005 dollars using a 5% annual real discount rate for the project period of 2009
through 2020 (unless otherwise specified for the particular policy option). Capital
investments are represented in terms of annualized or amortized costs through 2020. Create
an annualized cost per ton by dividing the present value cost or cost savings by the
cumulative reduction in tons of GHG emissions.

•

Time period of analysis: Count the impacts of actions that occur during the project time
period and, using annualized emissions reduction and cost analysis, report emissions
reductions and costs for specific target years of 2012 and 2020. Where additional GHG
reductions or costs occur beyond the project period as a direct result of actions taken during
the project period, show these for comparison and potential inclusion.

•

Aggregation of cumulative impacts of policy options: In addition to “stand alone” results for
individual options, estimate cumulative impacts of all options combined. In this process we
avoid simple double counting of GHG reduction potential and cost when adding emission
reductions and costs associated with all of the policy recommendations. To do so we note and
or estimate interactive effects between policy recommendations using analytical methods
where significant overlap or equilibrium effects are likely.

•

Policy design specifications and other key assumptions: Include explicit notation of timing,
goal levels, implementing parties, the type of implementation mechanism, and other key
assumptions as determined by the Iowa Climate Action Council (ICCAC).

•

Transparency: Include policy design choices (above) as well as data sources, methods, key
assumptions, and key uncertainties. Use data and comments provided by ICCAC to ensure
best available data sources, methods, and key assumptions using their expertise and
knowledge to address specific issues in Iowa. Modifications will be made through facilitated
decisions.

Examples of Direct/Indirect Net Costs and Savings
Note: These examples are meant to be illustrative.
Energy Efficiency and Conservation (EEC)/ Residential, Commercial, and
Industrial (RCI) Sectors
Direct Costs and/or Savings
• Net capital costs (or incremental costs relative to standard practice) of improved
buildings, appliances, equipment (cost of higher-efficiency refrigerator versus refrigerator
of similar features that meets standards)
•

Net operation and maintenance (O&M) costs (relative to standard practice) of improved
buildings, appliances, equipment, including avoided/extra labor costs for maintenance
(less changing of compact fluorescent light (CFL) or light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs in
lamps relative to incandescent)

•

Net fuel (gas, electricity, biomass, etc.) costs (typically as avoided costs from a societal
perspective)

•

Cost/value of net water use/savings

•

Cost/value of net materials use/savings (for example, raw materials savings via recycling,
or lower/higher cost of low-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants)

•

Direct improved productivity as a result of industrial measures (measured as change in
cost per unit output, for example, for an energy/GHG-saving improvement that also
speeds up a production line or results in higher product yield)

Indirect Costs and/or Savings
• Re-spending effect on economy
•

Overlap Discussion
The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) and the Energy Efficiency and
Conservation Subcommittee (EEC SC) have developed 14 policy options to reduce the emissions
of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the residential, commercial, and industrial (RCI) sector. In
addition to estimating the impacts of each individual policy option, the combined impacts of the
policy options in each sector were estimated, assuming that all were implemented together. This
involved eliminating any overlaps in coverage that would occur to avoid double counting of
impacts. Also, some of the policy options in one sector overlapped with policy options in another
sector; therefore, these overlaps were identified and the impact analysis was adjusted to eliminate
double counting of impacts associated with these intersectoral overlaps. The following section
identifies where these overlaps occurred and explains the methods used to adjust the impacts
analysis to avoid double counting of impacts.
EEC Cumulative Impacts Analysis Methodology
To assess the cumulative emission reductions for the policies in the RCI sector, it is necessary to
consider any overlaps among the policy options that affect similar types of energy use.
Specifically, some policies (such as EEC-3) are defined by their goals for reducing energy use,
while others (such as EEC-12 and EEC-2) are defined by addressing a specific type of energy
use. Policies were compared in terms of the type of energy use they target and the energy
reduction strategies they implement. Overlaps were identified and quantified by sector (RCI or
government/institutional), type of energy use targeted (water heating, space heating, etc.), and
measure (e.g., solar hot water). If a policy’s impact by sector and type of energy use was less
than the impact from an overlapping policy for that same sector and type of energy use, it was
excluded from the cumulative analysis.
EEC-3 provides tax incentives and other mechanisms that are not covered by utility and
nonutility energy efficiency programs. Nonetheless, from the perspective of the practical,
achievable potential for the deployment of energy efficiency through 2020, there is significant
overlap with EEC-12. This option does not overlap with EEC-2 because, as it is quantified, it
does not target natural gas efficiency. In contrast, this option is more aggressive in deploying
energy efficiency, as it assumes that 2% of retail sales are conserved by 2010, while this level is
not achieved in EEC-12 until 2016. For this reason, this option is assumed to overlap with EEC12 by 85%, and its delivered reductions in energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) are reduced by this
amount.
EEC-4 improved building codes don’t overlap with EEC-12 and EEC-2, at least in theory,
because EEC-12 and EEC-2 should be either applied to existing demand or would be for energy
efficiency improvements beyond new codes. There are no overlaps for this option.
EEC-5 includes financial mechanisms, such as decoupling utility revenues from sales of
electricity or natural gas, allowing utilities to rate-base their energy efficiency expenditures and
earn returns on these investments, and allowing utilities to earn interest on customer loans for
energy efficiency equipment. In theory, these implementation mechanisms will provide new
sources of funding for energy efficiency measures and thus increase their deployment. However,
this measure targets an incremental 1.5% of retail sales being conserved via energy efficiency by
2012, which, when combined with EEC-12, would exceed achievable levels of programmatic
F-2

energy efficiency. 1 Furthermore, the load management and time-of-use measures overlap with
EEC-11. This option is assumed to overlap 90% with other options.
EEC-6 looks for ways to improve the efficiency of new buildings and major retrofits beyond
existing building codes. Several of the measures that could be used to achieve this are placing
caps on consumption of energy per unit area of floor space for new buildings and encouraging
building commissioning and recommissioning, including energy tracking and benchmarking.
While these measures might improve energy efficiency, they are largely captured under EEC-4
and EEC-12 and EEC-2. This option is assumed to overlap 90% with other options.
EEC-8 focuses on low-income residents who may not receive energy efficiency investments
under utility demand-side management (DSM) programs. However, well-designed DSM
programs should target low-income residences. This option also targets residential and
commercial energy consumers who have significant disincentives for investing in energy
efficiency measures due to landlord-tenant market failures. It targets minimum efficiency goals
for rental properties, such as using compact fluorescent light bulbs and energy-efficient
appliances, with inspections occurring with the departure of current tenants via a pre-rental
inspection program before a new tenant takes possession. This option is assumed to overlap 75%
with EEC-12 and EEC-2.
EEC-9 adheres to the Midwestern Governors Association (MGA) target for energy efficiency. It
is 100% redundant to EEC-12, and is eliminated from the adjusted cumulative totals.
EEC-10 provides a certification program for building operators. Utilities already have such
programs, but their reach isn’t as large as envisioned under this policy. This option is assumed to
overlap 90% with EEC-12 and EEC-2.
EEC-11 quantifies the reduced use of electricity due to more rational pricing mechanisms, such
as real-time pricing. Higher prices result in lower energy use overall. The quantification of this
option explicitly excludes conservation measures, such as high-efficiency air conditioners and
chillers, which are included in EEC-12. This option does not overlap with any others.
The government high-efficiency building standards in EEC-13 typically show little overlap with
utility programmatic investments and are additional to code improvements. This option does not
overlap with any others.
EEC-14 deploys ENERGY STAR equipment in government, residential, commercial, and industrial
facilities. It also raises appliance efficiency standards for products not covered by federal
standards, although the list of products that are eligible for state standards shrank considerably
after the passage of the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) in 2007. EEC-12 and
EEC-2 also provide incentives for customers to purchase efficient appliances and office
equipment. This option is assumed to overlap 75% with EEC-12 and EEC-2 and other policy
options.
1

The report prepared by Quantec LLC for the Iowa Utilities Association, Assessment of Energy and Capacity
Savings Potential in Iowa, Volume II, shows the best utility programs in the country are able to achieve incremental
energy efficiency investments of slightly over 2% of energy sales (p. I-10). Thus, the combined energy targets under
EEC-5 and EEC-12/EEC-2 would be impractical to attain.
F-3

Overlaps Between Sectors
The electricity energy efficiency investments from the suite of EEC policy options reduce
electricity demand and thus make it possible to meet renewable energy mandates more costeffectively. For example, under EEC-12, electricity demand in 2020 is reduced by almost 5,000
gigawatt-hours (GWh) versus the reference case. Clean and Renewable Energy option CRE-8b
assumes a 20% renewable portfolio standard (RPS) by 2020, which is 4% more of renewable
sources of energy (as a percentage of retail sales) than is forecasted under the reference case.
Therefore, the implementation of EEC-12 would require 200 GWh fewer of renewable resources
to meet the RPS target. Using the renewable energy cost assumptions for CRE-8b, the reduced
spending on renewables that cost more than reference case generation in 2020 would result in
savings of $0.3 million in that year.
Finally, an additional feedback is that certain CRE policies will have the effect of reducing the
GHG emissions associated with energy production, so that EEC policies that target electricity
use will have a reduced impact on overall emissions. However, this impact is small and has not
been reflected in the analysis beyond the avoided CO2 methodology that assumes in the later
years of the program that 21% new renewables are avoided by implementing the EEC options.
See the Annex to this document for a discussion of the avoided CO2 methodology.

Reductions from Recent Actions
Recent actions are accounted for in the summary table as policies that have been enacted, but
that are not in the reference case Iowa inventory and forecast. These include the federal Energy
Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, which was signed into law in December 2007.
This law contains several requirements that will reduce GHG emissions as they are implemented
over the next few years. During the ICCAC process, sufficient information was identified (e.g.,
implementation schedules) to estimate GHG emission reductions associated with implementing
energy efficiency requirements for new appliances and lighting in Iowa under Title III of the
EISA. 2 The 2020 residential electricity savings are estimated at 5.5% of sales, and natural gas
savings are estimated at 1% of sales from more efficient residential furnaces. The net effect of
these reductions was estimated at 1,300 GWh of electricity, and 1,300 billion British thermal
units (BBtu) of natural gas savings in Iowa by 2020. The associated GHG reductions for these
savings are projected to be 1.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MMtCO2e) for
2020 using the EEC CO2 methodology. Note, however, that GHG emission reductions associated
with the EISA Title IV (Energy Savings in Buildings and Industry) and Title V (Energy Savings
in Government and Public Institutions) requirements have not been quantified because of the
uncertainties about how they will be implemented.

F-4

Also, Iowa’s Executive Orders #41 (Governor Vilsack) 3 and #6 (Governor Culver) 4 to reduce
energy use in state buildings will also have an impact on future GHG emissions. The avoided
electricity and natural gas GHG emissions are estimated at about 0.30 MMtCO2e in 2020. These
actions are expected to achieve annual energy reductions from state government operations of
5% for 3 years for Executive Order #41 (2007–2010) and 2% a year for 7 years (2008–2015) for
Executive Order #6. These forecasted reductions are reduced by implementation rates of 60%
and 80%, respectively. The less than 100% implementation rate assumes Executive Order #41 is
benchmarked relative to the year 2000, which reduces the energy reduction achievement in
current energy levels. Also, there are other means by which state facilities cannot participate in
the programs. The reductions from these recent actions are reflected in the energy and GHG
reductions quantified in EEC-13.
As mentioned in the text below, Iowa utilities have been pursuing energy efficiency programs for
some time. These investments are not quantified in the analysis because EEC SC members
indicated that the energy impacts from these efficiency programs are already incorporated into
the utility load growth forecasts that were used for the reference case inventory and forecast (i.e.,
they are already in the baseline). The assumed incremental (new) statewide energy efficiency
investments are equal to 0.82% of retail natural gas sales, and 0.69% of electricity sales over the
planning period. These investments are deducted from each of the relevant energy efficiency
targets in the individual policy options. For example, the energy efficiency target in EEC-12
(culminating at 2% of retail sales) is reduced by 0.69% to an incremental 1.31% of new
investments by 2020. This approach avoids double counting reductions from existing programs
in the policy options. Assuming incremental energy efficiency investments from existing actions
in Iowa remained unchanged from 2006 levels, Iowa’s cumulative electric energy efficiency
deployment would be approximately 15% of sales in 2020. For natural gas, Iowa’s cumulative
natural gas energy efficiency deployment would be approximately 19% of sales in 2020. When
using the levelized cost estimate assumptions developed for the RCI sector, total utility and
participant spending on energy efficiency/DSM from existing actions in the reference case is
estimated at $270 million in 2020.
The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) is reviewing investor-owned utility plans to increase incremental
electricity and natural gas investments to 1.5% of natural gas and electricity sales. Because these
plans have not been approved, they are not included in the quantitative analyses. However, these
targets are similar to those of options EEC-2 and EEC-12 for natural gas and electricity, with the
primary difference that the two ICCAC options escalate to investments equal to 2% of sales later
in the planning period.

EEC-1. Consumer Education Programs

Policy Description
The ultimate effectiveness of emission reduction activities in many cases depends on providing
information and education to consumers regarding the GHG emission implications of their
choices. Public education and outreach is vital to fostering a broad awareness of climate change
issues and effects (including co-benefits, such as clean air and public health) among the state’s
citizens. Such awareness is necessary to engage citizens in actions to reduce GHG emissions in
their personal and professional lives. Public education and outreach efforts should integrate with
and build upon existing outreach efforts involving climate change and related issues in the state.
Ultimately, public education and outreach will be the foundation for the long-term success of all
of the mitigation actions proposed in the climate change planning process, as well as those that
may evolve in the future.
This option focuses on public education and outreach to stimulate decisions that yield energy
efficiency savings. Consumer education is an integral component of most existing DSM
programs offered by investor-owned and consumer-owned utilities.
Policy Design
Goals: Achieve at least a 5% reduction in residential energy consumption.
Timing: 1% reduction beginning in 2010 and increased linearly to 5% in 2020.
Implementing Parties: Iowa Office of Energy Independence, community colleges, secondary
schools, building professional trade groups, utilities.
Implementation Mechanisms
Possible policy mechanisms include:
•

Evaluate techniques for assessing the impact of various educational efforts, and disseminate
standard methodology to utilities, the IUB, and others.

•

Use the 2007 Iowa Residential Energy Survey to guide educational programs and efforts.

•

Implement energy districts. Energy districts are based on the conservation district model of
the 1930s and 1940s that created a unique local-state-federal partnership to bring
conservation technical and financial assistance to every farm. This locally led process could
make energy efficiency a highly visible local economic development tool. Districts could
participate in national programs; partner with local business for a “distributed efficiency
storefront”; develop agricultural energy initiatives with local conservation district, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Extension partners; develop a local carbon offset
program with funds and offsets entirely within county; and work with utilities to encourage
local distributed generation.

F-6

•

Work with the Center for Energy and Environmental Education (CEEE) at the University of
Northern Iowa (UNI), the Iowa Department of Education, and other appropriate agencies to
better incorporate energy efficiency in education curricula.

•

Develop and present/distribute seminars and/or publications aimed at residential consumers
about state/federal tax credits for investment in energy-efficient technologies and practices,
what renters can do to improve energy efficiency, availability of green mortgages, and
sources for self-liquidating financing of energy efficiency technologies.

•

Develop and present/distribute seminars and/or publications aimed at housing professionals
(builders, architects, realtors, appraisers, bankers, landlords, and others) to extend
information about green mortgages, self-liquidating financing, ENERGY STAR, National
Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
home certification standards, and benefits of efficiency investments by landlords.

•

Develop and present/distribute seminars and/or publications aimed at commercial and
industrial consumers to extend information about tax credits, best practices, and such
available resources as the Industrial Assessment Center (IAC) at Iowa State University
(ISU), the National Building Control Information Program, NAHB, Iowa Energy Center
(IEC), etc.

•

Develop and present/distribute seminars and/or publications aimed at heating, ventilation,
and air conditioning (HVAC) contractors. (Utilities are starting to require very high levels of
service that many contractors cannot provide right now.)

•

Display energy efficiency measures in retail outlets and other public settings.

•

Determine education efforts that will be needed to support other new/expanded energy
efficiency initiatives, including (1) expand the Weatherization Assistance Program to make
the homes of low-income Iowans more energy efficient, (2) develop minimum energy
efficiency standards and enforcement mechanism for rental properties, (3) develop financial
incentives to more effectively encourage retrofitting of rental properties with energy-efficient
appliances and weatherization measures, and (4) develop financing mechanisms to make
energy-efficient appliances affordable for everyone.

•

Utilize and promote ISU’s IAC to extend information about energy efficiency to Iowa
business and industry. Encourage development of K-12 energy efficiency curricula.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Municipal utilities, through the Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities (IAMU), have developed
a new direct mail energy and environmental magazine called Eco@Home. IAMU is also
developing an energy-related “town meeting kit” for its members.
While utility energy efficiency plans must be cost-effective, the Iowa General Assembly (2007
session) amended Iowa Code § 476.6(14), which provides that educational programs and
assessments of consumers’ needs for information to make effective choices regarding energy use
and energy efficiency need not be cost-effective (Laws of the Eighty-Second G.A., H.F. 918).
Low-income education programs delivered by Community Action Program (CAP) agencies
through investor-owned energy efficiency programs include the following:
F-7

•

Energy efficiency curriculum developed by MidAmerican Energy.

•

School energy efficiency kits (4th–6th grades) distributed by Aquila.

•

IEC “shall cooperate with the state board of education in developing a curriculum which
promotes energy efficiency and conservation” (Iowa Code § 266.39C(4)). After experiencing
difficulties implementing a statewide energy curriculum (see Feasibility issues below), IEC
has sponsored Iowa teachers (covering both conference and travel expenses) to attend NEED
(National Energy Education Development) training conferences. With a range of sponsors
and a core staff, NEED has materials available and continuously up to date. In recent years,
the NEED training sponsorship has been extended to 4-H leaders.

•

IEC devotes the largest portions of its funds to energy efficiency research, demonstration
projects, and education projects, addressing energy use in agricultural, industrial,
commercial, municipal, and residential settings. In the last several years, IEC has developed
the Residential Home Series Booklets (www.energy.iastate.edu/homeseries/index.htm) and
has signed cooperative agreements allowing for their reproduction and use in neighboring
states.

•

USDA’s Section 9006 Renewable Energy & Energy Efficiency Program.

•

Muscatine Power & Water has been using an energy efficiency curriculum for several years
with local schools.

•

Some municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives (RECs) have educational programs or
comprehensive curricula in their service territories.

•

Independence Municipal Utilities utilizes a new program from its power supplier, Wisconsin
Public Power Inc., that may represent an emerging good practice for supporting development
of customer-owned small-scale renewable generation.

•

Wisconsin has a statewide comprehensive curriculum, called KEEP, which could serve as a
model for a similar program in Iowa.

•

CEEE has many individual programs for encouraging energy education for students.

•

Some utilities provide scholarships for Building Operator Certification training.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)
emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2 from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts
of CH4 from the transport of natural gas to end users are reduced.

EEC-2. Demand-Side Management (DSM)/Energy Efficiency Programs
for Natural Gas

Policy Description
A DSM/energy efficiency approach requires actions that influence both the quantity and the
patterns of energy consumed by end users. This policy option focuses on DSM/energy efficiency
programs run by gas utilities, and may be designed to work in tandem with other strategies that
can also encourage efficiency gains.
The 2008 session of the Iowa General Assembly passed legislation to require the establishment
of energy efficiency savings goals for all of Iowa’s municipal gas utilities and one cooperative
gas utility.
Policy Design
Goals: Invest in energy efficiency equal to 1.0% of statewide retail gas sales per year within 3
years; 1.5% per year in 5 years; and 2.0% per year in 7 years.
Timing: Phase in, beginning in 2010.
Parties Involved:
• Extend the DSM obligations and goals to all gas utilities in Iowa. Investor-owned utilities
(IOUs) are starting at 0.8%.
•

IOUs, the Iowa Utility Association, municipal utilities, IAMU, and consumer cooperatives.

Implementation Mechanisms
Possible policy mechanisms include the following:
•

Establish (via IUB) DSM goals for investor-owned utilities.

•

Revise existing statutes to incorporate prescribed energy efficiency goals.

•

Change the determination of DSM cost-effectiveness by accounting for the estimated
valuation of CO2 emissions avoided by programs.

•

Extend the energy efficiency goals and obligations to all gas utilities in Iowa.

•

Expand DSM measures eligible for program incentives.

•

Extend investor-owned natural gas program funding requirements and eligibility to natural
gas transportation customers.

•

Expand the scope of utility activity that can contribute to achieving DSM goals to account for
natural gas savings accruing when an electric utility provides incentives for installation of
geothermal systems and building shell measures in an area in which natural gas service is
available.

F-10

•

Expand the scope of utility activity that can contribute to achieving DSM goals to include
actions that are on the utility side of the meter, so-called “infrastructure” investments (a term
adopted in Minnesota in 2007).

•

Recognize the contribution of increased building energy codes and equipment energy
standards toward the achievement of DSM goals.

•

Include in the measurement of DSM goals the energy savings from renewable measures that
are implemented on the customer side of the meter.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Natural gas utilities in Iowa must offer cost-effective energy efficiency programs (Iowa Code
§ 476.6(14)). The IUB establishes energy efficiency goals for rate-regulated gas utilities (Iowa
Code § 476.6(16)). DSM offered by municipal and rural electric cooperative utilities is not
regulated. Most natural gas transportation customers served by competitive commodity suppliers
do not fund energy efficiency programs mandated in § 476.6(16) and are not eligible to
participate in these programs.
Investor-Owned Natural Gas Utilities
IOUs have a long history of conducting DSM/energy efficiency programs, under statutes adopted
in 1990 and modified in 1996. The IUB conducts contested proceedings for the review of plans,
programs, and energy savings goals developed by IOUs. New plans were filed in April 2008, and
the IUB has directed the IOUs to include analyses of the effects of goals equivalent to saving
1.5% of retail natural gas sales in Iowa.
Municipal and Cooperative Natural Gas Utilities
Although municipal gas utilities were required to file biennial energy efficiency plans, and many
have conducted DSM programs, legislation passed in 2008 requires each utility or group of
utilities to determine the maximum potential energy and capacity savings available from actual
and projected customer usage through cost-effective energy efficiency measures and programs.
Based on the energy efficiency assessment, each utility must establish an energy efficiency goal,
along with a set of cost-effective energy efficiency programs designed to meet the goal. The
process must be started by July 1, 2008, with a progress report submitted to the IUB by January
1, 2009, and a final report filed by January 1, 2010. The report must include the utility’s costeffective energy efficiency goal, and for each measure utilized by the utility in meeting the goal,
the measure’s description, projected cost, and the analysis of its cost-effectiveness. On January 1
of each even-numbered year, commencing January 1, 2012, utilities must file a report with the
IUB identifying their progress in meeting the energy efficiency goal and any updates or
amendments to their energy efficiency plans and goals. This requirement takes the place of the
current energy efficiency plan filings.
The assumed incremental (new) statewide natural gas energy efficiency investments are equal to
0.82% of retail sales over the planning period.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
For direct fuel use, CO2 emissions from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of
CH4 emissions from the transport of natural gas to end users are reduced.

Assuming incremental energy efficiency investments in Iowa remained unchanged from the
2006 levels reported in IUB (2008), Iowa’s cumulative natural gas energy efficiency deployment
would be approximately 19% of sales in 2020. When using the levelized cost estimate
assumptions developed for the EEC sector, total utility and participant spending on energy
efficiency/DSM in the reference case is estimated at $270 million in 2020. Under EEC-2,
additional energy efficiency spending is estimated at $113 million in 2020, which achieves
another cumulative 8.5% of sales.

Key Uncertainties
Energy efficiency investments most likely will not lead to reductions in utility rates, but typically
result in reduced energy expenditures (customer bills) over the life of the investment, compared
to no investments in energy efficiency.
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM investments (the avoided CO2 methodology). 5
Additional Benefits and Costs
Energy efficiency investments should reduce the bills of utility customers who make the
investments, but will probably not lead to absolute reductions in utility rates or bills for all
customers. However, cost-effective energy efficiency improvements should reduce overall utility
costs and average bills, when compared to more expensive alternatives.

EEC-3. Financial Mechanisms for Energy Efficiency

Policy Description
This option refers to financial mechanisms that could increase energy efficiency provided by
nonutility entities and investment by providing incentives to a variety of energy consumers to
improve energy performance of buildings, equipment, and residences. Some of the utilities active
in Iowa have offered such financing mechanisms in other states and for specific market segments
in Iowa. At least one Iowa utility has a pilot program for a no-interest revolving loan fund. IEC
has offered a revolving loan fund for renewable energy for a number of years.
Policy Design
Goals: Reduce electricity, natural gas, and heating fuels consumption across all end-user
categories by 2% of retail sales annually. End users include public-sector, industrial, commercial,
multifamily residential, and residential users. GHG reductions and costs of or benefits from
natural gas and heating fuels are not quantified in this option.
Timing: Initial 2% realized in 2010, with continued annual decline.
Implementing Parties: All public-sector, residential, commercial, and industrial electricity
consumers; nonutility entities delivering financial mechanisms.
Implementation Mechanisms

Currently the Iowa Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has $600,000 to direct to
public and nonprofit facilities to provide energy audits and technical assistance to follow
up on audit recommendations. New legislation allows for fees, so the program should be
self-funding. Financing for improvements through the Treasurer’s office in a
lease/purchase agreement.
Provide $1 million to expand energy audit programs for industrial, commercial, and
multifamily residential sectors, and offer assistance for building and production facilities
owners to follow up on audit recommendations.
Provide $10 million revolving low- or no-interest loan fund(s) through IEC or the Iowa
Finance Authority for energy efficiency investments, potentially targeted at industrial,
commercial, and multifamily residential energy users.
Performance contracting is a self-financing mechanism for improvements in energy
efficiency. The money saved through less energy consumption is leveraged to pay for
financing, installing, operating, and maintaining the energy efficiency measures.
Provide $10 million tax credits for purchasing appliances that meet ENERGY STAR 2007
requirements.
Provide $10 million in income tax credits to nonresidential and multifamily buildings of
at least 20,000 square feet that are constructed or rehabilitated to meet criteria set forth by
U.S. Green Building Council or other criteria. Apply credits to three types of alternative
F-15

energy sources: photovoltaics, wind turbines, and fuel cells. Allow the credits to be
claimed only if they serve a green whole building, a green base building, or green tenant
space.

EEC-4. Improved Building Codes for Energy Efficiency

Policy Description
Buildings are significant consumers of energy and other resources. Adoption and enforcement of
building energy and related codes can be an effective way to eliminate the least efficient energy
approaches in new or renovated buildings.
This policy option sets a goal for reducing building energy consumption, to be achieved by
increasing standards for the minimum performance of new and substantially renovated
commercial and residential buildings through the adoption and enforcement of building codes.
Building codes would be made more stringent via incorporation of aspects of advanced/next
generation building designs and construction standards, such as sustainable design and green
building standards. Building codes should promote further reduction of GHG emissions through
adoption of sustainable design or green building standards.
Other aspects of the policy design include:
•

Undertaking a comprehensive review of existing state and local building codes in Iowa to
determine where increased energy efficiency can be achieved. This review will be
undertaken by the new Commission on Energy Efficiency Standards and Practices,
established by legislation enacted this year.

•

Increasing the stringency of the Iowa Energy Code:
○

Residential—2006 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC)
○ Commercial—2006 IECC (including ASHRAE/IESNA [American Society of Heating,
Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers/Illuminating Engineering Society of North
America] 90.1-2004).
•

Developing a training and certification program for code officials, builders, and contractors
on energy efficiency and related sustainable design standards, and in code enforcement.

•

Providing tools to state and local governments for measuring and tracking cost savings.

•

Targeting existing buildings for efficiency improvements during both major and minor
renovation, through application and enforcement of building codes and with tax rebates or
other incentives.

•

Allowing compliance flexibility. New and substantially renovated buildings can utilize a
combination of increased energy efficiency, switching to low- and no-carbon-based fuels for
previously carbon-based end uses, making off-site purchases of grid-supplied “green power,”
and/or installing on-site off-grid low/no-CO2-emitting power-generating equipment.

•

Setting caps on consumption of energy per unit area of floor space for new buildings.

•

Requiring high-efficiency appliances in new construction and retrofits.

•

Providing incentives, such as permitting and fee advantages, tax credits, financing incentives
(such as “green mortgages”), or other measures to encourage retrofitting existing residential
F-18

and commercial buildings or developing nontraditional off-grid low-carbon and carbonneutral energy sources. The state can work with financial institutions to develop loan tools
for these programs.
Advanced/next-generation building design requirements might include use of specific materials
(e.g., local building materials), implementation of specific technologies (e.g., energy-efficient
roofing materials and landscaping to lower electricity demand), or attainment of points under an
advanced standard (e.g., green building or sustainable design). Energy-reduction targets should
be periodically reassessed.
Potential measures supporting this policy can include outreach and public education, public
recognition programs, improved enforcement of building codes, encouraging or providing
incentives for energy tracking and benchmarking, performance contracting/shared savings
arrangements, technical support resources for implementation, and development of a
clearinghouse for information on and access to software tools to calculate the impact of energy
efficiency and solar technologies on building energy performance.
Policy Design
Goals: Reduce energy consumption per square foot of floor space at new construction and
renovated buildings by 15% by 2012 and 50% by 2025.
Timing: New codes become effective initially in 2010, and the final goal is achieved by 2025.
Implementing Parties: Department of Public Safety (code adoption, enforcement), local
governments, builders, contractors, developers, trade associations (Master Builders Association,
NAHB, architects, American Institute of Architects (AIA)–Iowa Chapter, etc.).
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Require the periodic and regular (no less than every 3 years) review and adoption of state and
local building codes, particularly energy efficiency requirements, to ensure best management
practices. At least every 3 years, the state will review (with opportunity for public comment)
and adopt more stringent standards for energy efficiency.

•

Develop more effective energy building code enforcement mechanisms and monitor
compliance.

•

Developing a training and certification program for code officials and contractors on energy
efficiency codes and sustainable design standards.

•

Develop mechanisms to facilitate enforcement in areas of the state where there is currently
no building code enforcement.

•

Extend enhanced tax credits for “green development” of brownfields and grayfields, starting
in 2009. The enhanced tax credits will require compliance with the sustainable design
standards established by the Building Code Commissioner.

Commissioner.

EEC-5. Incentives for Energy Efficiency

Policy Description
The IUB is charged with responsibility for energy efficiency programs and energy efficiency
plans by Iowa utilities. IOUs conduct energy efficiency programs under plans that are reviewed
and approved by the IUB. Consumer-owned utilities (municipal utilities and electric
cooperatives) operate voluntary plans and programs, but must provide reports on their plans to
the IUB. The 2008 session of the Iowa General Assembly passed legislation that requires RECs
and municipal electric utilities to establish energy efficiency savings goals. Energy efficiency
plans in Iowa address both electric and natural gas use through a variety of programs.
Incentive approaches are of three types: (1) incentives offered by governing bodies to utilities to
induce superior utility performance in implementing DSM/energy efficiency programs, (2)
incentives offered by utilities to customers to induce them to participate in and invest in
programs, and (3) incentives offered to other energy efficiency stakeholders.
Policy Design
Goals: Equivalent of 5% of retail sales improvement in energy efficiency from Type 1 incentives
5% improvement from Type 2, and 5% for Type 3.
Timing: Incentives offered and energy improvements realized beginning 2012.
Implementing Parties: Residential and commercial property owners and tenants, government
housing and other state and federal government agencies, weatherization and energy service
providers, local business associations, community action agencies/human resource development
councils, such nongovernmental organizations as Habitat for Humanity, HVAC contractors,
building contractors/design firms, lenders, retailers of energy-efficient products and services, and
residential/commercial energy audit contractors.
Implementation Mechanisms
Type 1 Incentives to Utilities
Implementation of various incentives to utilities would most likely require legislative action to
reverse the statutory decision to terminate incentives to IOUs.
Type 2 Incentives to Utility Customers
Incentives to customers of IOUs are reviewed and authorized by the IUB in contested case
proceedings for the review of energy efficiency plans. Proceedings are currently underway for
the review of new (2009–2013) energy efficiency plans. Incentives to customers or members of
municipal utilities and electric cooperatives are solely at the discretion of each customer-owned
utility.

F-23

Type 3 Incentives to Other Energy Efficiency Stakeholders, Such as Retailers, Contractors, and
Designers
Incentives to these stakeholders from IOUs are implemented after review and authorization of
utility plans by the IUB. Incentives to these stakeholders that target customers or members of
municipal utilities and electric cooperatives are solely at the discretion of each customer-owned
utility. Incentives to these stakeholders from other entities, such as units of state or local
government, would require action by those governing bodies.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Type 1 Incentives to IOUs
IOUs have a long history of conducting DSM/energy efficiency programs under statutes adopted
in 1990 and modified in 1996. The original statutes enacted in 1990 authorized the IUB to
approve incentives for IOUs. The IUB developed rules that permitted the IOUs to seek
incentives, including:
•

Carrying charges on energy efficiency program costs, which were deferred until final
approval.

•

Returns on costs approved for recovery, which were earned over a 4-year amortization
period.

•

A reward mechanism based on the net societal benefits results of each IOU's programs, up to
as much as 25% of the net societal benefits.

•

Opportunity to apply for recovery of net revenues reduced by DSM programs.

The revision of the energy efficiency statutes in 1996 removed all of these incentive
mechanisms, and substituted an automatic adjustment mechanism for cost recovery, which
accelerated IOUs’ recovery of costs and eliminated the additional costs of incentives. Incentives
are now back in discussion, based on the assumption that Iowa IOUs might improve their DSM
performance very much beyond current levels of energy and capacity savings if they are given an
incentive for doing so.
Potential mechanisms for incentives to IOUs could include the following:
•

Decouple IOU revenues from sales of electricity or natural gas.

•

Allow IOUs to rate-base their energy efficiency expenditures and earn returns on these
investments.

•

Allow IOUs to recover revenues that decrease due to DSM, net of utility system cost savings.

•

Allow IOUs to implement a revenue normalization mechanism to recognize the impacts of
declining per-customer sales due to DSM and other causes, while also recognizing additional
sales due to customer growth.

•

Allow IOUs to offer all DSM programs as shared-savings or Pay-As-You-Go loan programs,
with the interest or earnings on these loans retained as earnings by the IOUs.

•

Offer the IOUs some form of monetary reward based on amounts of capacity and energy
saved, recoverable from customers as part of DSM costs.
F-24

•

Evaluate alternative rate regulation structures to better align utility interests with energy
efficiency goals. For example, MidAmerican’s revenue sharing mechanism incorporates an
element of reward for energy efficiency because energy efficiency contributes to the utility’s
ability to sell electricity in the wholesale market and generate additional revenues that are,
pursuant to the revenue sharing arrangement, allocated between the utility and its customers.
Thus, the utility and its customers are rewarded for energy efficiency.

•

Allow IOUs to “own” all or part of the “carbon credit” impact of capacity and energy saved
by DSM programs, and to retain as earnings any funds received from sale of credits based on
these savings, above a certain level.

•

Require IOUs to document performance, and penalize IOUs that do not meet specific goals
by certain dates, to the extent that there is inadequacy in the current Iowa statutes and rules
requiring program documentation, and allow the IUB to conduct prudence reviews and
impose penalties.

Type 2 Incentives to Utility Customers
Iowa IOUs offer incentives for participation in DSM programs to customers in many forms,
including:
•

Rate discounts or payments to participants in load management programs, for savings of peak
load electric kilowatt (kW).

•

Time-of-use rates to electric customers, which offer lower rates off peak and much higher
rates during peak electric use periods.

•

Free energy audits and simple on-site energy efficiency measures installed during audits.

•

Advanced energy efficiency evaluation and design services, typically for nonresidential
customers.

•

Assistance to residential homebuilders in the form of training, inspection of homes, cash
payments for meeting standards, and certification/recognition of highly efficiency homes.

•

Rebates and loans to customers for purchasing energy-efficient appliances and equipment.

•

Customer education and training on energy-efficient appliances and measures (insulation,
infiltration, building weatherization measures, HVAC sizing and maintenance, etc.).

Other customer incentives may be possible.
Type 3 Incentives, to Other Energy Efficiency Stakeholders
Another solution to the assumption that Iowa IOUs will not improve their DSM performance
very much beyond current levels of energy and capacity savings is to transfer the administration
of energy efficiency programs to an independent, third-party administrator. The administrator
would be subject to a performance-based compensation structure, including incentives for
superior performance.
Another means of overcoming the utilities’ disincentive to aggressively promote DSM programs
and achieve energy efficiency results is to replace the current system of utility-administered
incentives with a system that provides incentives directly to retailers of energy-efficient products
F-25

and services, energy-efficient product lenders, and building contractors/designers. Some utilities
currently offer these stakeholders incentives to promote energy-efficient products, including
training, free publicity, and per-item restocking payments to dealers and sales people for
promotion of energy-efficient appliances and equipment. Similarly, incentives could be paid
directly to marketing firms to advertise and educate consumers about energy-efficient products
and energy efficiency services.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural

quantified.
•

Peak avoided costs and levelized costs are assumed to be the same as from EEC-12

•

The energy efficiency programs begin in 2012 and end after 2030.

The three types of incentives will each improve efficiency by 5.0% over the improvements
made in EEC-12.

•

DSM/energy efficiency programs are assumed to displace marginal sources of generation
(50% coal, 50% gas) through 2012. From 2013 on, the programs are assumed to displace the
new-build mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% gas.

•

Energy efficiency costs are expressed as levelized costs over the life of the energy efficiency
options. The incremental costs (typically incurred in the first year of program
implementation) are spread over future years of the life of the energy efficiency measures.

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM investments (the avoided CO2 methodology). 10
Additional Benefits and Costs
Energy efficiency investments should reduce the bills of utility customers who make the
investments, but will probably not lead to absolute reductions in utility rates or bills for all
customers. However, cost-effective energy efficiency improvements should reduce overall utility
costs and average bills when compared to more expensive alternatives.

EEC-6. Promotion and Incentives for Improved Design and Construction
in the Private Sector

Policy Description
This policy option provides incentives and targets to induce the owners and developers of new
and reused (major retrofitted) residential and commercial buildings to improve the buildings'
efficiency for using energy and other resources, along with provisions for raising targets
periodically and providing resources to building industry professionals to help achieve the
desired building performance. This policy can include elements to encourage the improvement
and review of energy use goals over time, and to encourage flexibility in contracting
arrangements to encourage integrated energy- and resource-efficient design and construction.
Policy Design
Goals: Reduce energy consumption by the equivalent of 10% of retail electric sales and natural
gas in residential and commercial buildings. Additional savings beyond 10% result in larger CO2
reductions, as identified in the Additional Costs and Benefits section.
Timing: Compliance will begin on January 1, 2010.
Implementing Parties: Building industry professionals, architects.
Implementation Mechanisms
Incentives for improved building construction are offered by various utilities. Incentives offered
by IOUs are covered in the Types 2 and 3 incentives of EEC-5. Adoption of tax incentives or
other government-funded incentives would most likely require legislative action.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Iowa Building Code Commissioner has initiated a practice of updating the State Energy
Code every 3 years, as new editions of the IECC are published. In addition, annual revisions
have been and will continue to be made to the rules to improve enforcement.
During the 2008 session of the Iowa General Assembly, several pieces of legislation were
enacted that will encourage greater energy efficiency, including Senate File 517, which extended
the applicability of the State Energy Code, provides for the adoption of sustainable design
standards for the state by the Building Code Commissioner, and revises provisions related to the
Energy Bank administered by the Department of Natural Resources; and Senate File 2386, which
establishes a 2-year commission to study and report on ways to improve energy codes and their
enforcement in Iowa.
Iowa rate-regulated utilities have a long history of offering energy efficiency programs focusing
on new construction practices, under statutes adopted in 1990 and modified in 1996. Programs
have differentiated between the residential and nonresidential sectors. In this decade, the rateregulated utilities have increased their efforts to offer coordinated programs that provide similar
program design and program incentives in both sectors. The residential sector has seen multiF-28

option programs with both builder option and ENERGY STAR emphases. The nonresidential sector
has seen a multi-tiered approach focusing on design team assistance, design team incentives, and
owner incentives.
Additional potential elements of this option include:
•

Target new, renovated, and/or existing buildings (retrofits).

•

Set a cap on consumption of energy per unit area of floor space for new buildings.

•

Encourage building commissioning and recommissioning, including energy tracking and
benchmarking.

•

Set up a “feebate” program to encourage energy efficiency in building design.

•

Provide incentives, in the form of tax credits, DSM program support, financing incentives
(such as “green mortgages”), or other inducements for retrofitting existing residential and
commercial buildings.

•

Encourage the use of alternative and local building materials and practices.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural
gas to end users are reduced.

EEC-7. Training and Education for Builders and Contractors

Policy Description
This option refers to an education and outreach program for building professionals and code
enforcement officials to encourage incorporation of energy efficiency and GHG emission
reduction measures into construction. These programs can train designers, architects, builders,
contractors, and code officials on a variety of relevant energy efficiency issues, such as building
shell design, insulation, and proper heating and air conditioning sizing and installation, and can
be supported by licensing requirements for design and building trade professionals that address
knowledge of techniques for reducing energy use and sustainable design.
Policy Design
Goals: Implement training and education of design and building trade professionals to ensure
improvements in energy efficiency and conservation in new and existing buildings.
Timing: Training and education programs in place by 2010.
Implementing Parties: Departments of Public Safety and Natural Resources, Office for Energy
Independence, local code enforcement agencies; Iowa Association of Building Officials, AIA–
Iowa Chapter, Iowa Engineering Society, Iowa Building Trades Council, Master Builders of
Iowa, Associated Building Contractors, Iowa Center for Sustainable Communities; code-writing
bodies, including the International Code Council; organizations sponsoring and promoting
sustainable design, such as the U.S. Green Building Council; community colleges and
universities.
Implementation Mechanisms
The program will train designers, architects, builders, contractors, and code officials on a variety
of relevant energy efficiency issues, such as building shell design, insulation, and proper heating
and air conditioning sizing and installation, and can be supported by licensing requirements for
design and building trade professionals that address knowledge of techniques for reducing

EEC-8. Technology Improvements in Targeted Markets

Policy Description
This option includes energy efficiency programs, funds, or goals (such as improved
weatherization and appliances/HVAC) that focus on specific market segments at rental
properties and low-income residential units. Targeting specific market segments can also be an
effective component of a regional market transformation alliance.
Policy Design
Goals: Improvement in energy efficiency equal to 15% of retail sales.
Timing: Improvements realized beginning in 2010 at 1% per year for 3 years, then 1.5% for 4
years, then 2% per year until achieved.
Implementing Parties: Builders, contractors, landlords, and others TBD.
Implementation Mechanisms
None identified.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Since 1990, Iowa’s investor-owned electric and gas utilities have been mandated to have separate
low-income energy efficiency policies; before then, some companies had done so voluntarily.
Another market segment that has unique challenges is rental property (both residential and
commercial), where tenants pay energy bills but landlords maintain the facilities. Some policy
approaches for these important segments include:
•

Expanding Iowa’s Weatherization Assistance Program to make the homes of low-income
Iowans more energy-efficient.

•

Develop minimum efficiency goals for rental properties, such as use of compact fluorescent
light bulbs and energy-efficient appliances. Evaluate each unit with the departure of current
tenants via a pre-rental inspection program before a new tenant takes possession.

•

Provide financial mechanisms to assist with the retrofitting of rental properties with energyefficient appliances, insulation, and high-efficiency furnaces.

•

Establish a shared savings or zero-interest loan program to make energy-efficient appliances
affordable for everyone.

•

Design policies that allow paying for energy-efficient appliances over time on residential
utility bills.

Auction any emission allowances made available in a regional cap-and-trade system, and use the
proceeds for renewable energy and energy efficiency investments and assistance for low-income
families.

EEC-9. Midwestern Governors Association Energy Security
and Climate Stewardship Platform

Policy Description
Electricity use in Iowa has increased at 1.5% from 2000 to 2006; consequently, efficiency can
reduce any increase in demand. Natural gas increases have been greater than 2% recently.
In November 2007, Governor Culver signed on to the MGA Energy Security and Climate
Stewardship Platform. 13 This policy is designed to address the energy efficiency goal of meeting
at least 2% of the region’s annual retail sales of natural gas and electricity through energy
efficiency programs by 2015 and annually thereafter.
This policy option will require all of Iowa’s utilities—investor owned, municipal, and
cooperatives—to save at least 2% of their annual retail sales of natural gas and electricity
through energy efficiency programs by 2015 and annually thereafter.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Translate regional goal of at least 2% of the region’s annual retail sales of natural gas and
electricity through energy efficiency by 2015 and annually thereafter into an Iowa-specific
goal.
•

Reduce electricity consumption through efficiency measures every year after 2015.

Timing: See above.
Implementing Parties: All electric and gas suppliers, energy-related centers at the state Regents
institutions.
Implementation Mechanisms
Based on MGA accord and Iowa implementation statutes.

EEC-10. Energy Management Training/Building Operators

Policy Description
In many facilities, utility bills can be significantly decreased through more efficient equipment
and building operation. Administrative and technical training can inform and encourage energy
managers, school officials, building operators, and others responsible for facility energy
efficiency to utilize methods for minimizing unnecessary energy waste. This policy would
increase education and demonstrate the benefits of energy-efficient building operation through
government “leading by example” of energy service contracting.
Policy Design
Goals: Require energy managers and facility operators in all sectors to obtain certification for
successful completion of the training program.
Timing: Starting in 2010.
Implementing Parties: State and local entities, private energy managers, and facility operators
throughout the state.
Implementation Mechanisms
Specifically, this policy involves developing, implementing, and requiring a statewide energy
efficiency and conservation education and training program for energy managers and facility
operators to learn techniques for improving the efficiency of their steam, process heat, pumping,
compressed air, motors, and other systems. Successful completion of this training would be
required for energy managers and facility operators in all sectors (residential, commercial,
industrial, and institutional) by a licensing or certification requirement, which would need to be
established. Continuing education credits would be required annually.
A key organization in implementing energy efficiency training for building operators would be
the Building Owners and Managers Association.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Building Operator Certification (BOC) is a program component of the Custom Rebate DSM
program offered in partnership by the IOUs and the Midwest Energy Efficiency Alliance. As
described by the IOUs, BOC is a nationally recognized competency-based training and
certification program for operations and maintenance staff working in commercial, institutional,
or industrial buildings. BOC achieves energy savings by training individuals directly responsible
for maintenance of energy-using building equipment and day-to-day building operations.
Interstate Power and Light Company caps program impacts at a maximum of 10% of the
customer’s 12 months’ kilowatt-hour (kWh) and therm usage. IOU Building Operator program
reports average energy savings achieved by program participants as 0.18 kWh and 0.71 therms
per participant’s square foot of facility.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural
gas to end users are reduced.

Quantification Methods:

See EEC-12.

Key Assumptions:
• Building manager certification trains 5% of building operators in year 1 rising to 75% in
2020. (Subcommittee assumption)
•

Training program applies to heating, cooling, and ventilation energy use at commercial
buildings, which is 41% of energy use.

•

50% of commercial buildings (by square footage) have energy managers who are trained
under the program. The remaining 50% of commercial buildings do not receive benefits
under the program. The estimate is derived from square footage by principal building activity
from CBECS (2006a) data for the Midwest region. It assumes: (1) that all education,
mercantile, office, and service buildings have energy managers who would participate, and
(2) that the other building types, including warehouses, places of religious worship, and
F-42

health care facilities don’t have energy managers and, therefore, don’t participate. These two
stringent assumptions are likely to average each other out and provide a rough estimate for
likely coverage of the program.
•

Energy savings is equal to 10% of cooling load and 7.5% of heating and ventilation load,
which equates to 4% of net energy savings (ACEEE 2008).

•

Efficiency improvements result in differential efficiency gains for natural gas and electricity:
○

Assumes code or efficiency improvement affects gas and electricity according to fuel use.
○ Commercial: Electricity efficiency improvement of 1% results in 0.63% gas efficiency
improvement (CBECS 2006a).
•

The annual real escalation rate for cost of energy efficiency programs is 0%.

•

The value used for the real rate at which costs are discounted annually is 5%.

•

NPV is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

•

DSM/energy efficiency programs are assumed to displace marginal sources of generation
(50% coal, 50% gas) through 2012. From 2013 on, the programs are assumed to displace the
new-build mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% gas.

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM investments (the avoided CO2 methodology). 17
Additional Benefits and Costs
Energy efficiency investments should reduce the bills of utility customers who make the
investments, but will probably not lead to absolute reductions in utility rates or bills for all
customers. However, cost-effective energy efficiency improvements should reduce overall utility
costs and average bills when compared to more expensive alternatives.

EEC-11. Rate Structures

Policy Description
This policy option could include various elements of utility rate design that are geared toward
reducing GHG emissions, often with other benefits as well, such as reducing peak power
demand. The overall goal is to present rate structures so as to better reflect the actual economic
and environmental costs of producing and delivering electricity as those costs vary by time of
day, day of the week, season of the year, and from year to year. In this way, rates provide
consumers with information reflecting the impacts of their consumption choices.
The reduction of GHGs from changes in rate structures can come from two sources. The first is
the reduction of absolute levels of energy use by consumers due to higher prices. Real-time
pricing and smart metering give consumers information about their energy use that enables them
to better rationalize their use. Time-of-use pricing, or other schemes to reflect rational pricing
that result in price increases during peak periods, potentially reduces demand by the estimated
price elasticity of demand, typically by –0.20% to –0.50% (U.S. EIA 2003), so that a 10%
increase in prices would lead to a 2%– 5% reduction in demand. In a survey of experience with
smart metering, Owen and Ward (2006) found energy savings of 0%–10%.
The other source of GHG reductions from policies to reduce peak demand is energy efficiency
measures that reduce demand during peak periods, such as high-efficiency air conditioners and
chillers. These measures are included in the existing DSM measures in EEC-12 (DSM/energy
efficiency) and EEC-14 (appliance standards). These measures also reduce new generation
capacity investments, which are not quantified for GHG reductions because they are covered
under other policy options.
The GHG impacts of other types of rate structures are more difficult to quantify. Curtailment
programs that allow loads to be shifted during peak periods might result in different emission
profiles as these loads move from peak to shoulder or baseload periods. Overall CO2 savings
from these programs are also difficult to quantify; thus, they are not quantified for this policy.
Policy Design
Goals: Reduce electricity consumption through pricing by 2% of retail sales.
Timing: Compliance will begin on January 1, 2010.
Implementing Parties: All Iowa utilities and utility customers.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Programs for customers of IOUs are reviewed and authorized by the IUB in contested case
proceedings for the review of energy efficiency plans. Proceedings—labeled EEP (energy
efficiency plan) proceedings—are currently underway for the review of new (2009–2013)
EEPs. The current plans of IOUs include two types of rate programs: residential direct-loadcontrol programs and nonresidential interruptible programs.
F-44

•

The relationship of EEP proceedings to traditional rate proceedings for rate and revenue
design in programs besides direct-load-control and interruptible programs, such as those
listed in the Related Polices section below, has not been taken up in Iowa. The other rate
design options (beyond interruptible and direct-load-control), to the extent currently
available, have been implemented through general rate case proceedings. The IUB examines
rate-regulated utilities’ rate structures in rate proceedings to be sure that the rate structures in
place send the appropriate price signals.

•

Section 1252 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the Public Utilities Regulatory
Policies Act (PURPA) Standard 14, entitled “Time-Based Metering and Communications.”
Standard 14 directed the IUB to consider adopting four types of time-based rate schedules:
time-of-use pricing, critical peak pricing, real-time pricing, and load management programs.
The IUB declined to adopt PURPA Standard 14 in its entirety, finding that rate proceedings
are the appropriate forum for many of these issues (IUB Docket No. NOI-06-3, March 6,
2007). The IUB intends to begin informal discussions with interested participants regarding
these topics and potential pilot projects.

•

Programs for customers or members of municipal utilities and electric cooperatives are solely
at the discretion of each customer-owned utility. The IUB hopes the consumer-owned
utilities will be active in ongoing discussions and potential pilot programs to test other rate
design options beyond the well-established load management programs.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Rate-regulated utilities have employed two types of rate structures for many years and, in some
cases, for many decades:
•

Seasonal rates—These rates typically have higher prices in the season of the year when
demand and prices are the highest. In Iowa the higher season is typically a summer period of
3–4 months.

•

Time-of-day (TOD) rates—These rates typically price electricity higher at times of higher
power demand, based on either a two- or three-tiered time-differentiated structure, and thus
better reflect the actual cost of generation, transmission, and distribution. Time-of-use rates
may or may not have a significant impact on total GHG emissions, but do affect on-peak
power demand and, thus, both the need for peaking capacity and fuel for peaking plants.

Other possible policy mechanisms include several that have been offered on a much more limited
basis:
•

Critical peak pricing (CPP)—Also known as extreme-day pricing, CPP refers to programs
aiming to reduce system demand by encouraging customers to reduce their loads for a limited
number of hours during the year. CPP programs integrate a pricing structure similar to TOD,
with the distinction of more extreme pricing signals for the critical events. (A price structure
in which the extreme price is fixed by tariff reduces to a multi-tiered time-of-day rate.)

•

Real-time pricing—A tariff structure for customers to pay electric rates tied to market prices
for energy. The prices are typically posted by the utility based on day-ahead hourly prices,
but could be posted on a real-time basis.

F-45

•

Inverted block pricing—Also known as tiered/increasing peak, under this policy
mechanism rates for electricity and natural gas use include a rate for some base usage level
and increased rates for higher levels of consumption.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural
gas to end users are reduced.

F-46

Key Assumptions:
• Peak avoided costs and levelized costs are assumed to be the same as for EEC-12. A host of
measures could fall under this category, from smart meters to interruptible load programs.
These measures tend to have low capital costs; thus, using the levelized costs estimates from
Quantec (2008) is a conservative assumption.
•

The annual real escalation rate for cost of energy efficiency programs is 0%.

•

The value used for the real rate at which costs are discounted annually is 5%.

•

NPV is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

•

Demand-response measures are assumed to reduce electricity demand by 5%. This number is
a midpoint from the survey in which Owen and Ward (2006) found energy savings from
smart meters to vary by 0%–10%. This is consistent with what price elasticity of demand
would predict. If peak price tariffs are 10%–20% higher than nonpeak tariffs, then demand
reductions would range from 2.5% to 10% using price elasticities of –0.20% to –0.5%.

•

The installation of demand-response measures increases from 2% of total sales in the
beginning of the program to 40% by 2020 as the program gets implemented. Assuming a 5%
demand reduction and 40% participation, the program reaches the target of 2% of retail sales
by 2020.

•

The program applies only to peak load hours, which are assumed to be January–March and
April–September, 0700–2300 hours, for a total of 44% of total annual hours.

•

Residential, commercial, and industrial customers all implement the program at the same
rate.

•

Existing and planned (business-as-usual [BAU]) demand-response measures are 50% of the
total policy reductions (subcommittee assumption).

•

DSM/energy efficiency programs are assumed to displace marginal sources of generation
(50% coal, 50% gas) through 2012. From 2013 on, the programs are assumed to displace the
new-build mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% gas.

Key Uncertainties
There is uncertainty as to the benefits and costs of rate options and rate designs that are
dependent on utility-wide implementation of real-time metering (IUB Docket No. NOI-06-3).
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM investments (the avoided CO2 methodology). 18
Additional Benefits and Costs
Metering and associated infrastructure investments needed to support real-time pricing offer the
potential for additional cost savings to the utility.

EEC-12. Demand-Side Management (DSM)/ Energy Efficiency Programs
for Electricity

Policy Description
DSM/energy efficiency is a policy approach that requires actions that influence both the quantity
and the patterns of energy consumed by end users. This policy option focuses on DSM/energy
efficiency programs run by electric utilities, and may be designed to work in tandem with other
strategies that can also encourage efficiency gains.
Policy Design
Goals: Invest in energy efficiency equal to 1.0% of retail electricity sales per year within 3
years; 1.5% per year in 5 years; and 2.0% per year in 7 years.
Timing: Phase in, beginning in 2010.
Implementing Parties:
• Extend the DSM obligations and goals to all electric utilities in Iowa. IOUs are starting at
0.8% of retail sales; municipal utilities and rural electric cooperatives start at varying levels.
•

IOUs and the Iowa Utility Association, municipal utilities and the IAMU, electric
cooperatives and the Iowa Association of Electric Cooperatives.

Implementation Mechanisms
Possible policy mechanisms include:
•

Have the IUB establish DSM goals for investor-owned utilities.

•

Revise existing statutes to incorporate prescribed energy efficiency goals.

•

Change the determination of DSM cost-effectiveness by accounting for the estimated
valuation of CO2 emissions avoided by programs.

•

Extend the DSM obligations and goals to all to all electric utilities in Iowa.

•

Expand DSM measures eligible for program incentives.

•

Expand the scope of utility activity that can contribute to achieving DSM goals to include
actions that are on the utility side of the meter, so-called “infrastructure” investments.

•

Recognize the contribution of increased building energy codes and equipment energy
standards to the achievement of DSM goals.

•

Include in the measurement of DSM goals the energy savings from renewable measures that
are implemented on the customer side of the meter.

F-49

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Electric utilities in Iowa must offer cost-effective energy efficiency programs (Iowa Code §§
476.6(14)). The IUB establishes energy efficiency goals for IOUs (Iowa Code § 476.6(16)).
DSM offered by non-rate-regulated utilities is not regulated (Iowa Code § 476.6(16)).
Investor-Owned Electric Utilities
Iowa IOUs have a long history of conducting DSM/energy efficiency programs, under statutes
adopted in 1990 and modified in 1996. The IUB conducts contested proceedings for the review
of plans, programs, and energy saving goals developed by IOUs. New plans were filed in April
2008, and the IUB has directed the IOUs to include analyses of the effects of goals equivalent to
saving 1.5% of retail electric sales in Iowa.
Municipal and Cooperative Electric Utilities
Although the rural electric cooperatives and municipal electric utilities were required to file
biennial energy efficiency plans, and many have historically conducted DSM programs,
legislation passed in 2008 requires each utility or group of utilities to determine the maximum
potential energy and capacity savings available from actual and projected customer usage
through cost-effective energy efficiency measures and programs. Based on this assessment, each
utility must establish an energy efficiency goal and a set of cost-effective energy efficiency
programs designed to meet the energy efficiency goal.
The process must be started by July 1, 2008, with a progress report submitted to the IUB by
January 1, 2009, and a final report filed by January 1, 2010. The report must include the utility’s
cost-effective energy efficiency goal, and for each measure utilized by the utility in meeting the
goal, the measure’s description, projected cost, and the analysis of its cost-effectiveness. On
January 1 of each even-numbered year, commencing January 1, 2012, utilities must file a report
with the IUB identifying their progress in meeting the energy efficiency goal and any updates or
amendments to their energy efficiency plans and goals. This requirement will take the place of
the current energy efficiency plan filings.
IOU BAU electric efficiency investments equate to 0.8% of load in 2008. The assumed
incremental (new) statewide electric energy efficiency investments are equal to 0.69% of retail
sales over the planning period. Proposed energy efficiency plans, pending IUB determination,
would achieve 1.3%–1.5% of retail sales by 2012.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural
gas to end users are reduced.

Assuming incremental energy efficiency investments in Iowa remained unchanged from 2006
levels reported in IUB (2008), Iowa’s cumulative electric energy efficiency deployment would
be approximately 15% of sales in 2020. When using the levelized cost estimate assumptions
developed for the EEC sector, total utility and participant spending on energy efficiency/DSM in
the reference case is estimated at $270 million in 2020. Under EEC-12, additional energy
efficiency spending is estimated at $178 million in 2020, which achieves another cumulative
10% of sales.

•

To calculate projected energy consumption through 2030, growth factors were applied to the
historical 2005 data. The growth factors are based on a combination of two parameters:
○

One accounts for growth within the RCI sectors, with growth factors for the residential
sector based on projected population growth (from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Estimates Branch, and State Library of Iowa, State Data Center Program
[http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/State/stpopest19002007.xls] and State Library
of Iowa, State Data Center Program, "Iowa Census Data Tables: Projections"
http://data.iowadatacenter.org/browse/projections.html); growth in the commercial sector
based on non-manufacturing employment growth projections; and industrial-sector
growth based on manufacturing employment. Employment projections were taken from
Iowa Workforce Development, Labor Market and Economic Research Bureau, "Iowa
F-51

Statewide Projections (2004–2014)" (http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/pubs/statewide/
indprojstatewide.pdf).
○ The other factor is growth in electricity sales, which was calculated based on historical
retail sales from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, "Iowa
Electricity Profile," Table 8: Retail Sales, Revenue, and Average Retail Price by Sector,
1990 Through 2006. Available at: http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/
st_profiles/iowa.html.
Power Station Electricity Generation (GWh) and Fuel Use (BBtu)
• Gross generation for 2005 was obtained from the EIA database (EIA-906/920) on fuel stocks
at all electric power sector generating facilities, broken down by fuel type. (See U.S.
Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration. Form EIA-906: Power Plant
Report and Form EIA-920: Combined Heat and Power Plant Report. Available at:
http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/solar.renewables/page/state_profiles/rspt05ar.xls.)
•

Data for later years were projected from the 2005 figure based on projections of growth in
generation for the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP) region. The projected regional
consumption and generation data are from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information
Administration, "Supplemental Tables to the Annual Energy Outlook 2008," Data Tables 62–
91: Electricity Generation & Renewable Resource. Available at: http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/
aeo/supplement/index.html. On-site usage was subtracted from all generation figures.

Quantification Methods:
Heat Rates (Btu/kWh)
• Heat rates indicate how much fuel is used (Btu) to generate a given amount of electricity
(kWh). They vary greatly, depending on the type of power stations and the fuel used. Heat
rates are used to convert figures for electricity into figures for fuel use, so the fuel use can be
converted into GHG emissions using GHG emission factors. Heat rates for 2005 for each
type of generation and fuel were calculated from 2005 fuel use (in BBtu), divided by 2005
generation (GWh). Projections for 2006 and beyond are based on annual combustion
efficiency growth rates for the MAPP region. Combustion efficiency for a given year is
calculated for each fuel type as the fuel use (in quadrillion Btu) divided by the electricity
generated (in billion kWh), and the combustion efficiency growth rate applied to this value is
based on the change in combustion efficiency from the previous year.
GHG Emissions Associated With End-Use Consumption (by Sector)
• Historical CO2 data by sector (and further broken down by fuel type) were calculated by two
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT)
software modules: the Fossil Fuel Combustion Module and—for emissions from industrial
sources—the SIT module for industry. CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated by the
Stationary Combustion Module and—for emissions from industrial sources—the SIT module
for industry.
•

Projected emissions through 2030 were based on the 2005 data, with growth factors
compounded from year to year as discussed above for energy consumption.

F-52

GHG Emissions Associated With Electricity Generation From Different Technologies and Fuels
• The projected data for each GHG were calculated for each fuel and generation type (e.g.,
non-lignite coal in a steam plant) as a direct product of the projected generation data (in
GWh) described above. Metric tons (t) of CO2 are calculated from generation as:
tCO2 = GWh × (Btu/kWh) × (tCO2/MBtu) × (% of that fuel in the fuel mix)
where (Btu/kWh) is the heat rate and (tons CO2/MBtu) is the CO2 emission factor,
where MBtu is thousands of Btu
CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated similarly, and were then converted to CO2e using
global warming potentials of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O. The emission factors used for each
GHG were the same as those used in the EPA SIT software modules.
Key Assumptions:
• The levelized cost of energy efficiency measures is $37.13/megawatt-hour (MWh) (2008
dollars) in 2009. This figure includes all utility and participant costs. Utility fixed costs are

new-build mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% gas.

•

Energy efficiency costs are expressed as levelized costs over the life of the energy efficiency
options. The incremental costs (typically incurred in the first year of program
implementation) are spread over all future years of the life of the energy efficiency measures.

•

Statewide electricity energy efficiency programs are assumed to be 0.69% of retail sales over
the planning period.
F-53

•

IOU electric sales comprise approximately 76% of statewide electricity sales over the
planning period.

•

The value used for the real rate at which costs are discounted annually is 5%.

Key Uncertainties
Construction of new generation plants, while actively discussed in the state, is not certain. In
addition, some existing generation units are likely to be retired.
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM investments (the avoided CO2 methodology). 19 The
sensitivity analysis in Table F-12-2 indicates the outcomes of applying different assumptions
about avoided generation for EEC-12.

EEC-13. Government Lead by Example: Improved Design, Construction, and
Energy Operations in New and Existing State and Local Government Buildings

Policy Description
The state of Iowa and municipal and county governments and school districts can provide
leadership in energy efficiency by adopting policies that improve the energy efficiency of new
and renovated public buildings, and the equipment and appliances used therein. This policy
option provides targets to improve the efficiency of energy use in new and existing state and
local government buildings that are much higher than code standards.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Require that all new construction and major renovations of government-owned buildings,
including schools and publicly owned hospitals, meet sustainable design standards.
•

Starting in 2008, all new state buildings and major renovations will be designed to meet a
fossil fuel, GHG-emitting, energy consumption performance standard of 50% of the regional
average for that building type.

•

All state and local governments will require the procurement of energy-efficient equipment,
including lighting, office equipment, and other appliances, such as ENERGY STAR. (This goal
element is quantified under EEC-14.)

•

The fossil fuel reduction standard for all new buildings will be increased to:
○

60% in 2010
○ 70% in 2015
○ 80% in 2020
○ 90% in 2025
All state buildings will be carbon-neutral in 2030 (zero net energy, using no fossil fuel GHGemitting energy to operate).
Timing: See above.
Implementing Parties: State and local governments, the Capitol Planning organization, all three
Regents institutions, Iowa Association of Counties, League of Cities, Iowa Association of School
Boards, Iowa State Education Association, School Administrators of Iowa, private contractors,
Iowa State Building & Construction Trades Council.
Implementation Mechanisms
These goals can be met by a combination of demand-reduction measures, on-site carbon-neutral
generation, and grid-based green power purchases that exceed the amount of green power
purchases currently provided by the utility.

F-56

•

Require Sustainable Design Standards: Mandate that all new construction and major
renovations of government-owned buildings, including schools and publicly owned hospitals,
meet sustainable design standards, with increasingly more stringent requirements.

•

Collect Data on State and Local Government Building and Facilities Energy Use: A key
implementation mechanism for this option will be to first provide a thorough assessment of
the status and energy consumption of all existing state and local government buildings,
including establishing a database of buildings and building attributes, including floor area,
insulation level, energy-using equipment, and history of energy consumption. This baseline,
or “carbon footprint,” will be used to assess program success.

•

Benchmark State Buildings: Benchmarking is the process of using the data on building
size, use, and energy use to quickly compare a building against others of similar size and use
to determine how efficiently the building is operating. It is an important step in identifying
and prioritizing opportunities for energy savings.

•

Commission State Buildings: Building commissioning is a process of reviewing and tuning
up the operation of building systems and controls, much like tuning up a vehicle. Potential
targets for commissioning might include commissioning state buildings upon completion of
construction or renovation, and whenever the energy use in a building shows an unexpected
and unexplained increase in energy use.

•

Purchase Green Power: Iowa should enter into agreements to purchase green power for a
portion of the state's electricity needs, as laid out in Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack’s April 2005
Executive Order #41 on Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, 20 and Iowa Gov. Chet
Culver’s February 2008 Executive Order #6 on the same topic. 21 The state should increase
purchases over time, until 30% of power needs are met through direct use of renewable
energy or green power purchased by 2030.

•

Set Energy Use Targets: Targets for energy use in the operation of state buildings might
include capping state and local buildings' and facilities' energy use per square foot. Motion
sensors, which are a specific technology for reducing lighting energy use in government
buildings, may have broad application.

•

Renovate State and Local Buildings and Facilities Through a Buildings and Facilities
Energy Program: Within 5 years, the state should renovate all state and local buildings and
facilities with more than 5,000 square feet, and smaller buildings identified through an
energy benchmark process as having a high potential for energy savings. State and local
buildings and facilities energy programs will provide funds for energy audits, engineering
analyses, and renovation costs.

•

Develop and Use Renewable Energy Resources: The state should evaluate the potential for
direct use of solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydropower to meet the needs of state
government operations, and should invest in these renewable resources whenever they are
practical and cost-effective, and use them as a means to lead by example.

•

Require Carbon-Neutral Bonding: Climate-neutral bonding will require that any building
projects financed with the issuance of state, county, or local/municipal bonds result in no net
increase in GHG emissions. If a new construction project is expected to increase emissions,
there must be GHG emission reductions to offset the increase within the state or particular
jurisdiction. Offsets could include on-site renewable energy development, renewable energy
purchases, energy efficiency (in existing state buildings), carbon sequestration (tree
planting), and switching to cleaner or renewable fuels. Any GHGs emitted after the bondfinanced project becomes operational will be required to be offset. The new buildings could
also offset their emissions by purchasing renewable electricity from their local utility. Paying
a premium for what’s known as “green pricing” electricity will usually be a more expensive
offset option than energy efficiency. A community or state could install its own renewable
energy project as a way to offset its GHG emissions.

•

Conduct Monitoring and Verification: Building energy use will need to be reviewed
periodically.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
See Governor Culver’s Executive Order #6, which requires state buildings to reduce energy use
by 15% by 2015. 22 Elements of this policy include:
•

Government buildings, facilities, and related operations (including wastewater and water
utilities) will be in operation for many years and should be designed in a manner that meets
or exceeds private-sector-mandated building and trade energy efficiency. When life-cycle
cost are considered, the discount rate should be smaller and the assumptions of future energy
prices should be higher than those commonly considered in the private sector, so that the
state may be seen as a leader in energy efficiency and workforce efficiency. All new state
buildings and facilities, and renovations and additions must meet sustainable design
standards established by the Building Code Commissioner at increasingly stringent levels
over time, and must meet or exceed the energy efficiency and renewable energy goals stated
in the order.

•

Existing state and local government buildings must be retrofitted for energy efficiency
achieving 100% of cost-effective energy efficiency by 2015. To meet this goal, the state and
local governments must benchmark all buildings and facilities within the next 3 years.

•

Energy performance and operations of state and other government buildings must be audited
(in tandem with an audit program). Audit results could be used to target and prioritize
investments in improving government building energy efficiency.

•

Efficiency goals must be improved and reviewed over time, and contracting arrangements
must be made more flexible to encourage integrated energy-efficient design and construction.

•

The implementation infrastructure (meters, accounting systems, staff, etc.) should be
established as soon as possible.

•

“Retained savings” policies should be established that enable government agencies to retain
funds saved by reducing energy bills and use the funds for further investment in energy
efficiency/renewable energy measures or other uses.

•

Carbon-neutral bonding is required for new construction and for renovations and additions. A
carbon-neutral performance standard will require architects and engineers to design and build
buildings that meet a climate-neutral requirement, meet or exceed the state’s existing
sustainable building guidelines, and save the taxpayers money as life-cycle costs will yield
lower operational costs.

•

Incentives should focus on specific technologies, including white roofs, rooftop gardens, and
landscaping to lower electricity demand, and solar photovoltaics to provide electricity when
demand is highest.

Potential supporting measures for this option include training and certification of building-sector
professionals, but could also include surveys of government energy and water use, energy
benchmarking, measurement, and tracking programs for municipal and state buildings.
Executive Order #41 (Governor Vilsack) requires that all state agencies reduce energy
consumption per square foot per degree-day in all conditioned facilities (buildings) by an
average of 15% by 2010 relative to 2000 levels. 23

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural
gas to end users are reduced.

• Heat rates (Btu/kWh). See EEC-12.
•

GHG emissions associated with end-use consumption (by sector). See EEC-12.

•

GHG emissions associated with electricity generation from different technologies and fuels.
See EEC-12.

Key Assumptions:
• The reduction in GHGs from state buildings begins in 2008, with new buildings or major
renovations emitting 50% less GHGs than older construction. Then emissions are reduced by

F-60

60% in 2010, 70% in 2015, 80% in 2020, and 90% in 2025. The reductions in each year are
calculated relative to the BAU baseline.
•

New government space grows at 1.2% per year.

•

Compliance with this policy is assumed to be 50% at the start of the program and rises to
75% by 2020 under the new compliance regime. For the portion of the new buildings (or
retrofits) that don’t comply, energy use in these structures is assumed to be 20% higher than
the policy level.

•

Building energy consumption is a function of Iowa’s climate. According to the amount of
HDD and CDD, Iowa is in the Residential Energy Consumption Survey climate zone 2
(RECS 2001).

•

New commercial buildings in climate zone 2 have higher electric intensity relative to existing
stock, so are adjusted upward by 24% (CBECS).

•

This policy covers 74% of all electricity use. (Government appliances are covered under
EEC-14.)

•

Efficiency improvements result in differential efficiency gains for natural gas and electricity:
○

Assumes code or efficiency improvement affects gas and electricity according to fuel use.
○ Commercial/Government: Electricity efficiency improvement of 1% results in 0.63% gas
improvement (CBECS 2006a).
•

State and local governments consume 16.9% of all commercial electricity (CBECS 2006b).

•

T&D losses for electricity are 7%.

•

Wind and biomass are the types of renewable energy resources purchased by governments to
meet the fossil fuel reduction targets, given their relevant abundance in Iowa. Purchases of
renewables are assumed to be 80% wind and 20% biomass.

•

Renewable electricity costs for wind and biomass in the analysis come from the levelized
costs developed by the CRE SC.

•

DSM/energy efficiency programs are assumed to displace marginal sources of generation
(50% coal, 50% gas) through 2012. From 2013 on, the programs are assumed to displace the
new-build mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% gas.

•

The annual real escalation rate for cost of energy efficiency programs is 0%.

•

The value used for the real rate at which costs are discounted annually is 5%.

•

NPV is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to

EEC-14. More Stringent Appliance Efficiency Standards

Policy Description
Appliance efficiency standards reduce the market cost of energy efficiency improvements by
incorporating technological advances into base appliance models, thereby creating economies of
scale. Appliance efficiency standards can be implemented at the state level for appliances not
covered by federal standards, or standards can be jointly developed by multiple states.
Policy Design
Goals: Achieve 5% reduction in energy consumption from residential, commercial, and
industrial consumers via:
•

80% minimum efficiency standards by 2010 for appliances not covered by federal standards,
as recommended by the Appliance Standards Awareness Project and the American Council
for an Energy-Efficient Economy. 25

•

100% market penetration of ENERGY STAR appliances in purchase transactions in which state
funds are involved (state purchasing contracts, state grants or loans, etc.) by 2012.

•

A doubling of market penetration of ENERGY STAR appliances in purchases made in the
residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, where applicable, up to 100% by 2017.

Timing: As noted above.
Implementing Parties: As noted above.
Implementation Mechanisms
To ensure that appliances purchased in the state will maximize the cost-effective potential for
energy efficiency and minimize GHG emissions, the following policy prescriptions should be
considered:
•

Create incentives for improving standards for appliances not regulated by federal standards,
and consider working with other states to do so.

•

More stringent appliance standards at the federal level. Require the preferential procurement
of ENERGY STAR products if available (equipment, appliance, or technology), if state funds
are involved (state purchasing contracts, state grants or loans, etc.).

25

See Appliance Standards Awareness Project and American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Energy
Efficiency Standards Benefits—2006 Model Bill. Available at: http://www.standardsasap.org/documents/
a062_sc.pdf. The analysis recommends standards for the following products: bottle-type water dispensers;
commercial boilers; commercial hot-food-holding containers; compact audio products; DVD players and recorders;
liquid-immersion distribution transformers; medium-voltage, dry-type distribution transformers; metal halide lamp
fixtures; pool heaters; portable electric spas; residential furnaces and boilers; residential pool pumps; single-voltage
external AC-to-DC power supplies; state-regulated incandescent reflector lamps; and walk-in refrigerators and
freezers.
F-63

•

State sales tax exemptions, whether temporary or permanent, for ENERGY STAR-certified
products.

•

State income tax credits to reduce the incremental cost of ENERGY STAR appliances relative
to standard appliances.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
There are existing federal standards for 17 residential products and 11 pieces of commercial
equipment. Laws require the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to set minimum appliance
efficiency standards that are technologically feasible and economically justified. However, state
standards can play a role for many appliances not covered by federal standards.
ENERGY STAR is a joint EPA/DOE program designed to promote energy-efficient products in the
marketplace. ENERGY STAR products and appliances surpass the minimum federal and state
energy efficiency standards.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions. For direct fuel use, CO2
from natural gas combustion and likely very small amounts of CH4 from the transport of natural
gas to end users are reduced.

Key Assumptions:
• DSM/energy efficiency programs are assumed to displace marginal sources of generation
(50% coal, 50% gas) through 2012. From 2013 on, the programs are assumed to displace the
new-build mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% gas.
•

Improved appliance standards begin to take effect in 2010, with full implementation by 2017.
The energy reduction due to improved appliance efficiency is calculated relative to the BAU
baseline. For Iowa government operations, the assumed BAU penetration rate of ENERGY
STAR appliances is 75% between 2010 and 2012. For the residential, commercial, and
industrial sectors, the assumed BAU penetration rate is 50% in 2010 and rises to 75% in
F-65

2017. This is consistent with the 2005 penetration rates for various ENERGY STAR products in
Nexus Market Research (2006).
•

ENERGY STAR appliances are 30% more efficient than other appliance choices. There are
some discrepancies about the relative efficiency of ENERGY STAR products. Webber et al.
(2002) show efficiency gains ranging from 7% to 90%, but a recent Consumer Reports
(2008) article highlights some of the problems with this voluntary program, which has a
third-party verification system and sets efficiency benchmarks for products to qualify that are
not realistic with everyday use. The 30% efficiency improvement is a rough estimate, given
the uncertainties about the product brand.

•

39% of electricity is consumed by appliances in residential buildings, which assumes that
refrigerators and one-half of other appliances and lighting apply to this option (RECS 2001).

•

26% of electricity is consumed by appliances (office equipment) in government and
commercial buildings (CBECS 2006c).

•

8% of electricity is consumed by appliances in industrial buildings, which assumes one-half
of HVAC and facilities support are covered by ENERGY STAR appliances, such as heat pumps
and furnaces (MECS 2005).

•

Appliance efficiency improvements result in differential efficiency gains for natural gas and
electricity.
○

Residential: Electricity improvement of 1% results in 2.23% gas improvement (RECS
2001).
○ Commercial: Electricity improvement of 1% results in 0.63% gas improvement
(CBECS).
○ Industrial: Electricity improvement of 1% results in 0.84% gas improvement. Source:
Gas facility support divided by electricity facility support (in BBtu) in MECS 2005.
•

The levelized cost (2005$) of appliance efficiency standards is $11.90/MWh and $3.49/BBtu
(WGA 2005). Natural gas cost/BBtu is equivalent to MWh cost at the rate of 1
GWh/3.41BBtu. [Is this correct?]

•

EISA developed standards, or instructed DOE to develop standards, for many of the products
in the Appliance Standards Awareness Project (ASAP) 2006 model bill. EEC-14 applies
only to the following products: bottle-type water dispensers, commercial hot-food-holding
cabinets, hot tubs, residential furnace fuel efficiency (from 82% in the EISA to 90% annual
fuel utilization efficiency [AFUE] in the ASAP model bill), pool heaters, and commercial
boilers. GWh and BBtu reductions are from ASAP 2006.

•

The annual real escalation rate for cost of energy efficiency programs is 0%.

•

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM investments (the avoided CO2 methodology). 26
Additional Benefits and Costs
Energy efficiency investments should reduce the bills of utility customers who make the
investments, but will probably not lead to absolute reductions in utility rates or bills for all
customers. However, cost-effective energy efficiency improvements should reduce overall utility
costs and average bills when compared to more expensive alternatives.

The Annex to this document defines the rationale behind the assumption used for the avoided CO2 methodology in
these analyses and provides several scenarios for the impacts of different mixes of avoided generation technologies.
F-67

Annex A
Avoided Electricity Emissions for the Residential, Commercial, and
Industrial Sectors
To estimate emission reductions from policy options that are expected to displace conventional
grid-supplied electricity (i.e., energy efficiency and conservation) a simple, straightforward
approach is used. Through 2012, we assume that these policy options would displace generation
from a “marginal” mix of fuel-based electricity sources of 50% coal and 50% gas. (We assume
that sources without significant fuel costs would not be displaced—e.g., hydro or other
renewable generation.) After 2012, we assume that the policy options are likely to avoid a mix of
new-build capacity additions. The new-build mix for the RCI sector is estimated to be 78% coal,
21% renewables, and 1% gas. This mix is what is proposed to be built as part of the
Marshalltown (Sutherland) coal plant package, which includes wind generation and biomass cofiring requirements, as well as additional wind resources that the CRE SC perceived as being
likely to be built as part of the reference case forecast.
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased energy efficiency and DSM. Table F-A-1 provides several scenarios for avoided
generation mixes. The scenarios differ in that each scenario that includes less coal or more gas
results in about 10% fewer tCO2 reductions.
Recall that the NPV of options for the EEC sector is the difference between avoided costs and
the levelized costs of the investments, and is unaffected by the CO2 methodology. The changes
in the $/ton (the last column of the table) are due to changes in total tons of CO2 mitigated
between the scenarios. The cost savings increase as CO2 reductions decrease because the total
cost savings number is constant, but is being spread out among fewer tons of CO2. Table F-A-1
represents three different ways to look at what could happen under different scenarios. Note
the 10% decrease in cumulative CO2 reductions from scenario to scenario.

The reference approach described in the beginning of this annex provides a transparent way to
estimate emission reductions and to avoid double counting (by ensuring that the same MWh
from a fossil fuel source are not “avoided” more than once). The reference approach can be
considered a “first-order” approach; it does not attempt to capture a number of factors, such as
the distinction between peak, intermediate, and baseload generation; issues in system dispatch
and control; impacts of nondispatchable and intermittent sources, such as wind and solar; or the
dynamics of regional electricity markets. These relationships are complex and could mean that
policy options affect generation and emissions (as well as costs) in a manner somewhat different
from that estimated here. Nonetheless, this approach provides reasonable first-order
approximations of emission impacts and offers the advantages of simplicity and transparency
that are important for stakeholder processes.
Existing Energy Efficiency Actions In Iowa
IOU BAU incremental (new) electric efficiency investments equate to 0.8% of load in 2008. The
assumed incremental statewide electric energy efficiency investments are equal to 0.69% of
retail sales over the planning period (2009–2020). For natural gas, the assumed incremental
statewide natural gas energy efficiency investments are equal to 0.82% of retail sales. These
reductions are subtracted from EEC-12 and EEC-2, respectively.
Proposed energy efficiency plans, pending IUB determination, would achieve between 1.3% and
1.5% of retail sales by 2012. These proposals are not included in the analyses, as they have not
been approved yet. Their inclusion would have simply changed the accounting for reductions
from the policy options (e.g., EEC-12) to the recent actions line in the summary table at the
beginning of this appendix.
The state government is also taking aggressive actions to reduce energy use. For example,
Governor Culver’s Executive Order #6 requires state buildings to reduce energy use by 15% by
2015, 27 and Governor Vilsack's Executive Order #41 requires that all state agencies reduce
energy consumption per square foot per degree-day in all conditioned facilities (buildings) by an
average of 15% by 2010 relative to 2000 levels. 28 The combined effects of these executive
orders are shown in the recent actions line in the summary table. The calculations show that
these orders save approximately 315 GWh of electricity and 680 BBtu of natural gas by 2015
with an accompanying GHG reduction of 0.29 MMtCO2e in 2015.

Draft Overlap Discussion
The amount of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) emissions reduced in the policy options within
the Energy Supply (ES) sector overlaps with some of the quantified benefits and costs of other
policy options within the ES sector and in other sectors. Those overlaps were identified and
adjusted to eliminate double counting. If a policy’s impact by type of energy supplied was less
than the impact from an overlapping policy for the same type of energy supplied, then it was
excluded from the cumulative analysis. The ES sector totals were reduced accordingly, as shown
in the summary table above.
The following text overview identifies specifically where those overlaps occurred and how they
were resolved under the Clean and Renewable Energy (CRE) proposed policies:
CRE-2 (Renewables Technologies Initiative)—This option addresses actions that promote the
use of renewable energy sources, while CRE-5 (Generation Performance Standard) and CRE-8
(Renewables Targets) are proposed as regulatory requirements for electric utilities and
nonutilities. It is likely that the electricity generated by the new renewable energy sources that
are developed pursuant to CRE-2 will be purchased by the large power producers that are
required to comply with the clean energy targets of CRE-5. Therefore, the reductions of CRE-5
are subtracted from CRE-2.
CRE-5 (Generation Performance Standards)—A generation performance standard is a
requirement that generators follow to reduce the CO2 intensity of their generation portfolio,
while providing regulatory flexibility in the compliance pathway. In the short term, a
performance standard can reduce the incentives for new fossil fuel generation with high CO2
intensity. In the long term, the generation portfolio can be considered similar to a renewable
portfolio standard, but with a larger basket of compliance options. The renewable energy
generated from this policy is assumed to overlap with CRE-2.
CRE-8 (Renewables Targets)—The renewables targets under this option are similar, but less
aggressive than what is forecasted to occur under CRE-5. Similar generation mixes are expected
under either approach. For that reason, CRE-8 is considered redundant to CRE-5, and electricity
generation and associated CO2 reductions from this option are eliminated through the overlap
analysis.
CRE-13 (Pricing Strategies)—This option promotes the use of net metering to deploy clean
energy technologies at the point of customer use. For renewables, there is very little overlap with
other CRE policy options because the other options promote the deployment of large-scale
renewable energy projects, like wind farms and co-firing biomass in pulverized coal boilers,
while this option sites small-scale renewables. However, the combined heat and power (CHP)
element of this option could overlap with CRE-12 (Combined Heat and Power) for industrial or
commercial customers who might site microturbines or other CHP technologies at the point of
use. For this reason, the electricity generation and associated CO2 reductions from this option are
reduced by 50%.

G-2

Overlaps With Other Sectors
The increased use of renewable energy from governments in Energy Efficiency and
Conservation (EEC) policy option EEC-13 (Government Lead by Example) is not expected to
overlap with CRE policies. EEC-13 has a goal of increasing renewable power generation among
government end users. Voluntary green power purchasing typically does not count toward utility
renewable portfolio standards, such as CRE-8b the Midwestern Governors Association (MGA)
renewables target.
CRE-4 (Decarbonization Fund)—This policy option is a mechanism to fund renewable energy
and energy efficiency, along with low-income weatherization and clean energy research and
development (R&D). The renewables that are assumed to be deployed under the quantification of
this option are expected to be redundant to CRE-8b (MGA renewable energy goals), and CO2
reductions from this option are eliminated through the overlap analysis. The energy efficiency
deployment that results from this option is expected to be completely redundant to energy
efficiency under EEC-1.
CRE-2 also overlaps with Agriculture, Forestry, and Waste Management (AFW) policy options
AFW-3 and AFW-9. The reductions from the AFW sector are assumed to completely overlap
with CRE-2, and are subsumed under the CRE option.
The electricity energy efficiency investments from the suite of EEC policy options reduce
electricity demand and thus make it possible to meet renewable energy mandates more costeffectively. For example, under EEC-12, electricity demand in 2020 is reduced by almost 5,000
gigawatt-hours (GWh) versus the reference case. CRE-8b assumes a 20% goal by 2020, which is
4% more renewables (as a percentage of retail sales) than is forecasted under the reference case.
Therefore, the implementation of EEC-12 would require 200 GWh fewer of renewable resources
to meet the goal. Using the renewable energy cost assumptions for CRE-8b, the reduced
spending on renewables that cost more than reference case generation in 2020 would result in
savings of $.3 million in that year.
Finally, an additional feedback is that certain CRE policies will have the effect of reducing the
GHG emissions associated with energy production, so that EEC policies that target electricity
use will have a reduced impact on overall emissions. However, this impact is small and has not
been reflected in the analysis beyond the avoided CO2 methodology that assumes in the later
years of the program that 21% new renewables are avoided by implementing the EEC options.
(The CRE methodology does not include avoided renewables, because doing so would contradict
the goals of the CRE options.) See Annex A for a discussion of the avoided CO2 methodology.

G-3

CRE-1. Education

Policy Description
This option is directed at education and outreach for the purposes of nurturing public
consciousness of climate change issues, as well as providing technical skills training for
employment in positions that directly support greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction
activities.
Broad awareness engages citizens of all ages to take direct action to reduce GHG emissions
through personal and public means. It also builds grass-root support for government, industrial,
and civil society actions with regard to GHG emission reduction programs, policies, or goals.
Technical instruction and training of citizens will provide the number of skilled employees
needed to fill critical jobs in the new and growing industries that will provide emission
reductions and clean energy.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy option are qualitative. They focus on developing, implementing,
and executing a statewide climate change control awareness education and job-training program
that:
•

Provides a platform that, along with imparting knowledge, encourages a bias for action on
the part of all Iowans.

•

Provides a specified environmental education curriculum to primary, secondary, and postsecondary audiences within the state.

•

Provides continuous public exposure through a variety of communications channels to
educate and enhance the awareness of Iowans about environmental issues.

•

Provides technical job training in support of the growing need by Iowa’s renewable energy
industries for skilled workers.

•

Develops statewide environmental literacy. The outcome of a successful environmental
education program is one in which the learner progresses to deeper knowledge, can apply it
to address complex environmental issues, and makes wiser decisions based on that
knowledge.

Timing: Begins with the 2010 academic year.
Implementing Parties: Elementary and secondary school districts, municipal governments, the
three regents state universities, Iowa community colleges, community partners/associations.
Other: None identified.

CRE-2. Technology Initiatives, Including Renewables

Policy Description
This policy option deals with the implementation of clean and renewable energy technologies
that are currently commercially available, and their potential for implementation in Iowa. States
can undertake initiatives focused on developing, promoting, and/or implementing one or more
specific technologies that show promise for reducing GHG emissions. Technologies could
include (among others) wind, biomass (including refuse-derived fuels), landfill gas to energy,
hydropower, solar, and geothermal. This policy would support providing state government and
other private and public parties with resources and incentives for analysis, targeted research and
development (R&D), market development, and adoption of GHG-reducing technologies that are
not covered by other CRE policies.
Policy Design
In 2008, the Iowa Legislature passed and the Governor signed a law that required the Iowa
Utility Association, in consultation with the Iowa Association of Electric Cooperatives and the
Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities, to conduct a technical study of the potential for costeffective renewable energy generation by 2025. The study will be transmitted to the Iowa Office
of Energy Independence by December 1, 2008, and included in the Iowa Energy Independence
Plan required to be submitted to the Office of the Governor and the General Assembly by
December 14, 2008.
Goals: Increase Iowa renewable electric production:
•

From landfill gas-to-energy projects by 9,000 megawatt-hours (MWh) annually until the
maximum feasible generation of approximately 90,000 MWh per year is developed.

•

From waste-to-energy projects by 65,500 MWh annually until the maximum feasible
generation of approximately 655,000 MWh per year is developed.

•

From wind projects by up to 2.6 million MWh annually or until the feasible amount of wind
generation that can be integrated into the grid is reached.

•

From co-firing biomass agricultural residues in existing pulverized coal boilers at a rate of
10% of coal generation, or approximately 3,600 MWh annually.

•

From biomass generation from dedicated energy crops up to 760,000 MWh annually until the
maximum feasible generation is developed.

•

From repowering hydroelectric facilities by up to 112,000 MWh annually until the maximum
feasible generation is developed.

Initial specific targets for additional technologies listed in the policy description (such as wind) are
to be determined upon review of best available data to characterize the maximum cost-effective
potential of each of the major technology options until the study mentioned above is completed.
Timing: Beginning in 2011, continuing through 2020.

G-8

Implementing Parties: State government, private and public partners on a voluntary basis.
Implementation Mechanisms
Biomass co-firing can be a low-cost, near-term means of converting biomass to electricity and
displacing coal use by adding up to 15% biomass in high-efficiency coal boilers. Biomass energy
conversion factors and crop yield estimates will be used to determine the number of farm acres
needed to reach specific percentage and MWh goals.
A standard interconnection rule will ensure that distributed power products meet minimum
requirements for performance, safety, and maintenance and will significantly advance the
commercialization of these new technologies. Standardized interconnection rules, which are
generally developed and administered by a state’s public utility commission, establish clear and
uniform processes and technical requirements for connecting distributed generation (DG) systems
to the electric utility grid. Interconnection standards will reduce barriers to connection of DG
systems to the grid identified by other policy options. Connecting to the grid enables the facility to:
(1) purchase power from the grid to supply supplemental power as needed, for example, during
periods of planned system maintenance; (2) sell excess power to the utility; and (3) maintain grid
frequency and voltage stability, as well as utility worker safety. This topic is of particular interest,
as the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005) directs states to consider upgrading their standards
for interconnecting small generators within 1 year of enactment.2

Energy Consumption by Sector (Billions of British Thermal Units [BBtu])
• Historical energy consumption in the state, by sector, is from the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) Energy Information Administration (EIA) State Energy Data System, available at
http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/states/_seds.html. To calculate future projected energy
consumption, growth factors were applied to the historical 2005 data to calculate projections
through 2030. The growth factors are based on a combination of two parameters.
○

One accounts for growth within the RCI sectors, with growth factors for the residential
sector based on projected population growth (from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Population
Estimates Branch, and State Library of Iowa, State Data Center Program
[http://data.iowadatacenter.org/datatables/State/stpopest19002007.xls] and State Library
of Iowa, State Data Center Program, "Iowa Census Data Tables: Projections"

based on non-manufacturing employment growth projections; and industrial-sector
growth based on manufacturing employment. Employment projections were taken from
Iowa Workforce Development, Labor Market and Economic Research Bureau, "Iowa
Statewide Projections (2004–2014)" (http://iwin.iwd.state.ia.us/pubs/statewide/
indprojstatewide.pdf).

The other factor is growth in electricity sales, which was calculated based on historical
retail sales from U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, "Iowa

Quantification Methods:
Heat Rates (Btu/kWh)
• Heat rates indicate how much fuel is used (British thermal units [Btu]) to generate a given
amount of electricity (kilowatt-hour [kWh]), and they vary greatly depending on the type of
power stations and the fuel used. Heat rates are used to convert figures for electricity into
figures for fuel use so the fuel use can be converted into GHG emissions using GHG
emission factors. Heat rates for 2005 for each type of generation and fuel were calculated
from 2005 fuel use (in BBtu) divided by 2005 generation (GWh). Projections for 2006 and
beyond are based on annual combustion efficiency growth rates for the MAPP region.
Combustion efficiency for a given year is calculated for each fuel type as the fuel use (in
quadrillion Btu) divided by the electricity generated (in billion kWh), and the combustion
efficiency growth rate applied to this value is based on the change in combustion efficiency
from the previous year.

G-11

GHG Emissions Associated With End-Use Consumption (by Sector)
• Historical CO2 data by sector (and further broken down by fuel type) were calculated by two
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) State Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (SIT)
software modules: the Fossil Fuel Combustion Module and—for emissions from industrial
sources—the SIT module for industry. CH4 and N2O emissions were calculated by the
Stationary Combustion Module and—for emissions from industrial sources—the SIT module
for industry.
•

Projected emissions through 2030 were based on the 2005 data, with growth factors
compounded from year to year, as discussed above under Energy Consumption by Sector.

GHG Emissions Associated With Electricity Generation From Different Technologies and Fuels
• The projected data for each GHG were calculated for each fuel and generation type (e.g.,
nonlignite coal in a steam plant) as a direct product of the projected generation data (in
GWh), described above under Power Station Electricity Generation and Fuel Use. Metric
tons (t) of CO2 are calculated from generation as:
tCO2 = GWh × (Btu/kWh) × (tCO2/MMBtu) × (% of that fuel in the fuel mix)

where (Btu/kWh) is the heat rate and (tCO2/MMBtu) is the CO2 emission factor. Calculations
for CH4 and N2O are similar, =, which are then converted to CO2 equivalents (CO2e) using
global warming potentials of 21 for CH4 and 310 for N2O. The emission factors used for each
GHG were the same as those used in the EPA SIT software modules.
Key Assumptions:
• Renewables include landfill gas, waste-to-energy, wind, hydro repowering, 10% biomass cofiring, and biomass energy crops.
•

The capacity factor for wind is 36%, which is the DOE 2015 class 3 capacity factor.

•

Iowa Energy Center’s Wind Maps show nearly all of the state at or above an annual Class
3 wind resource (http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/wind/maps/annual.htm).
The rate at which costs are discounted annually is 5%.

•

Net present value (NPV) is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

•

All electricity from coal-fired generation is coming from sources within Iowa (no imports).

•

Renewables displace marginal sources of generation (50% coal, 50% natural gas) through
2012. From 2013 on, renewables displace the thermal new-build mix of 99% coal, 1%
natural gas.

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased renewables (the avoided CO2 methodology).3

CRE-3. MGA Cap-and-Trade, Including Offsets To Promote Renewable Energy

Policy Description
A cap-and-trade system is a constructed market-based compliance mechanism in which GHG
emissions are limited to a specified amount (i.e., the cap), and entities subject to the cap can buy
and sell (i.e., trade) emission allowances. In theory, a properly designed cap-and-trade system of
sufficient market size can lower the cost of compliance of meeting the emissions cap to all
entities involved. This is possible because participants with a lower cost of compliance can
reduce emissions below their allocation and sell their additional allowances to a participant with
a cost of compliance that is otherwise higher than the market allowance price.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy are assumed to be those adopted by the MGA cap-and-trade
program. The ICCAC should revisit what action to take on this option once the MGA cap levels
and model rule have been developed.
Timing: The policy would start in concert with other MGA actions.
Parties Involved: All sectors of the economy must be covered to ensure actual emission
reductions. The electric generating sector is likely to cover all units emitting 10,000 tons of CO2
or more per year. This policy would require adoption of a regional cap-and-trade system by the
Iowa Legislature, and implementation by appropriate federal and state government agencies.
Implementation Mechanisms
Many variables can be incorporated into a cap-and-trade system, including the GHGs and sectors
covered, upstream or downstream coverage, banking, safety valve prices, tie-ins with regional or
international trading systems, offsets, early action credits, technology incentives, auctioning, triggers
for on and off ramps, and the glide path of the cap. Each factor can have a significant influence on
the market price of allowances, and thus the cost of compliance and impacts on ratepayers.
To encourage the development of biomass-based renewable energy, CO2 emissions from the
combustion of biomass (e.g., switchgrass, corn stover) or methane from the decomposition of
organic matter (e.g., landfill gas, manure biogas) would not count against the cap.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
A possible federal cap and trade program could take the following steps:
•

Realistically, the cap-and-trade program will need to follow a slow-stop-reverse glide path.
An immediate or abrupt reversal of the current emissions growth path is unrealistic, given
current technology options, and is more likely to cause undue economic hardship.

•

In general, the larger the scope of a cap-and-trade program, the more likely the odds of
lowering the cost of compliance for all participants. Thus, a federal cap-and-trade program is
recommended as the first choice. A regional cap-and-trade program, such as the MGA

G-14

Accord, is the second-best choice and is also the minimum size recommended for a cap-andtrade program. A state-level program is not likely to be a cost-effective option; therefore, it is
not recommended.
Assuming that cap-and-trade legislation is passed within the first year of a new presidential
administration (2009), it will most likely take EPA 3 years to complete the rulemaking (2012).
However, nearly all federal rulemakings are litigated, which could take another 2–3 years for a
final rule to emerge (2015). For these reasons, a federal cap-and-trade program is unlikely to
begin prior to 2015.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
The cap-and-trade program includes emissions from all six GHGs—CO2, CH4, N2O,
hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride—from the covered sectors.
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4 and N2O emissions.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Costs or Cost Savings
Not quantified: The GHG reductions and costs associated with this option have not been
quantified because of current uncertainties about the stringency of the MGA cap, which sectors
will be covered under the cap, as well as the degree of inclusion of flexibility mechanisms, such
as offsets.
Key Uncertainties
A number of design variables and the quality of data for cost curves and emission projections can
affect cap-and-trade simulation results, including permit prices, volume of permits traded, and
cost distribution among trading participants.
Additional Benefits and Costs
In addition to direct cost savings of compliance and GHG emission reductions, other potential
impacts are possible on labor, value added, income, market share of industries, energy
independence, energy prices, air quality, and other environmental or economic outcomes.
Feasibility Issues
None identified.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support

G-15

Barriers to Consensus
One member was concerned that not enough Midwest states were full participants in the capand-trade program.
Several members of the ICCAC believe that federal policies to reduce GHG emissions are
preferable to regional efforts like the MGA Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Platform.

G-16

CRE-4. Decarbonization Fund

Policy Description
A decarbonization fund is a fee on GHG emissions intended to transition society to a new, nonGHG-emitting state in the future. If multiple GHGs are covered, the global warming potentials of
the covered gases are normalized into CO2 equivalents prior to assessment of the fee. Thus,
carbon fee proposals usually provide an annual fee levied on each ton of CO2 or CO2e.
A small portion of a decarbonization fee is to provide some market signal to consumers to reduce
emissions. However, many GHG emissions result from necessities of life, such as heating and
cooling and the preparation of food. Thus, given the current state of technology, there are
practical and ethical limits to the assessment of a decarbonization fee for the purposes of a price
signal. Therefore, the fee for this policy option is applied only to the electric utility sector.
The most important policy aspect of a decarbonization fee is that the revenue generation
potential of even a small fee, feeding into a targeted decarbonization fund, can be significant.
Given this, the monies derived from a decarbonization fee can provide a strong incentive toward
GHG emission reductions. Thus, the most effective decarbonization fee design would include
both the front-end variables (i.e., the covered GHGs, the amount levied per ton of emissions) and
the back-end variables (i.e., where revenue is housed, how revenue is utilized).
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy are:
•

To help mitigate the potential impacts on the economy, the decarbonization fee should be
phased in and capped at a reasonable rate, allowing for long-term planning by consumers.
Therefore, as a starting point for the analysis, it is recommended that the decarbonization fee
for electric generation begin at $1/tCO2 in 2010 and increase by $1/year until a cap of
$10/tCO2 is obtained in 2019. The funding in 2019 is estimated at $320 million.

•

To help mitigate potential impacts on low-income consumers, it is recommended that 10% of
the funds derived from a decarbonization fee be directed toward targeted assistance (e.g., the
Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]) and energy efficiency programs.
LIHEAP funding would be approximately $32 million in 2019.

•

To ensure the proper accounting and availability of decarbonization funds, the fees would be
included in an adjustment clause, with costs passed directly to customers on a dollar-fordollar basis and the resulting revenue placed into a dedicated fund. The decarbonization
funds could only be utilized for programs and initiatives that transition the electric generating
sector to a low-carbon future (e.g., new non-emitting or low-emission generation, energy
efficiency, R&D of baseload renewables, and CCS). The Iowa Utilities Board (IUB) would
have the authority to audit and review the use of the decarbonization funds.

•

The decarbonization fee would be phased out, or reduced to a level that allows continued
future system emissions performance, once a 50% or 90% reduction in emissions from 2005
is achieved by 2050.

G-17

Timing: The program begins in 2010 at $1/ton CO2, and the fee reaches $10/ton in 2019.
Parties Involved: Potentially any entity, public or private, with a significant quantity of GHG
emissions or emission offsets.
Implementation Mechanisms
This policy would require adoption of a decarbonization fee by the Iowa Legislature and
implementation by appropriate state government agencies. It should be applied statewide,
requiring a rate mechanism approved through the IUB for rate-regulated utilities, with legislative
support, particularly for non-rate-regulated utilities.

The decarbonization fee could result in about 3,400 GWh of new renewable energy resources by
2020, which when combined with existing renewable resources results in a renewable energy
equivalent of 22% of energy generation. The cost-effectiveness per tCO2 is lower than the fee in
2020 for two reasons: (1) cost-effectiveness is measured as an average over the period, and (2)
the benefits from energy efficiency reduce the impacts of renewable generation that cost more
than existing thermal generation.
Data Sources: See CRE-2.
Quantification Methods: See CRE-2.
Key Assumptions:
• The decarbonization fee for electric generation begins at $1/tCO2 in 2010 and increases by
$1/year until a cap of $10/tCO2 is obtained in 2019, and is then kept constant through 2030.

G-18

•

The new renewable generation that results from the decarbonization fee comes 95.8% from
wind, 2% each from biomass and solar PV, and 0.2% from liquefied petroleum gas.

•

Efficiency is capped as a percentage of generation at 20%.

•

The funding goes 30% to efficiency, 40% to renewables, 10% to the Low-Income
Weatherization Fund, and 20% to R&D.

•

The levelized cost of energy efficiency measure is $37.13/MWh in 2009. The source for
capital costs is Quantec, Summit Blue Consulting, Nexant, Inc., A-TEC Energy Corporation,
and Britt/Makela Group (February 2008), Assessment of Energy and Capacity Savings
Potential in Iowa: Final Report, vol. I. This figure includes all utility and participant costs.
Utility fixed costs are assumed to be 24% of the capital cost, based on MidAmerican Energy
Company EE [energy efficiency] Action Plan filing Docket # EEP-08-02, vol. II, p. A1-8.

•

The avoided cost of electricity in 2009 is $72/MWh. The figure is from 2009–2013 Energy
Efficiency Plan Interstate Power and Light Company Docket No. EEP-08-123-Apr-08, p. 33.
The values base case is without an externality factor.

•

The real rate at which costs are discounted annually is 5%.

•

NPV is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

•

All electricity from coal-fired generation is coming from sources within Iowa (no imports).

•

Renewables displace marginal sources of generation (50% coal, 50% natural gas) through
2012. From 2013 on, renewables displace the thermal new-build mix of 99% coal, 1%
natural gas.

•

Energy efficiency measures are assumed to displace marginal sources of generation (50%
coal, 50% natural gas) through 2012. From 2013 on, energy efficiency displaces the newbuild mix of 78% coal, 21% renewables, and 1% natural gas.

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased renewables (the avoided CO2 methodology).4
Additional Benefits and Costs
•

The quantification does not include the 10% of funds that go to low-income assistance and
20% that goes to “other.” Thus, the emission reduction estimates are likely to be higher than
estimated in the quantification process.

•

A decarbonization fee has the potential for negative externalities, such as impacts on the
economy, particularly low-income consumers, and the potential that the funds would be used
for unrelated programs that do not directly assist the transition to a low-carbon future.
Therefore, these issues must be addressed explicitly at the creation of the decarbonization fee
policy.

CRE-5. Performance Standards

Policy Description
A generation performance standard (GPS) is an emissions rate hurdle that must be met for
compliance by sources supplying electricity to consumers in Iowa. Typically, a GPS is expressed
in pounds (lbs) of CO2/MWh. An RPS is a type of performance standard, identifying a target
percentage of a generator’s supply mix that must be from sources that meet the RPS’s definition
of renewable. A GPS can be applied to new generation or can include the system-wide emissions
rate of an entity’s generating fleet.
In either scenario, the theory of a GPS is to lower the emissions rate over time to obtain a desired
end point. Given this, a GPS can have many variables, including coverage of generating units or
load-serving entities, offsets, the inclusion of energy efficiency programs, technology incentives,
trading of renewable energy credits, penalty rates for noncompliance, emissions from purchased
power, triggers for on and off ramps, and the rate of change to the emissions standard. Each
factor can have a significant influence on the cost of compliance and thus on ratepayers.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy are to:
•

Identify the likely reasonable cost regulatory structures for a GPS to comply with the
scenarios modeled.

•

Analyze the costs and benefits of GPS scenarios to reach the:
5(a): 50% reduction goal from 2005 emissions levels by 2050, and
○ 5(b): 90% reduction goal from 2005 emissions levels by 2050.

○

Timing: This policy would require adoption of a GPS by the Iowa Legislature and
implementation by the IUB.
Parties Involved: The Iowa Legislature, IUB, and entities covered by the GPS.
Other: Various forms of GPS have been utilized by many states and countries to encourage
zero- and low-emitting generation, while providing regulatory flexibility in the compliance
pathway.
Implementation Mechanisms
To accomplish this policy option’s goals, an initial draft policy outline for a GPS is as follows:
•

The simplest approach to model the 50% and 90% reduction scenarios, from a 2005
emissions baseline, is a system-wide emissions rate from an entity’s generating fleet.

•

In 2005, the average emissions rate for electrical generating fleets in Iowa was approximately
1,800 lb CO2/MWh. By 2050, demand for electricity is expected to approximately double.
Therefore, the draft GPS path begins at 1,800 lb CO2/MWh in the year 2010. The end points

G-21

for the performance standards in 2050 are 450 lb CO2/MWh for the 50% reduction scenario,
and 90 lb CO2/MWh for the 90% reduction scenario. Nonetheless, it is important to note that
these end points are theoretical and will need to be amended according to real-world growth
in the demand for electricity.
•

The success of an emissions performance standard depends upon the reasonable cost
technologies available. Consistent with CRE-10, baseload renewable energy and CCS
technologies are not expected to be commercialized until the 2020–2025 time frame.
Therefore, the GPS must provide incentives for developing these technologies in Iowa.

•

The emissions performance standard for both goals begins in 2010 at 1,800 lb CO2/MWh for
an entity’s generating fleet. For the 50% scenario, the standard will be reduced by
approximately 33.75 lb CO2/MWh per year through 2050. For the 90% scenario, the standard
will be reduced by approximately 42.75 lb CO2/MWh per year through 2050.

•

Electric generating entities employing baseload renewable energy and CCS technology prior
to 2025 would receive a bonus multiplication factor for such MWh to stimulate technology
development. Between 2025 and 2030, the bonus multiplication factor would continue to be
granted for baseload renewable energy and CCS projects, but at a lower reward rate than
used between 2015 and 2025.

•

To encourage the development of biomass-based renewable energy, CO2 emissions from the
combustion of biomass (e.g., switchgrass, corn stover) or methane from the decomposition of
organic matter (e.g., landfill gas, manure biogas) would not count against the emissions
performance standard.

CRE-6. Voluntary GHG Commitments

Policy Description
Numerous U.S. companies and organizations, including many utilities, have taken on voluntary
GHG reduction commitments. Some of these are organized through EPA’s Climate Leaders
program. Others include participation in Power Partners and the EIA 1605(b) Voluntary GHG
Emission Reduction Program. Forty two companies, including some of the world’s largest—e.g.,
GE, Dupont, IBM, and Duke Energy—have joined together as the Business Environmental
Leadership Council (BELC) of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. These companies are
voluntarily addressing global climate change through proactive and innovative measures,
including setting targets for GHG emission reductions, implementing innovative energy supply
and demand solutions, improving waste management practices, participating in emissions
trading, and investing in carbon sequestration opportunities and research. Thirty-seven of these
BELC companies have established GHG reduction targets. Some of these companies have
achieved their targets and are currently evaluating new goals, while others are considering firsttime targets.
These commitments can be based on total GHG emissions in a given year or specific voluntary
projects, or can be defined on an intensity basis (tCO2e/MWh generated or delivered.) Some
entities with voluntary commitments also transact through the Chicago Climate Exchange
(CCX), a pilot program for reducing and trading GHG emissions in North America. Currently
more than 350 entities are participating in the CCX, including the University of Iowa and Iowa
Farm Bureau.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals for an Iowa Voluntary GHG program include:
•

Encourage Iowa businesses and citizens to voluntarily begin reducing GHG emissions
immediately, without waiting for mandatory Iowa or national GHG reduction program
measures. A goal of this program is to obtain voluntary commitments from each of Iowa’s
investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to reduce GHG emissions by at least 6% below the baseline
year 2005 emissions by 2010, and to obtain similar commitments from 25% of Iowa’s GHGemitting private businesses.

•

Provide a means for Iowa voluntary GHG emission reductions to be quantified and
recognized by applying Iowa-approved GHG quantification methods.

•

Allow rate-regulated utilities assurance of cost recovery for voluntary GHG reduction
measures that are reviewed and approved as prudent and reasonable by the IUB. The rates
charged by some utilities in Iowa are regulated and must be approved by the IUB. The rateregulated utilities in Iowa are MidAmerican Energy Company, Interstate Power and Light
Company, Aquila, Inc., Atmos Energy Corporation, and Linn County REC. The rates of the
rural electric cooperatives and the municipal utilities are not regulated or approved by the
IUB, except that Linn County REC has voluntarily asked that its rates be regulated. Rateregulated utilities would have to propose actions they would take to reduce their GHG

G-25

emissions for approval by the IUB. If the IUB approved those measures, cost recovery means
that the IUB would allow the rate-regulated utility to recover the cost of the approved GHG
reduction measures in rates the utility charges its customers.
•

Provide documentation that supports voluntary measures receiving full credit under a future
Iowa or national mandatory or voluntary GHG reduction program (e.g., credit for early
action).

•

Enable Iowa voluntary GHG emission reduction measures to receive credit as certifiable CO2
offsets for use inside and outside of the United States.

Timing: Upon promulgation of CRE-6.
Parties Involved: All sectors and sources that wish to provide for voluntary GHG reductions or
offsets, including government, utilities, industry, business, commercial building owners, and
homeowners.
Implementation Mechanisms
Legislation will provide for voluntary GHG emission reductions to be registered and for costsrecovery mechanisms. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) will be authorized to
provide voluntary measure recordkeeping and provide for review for public interest. The IUB
will be authorized to review and approve any costs for rate-regulated utilities.

CRE-7. Policies Related to Nuclear Power

Policy Description
Nuclear power has potential as an alternative source of electricity for meeting GHG reduction
goals. During operation, nuclear plants generate no GHGs, although, as with any new structure,
GHG emissions are associated with the construction of the facility. Nuclear power generation is
classified as baseload generation and is designed to operate at high-capacity factors. It is also the
largest single source of non-carbon-emitting electric generation. As a result, it is a potential
energy supply alternative, in large scale, to meet Iowa’s growing electric needs and for possible
long-term replacement of baseload coal-fired generation.
As of the end of the 2007, 104 commercial nuclear generating units were licensed by the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), with an electric capability of 97,400 MW. The most
recent reactor came on line in 2007. The current administration has been supportive of nuclear
expansion, emphasizing its importance in maintaining a diverse energy supply and its potential
for producing electricity with negligible GHG emissions during operation.
Other means of incorporating nuclear generation include license renewal and uprating for existing
plants. Nuclear license renewal allows a nuclear power plant to extend the life of the facility for 20
years past its original 40-year license term. The NRC considers the license renewal program one of
its major cornerstones of current regulatory activity. A nuclear power plant uprating is a technical
review process whereby a licensee may receive approval from the NRC to operate a plant at a
higher power level than the level authorized in the original license. License renewal and power
uprates typically require some capital investment for upgrades and rebuilding of plant subsystems.
Iowa’s only nuclear plant is the Duane Arnold Energy Center, which is owned by the FPL
Group, through its subsidiary FPL Energy (70% ownership), Central Iowa Power Cooperative
(20% ownership), and Corn Belt Power Cooperative (10% ownership). Duane Arnold received
approval for a power uprate in 2001, and currently has a license from the NRC to operate until
2014. In acquiring its ownership share in 2005, FPL committed to seek license renewal for an
additional 20 years, until 2034. MidAmerican Energy Company is a 25% owner of the Quad
Cities Nuclear Power Station near Cordova, Illinois, which also completed a power uprate, and
has received license renewal from the NRC to operate until 2032.
It is currently estimated that it would take approximately 10–12 years to design, permit, and
construct a new nuclear power plant. Therefore, steps should be taken today if Iowa chooses to
employ nuclear power as part of a balanced and diversified energy portfolio6 that achieves
Iowa’s long-term carbon emission reduction goals.
Policy Design
Goal: If deemed feasible, consider building one new 1200-MW nuclear power plant in Iowa.
The focus of this particular policy is to determine the economic feasibility of nuclear power in a

carbon-constrained environment, and to define specific state legislative and regulatory actions to
facilitate licensing, financing, and construction of new nuclear power plants in Iowa.
Timing: To have the plant operational by January 1, 2020.
Parties Involved: This policy would become effective with action by the Iowa Legislature and
implementation by the IUB, IDNR, and other state agencies. IOUs, generation and transmission
electric cooperatives, municipalities, Iowa Department of Public Health, environmental advocacy
groups, state legislators, county government and economic development leaders, business
advocacy groups, the Office of Energy Independence, and the Office of Consumer Advocate.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Unspecified.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
As a starting point, the analysis should assume that the NRC approves the license renewal
application for the Duane Arnold Energy Center.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from CO2 emissions, but also trace amounts of CH4, and N2O emissions.

G-29

Key Assumptions:
• That one new nuclear plant with a capacity of 1200 MW is operating in Iowa by 2020.
•

The existing Duane Arnold Energy Center is operating with a new license until 2034.

•

A 90% capacity factor for new nuclear units.

•

The real interest rate used to discount cash flows is 5%.

•

NPV is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

•

All electricity from coal-fired generation is coming from sources within Iowa (no imports).

Key Uncertainties
There are considerable uncertainties about the cost characteristics of new nuclear power. EIA’s
cost estimates for new nuclear are employed in this analysis, but are much lower than other
recent reports, such as Moody’s, that estimate installed costs of $5,700/kW.
As with other CRE modeling assumptions (e.g., natural gas, wind), the cost of nuclear power is
higher today than previously modeled. The latest numbers for nuclear power, based on an
average of data prepared by Progress Energy Florida and Florida Power and Light, estimate the
total levelized unit cost of nuclear power is $100/MWh ($2006 dollars) generated.7 This is nearly
double the $52/MWh used in the quantification for CRE-7 in Iowa.
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased renewables (the avoided CO2 methodology).8

G-30

Barriers to Consensus
Objections were raised that the costs of nuclear power are underestimated, and that significant
GHGs are associated with the extraction, refining, and disposal of nuclear waste.
Objections were also raised that many of the liabilities associated with nuclear power are not
reflected in the cost analysis of the ICCAC process. For example, its economics require
investments now that will not receive returns for 1–12 years, and it is unlikely that investors will
be will to capitalize such a project given the current crisis. Commercial nuclear wastes (spent
fuel rods) do not have a viable storage/disposal option at this time and require diligence for
40,000 years for the longest-lived isotopes to decay. Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is the proposed
repository, but it is not a popular option among people in Nevada or among the citizens of states
like Iowa through which the nuclear waste will need to be transported to reach its ultimate
destination. Terrorism and nuclear proliferation are additional concerns regarding the
transportation of high-level nuclear wastes. Also, reprocessing the wastes is currently not an
option in the United States. Considering all these liabilities, some ICCAC members felt that this
option did not merit being a part of the ICCAC’s portfolio of options, and it is not necessary to
utilize this option to achieve the scenario targets.

CRE-8. Support for Grid-Based Renewable Energy and Development

Policy Description
This policy option reflects financial incentives to encourage investment in renewable energy
resources by businesses and individuals that sell power commercially. Grid-based renewable
energy facilities are assumed to be those that interconnect directly with the transmission system.
Policies can be developed to help overcome financial barriers and increase incentives for
renewable energy development. Institutional barriers, such as low market prices, the inability of
the market to assign values to the public benefits of renewables and the social costs of fossil fuel
technologies, high transaction costs relative to smaller project sizes, and high financing costs
because of lender unfamiliarity and perceived risk, can be overcome through a suite of financial
and regulatory incentives for renewable energy development. These policies and incentives can
include:
•

Direct subsidies for buying or selling renewable generation equipment.

•

Tax credits or exemptions for buying or selling renewable generation equipment.

•

Government-sponsored or -facilitated loan programs for buying renewable generation
equipment.

•

Tax credits or direct subsidies for each kWh generated or sold from renewable generation
facilities.
Government-sponsored or -facilitated loan programs supporting the manufacture of
renewable generation equipment.

•
•

Direct subsidies supporting the manufacture of renewable generation equipment.

•

Tax credits or exemptions supporting the manufacture of renewable generation equipment.

•

Regulatory policies that provide incentives and/or assurance of cost recovery for utilities that
invest in renewable energy systems.
Regulatory policies that streamline certification requirements for renewable generation
plants.
Iowa regulatory support for federal transmission cost-allocation policies that are equitable
and promote the cost-efficient siting of renewable generation resources.

•
•

The reference case scenario predicts that renewables generation will rise from approximately 6%
of retail sales in 2005 to 11% in 2009, and will rise to 16% of retail sales by 2020.

G-32

Policy Design
Goals: This option includes two different pathways for promoting renewable energy
development: 8a more aggressive and 8b is less aggressive. For the purpose of quantification, 8b
is used for calculations and in the summary table.
• 8a (More aggressive case): Increase grid-based renewable electric production in Iowa by
400,000 MWh (400 GWh) of generation in the first year and growing by 1% of retail MWh
sales each year thereafter. This policy adds an average of 521 GWh of new renewable
resources per year over 2012–2020 and results in incremental renewables generation equal to
3.7% of retail sales by 2015, and 8.2% of retail sales by 2020. Including assumed reference
case renewables deployment, CRE-8a results in approximately 24.2% of renewables as a
percentage of retail sales by 2020, and 32.2% by 2030.
•

8b (Less aggressive case): The MGA renewable energy goal for the Midwest region
equivalent to 10% of retail MWh sales by 2015, 20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030. Iowa’s
reference case renewable generation exceeds the linear MGA target until approximately
2018, and then adds an average of 767 GWh of new renewable resources per year over 2018–
2020. CRE-8b results in new renewables generation equal to 4% of retail sales by 2020, and
additional increments equal to 1% of retail sales each year thereafter. Including assumed
reference case renewables deployment, CRE-8b results in the MGA target of 20% of
renewables as a percentage of retail sales by 2020, and 30% by 2030.

Timing:
• Beginning in 2012, continuing through 2020.
•

As specified in the MGA renewable energy goal.

Parties Involved: Grid-based renewable generation developers.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Identify barriers to grid-based renewable generation development.

•

Quantify barriers in dollar terms.

•

Determine specific incentive levels and durations needed to overcome barriers.

•

Set incentive levels and program limits to achieve grid-based renewable generation
development goals.

•

Provide federal production tax credit.

Electricity Supply (http://www.20percentwind.org/20p.aspx?page=Report) describes an
expansion of U.S. wind-generation capacity from 11.6 GW in 2006 to 305 GW by 2030, with
more than 10 GW located by 2030. This 10 GW of wind capacity in Iowa would be equivalent to
an Iowa goal of 40%–50%, based on estimated Iowa retail sales of 67,651 GWh in 2030 (i.e.,
40% goal if the combined wind capacity generates at a 31% capacity factor, and 50% goal if it
generates at a 39% capacity factor).

Key Assumptions:

production: wind (95%), solar PV (2%), and biomass (3%).

•

The real interest rate used to discount cash flows is 5%.

•

NPV is calculated in 2005 dollars beginning in 2009.

•

All electricity from coal-fired generation is coming from sources within Iowa (no imports).

•

Renewables displace marginal sources of generation (50% coal, 50% natural gas) through
2012. From 2013 on, renewables displace the thermal new-build mix of 99% coal, 1%
natural gas.

Key Uncertainties
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased renewables (the avoided CO2 methodology).9
As a sensitivity analysis, the assumption of avoiding 50% coal, 50% gas generation for the entire
planning period (2009–2020) instead of 2009–2012 in CRE-8a results in the year 2020 CO2
reductions decreasing from 4.8 to 3.5 MMtCO2, the cumulative 2009–2020 reductions decreasing
from 22.9 to 16.7 MMtCO2, and the cumulative 2009–2020 cost increasing from $24.40 to
$43.20/tCO2.

CRE-9. Transmission System Upgrading

Policy Description
Developing policies to address the long-term demand for electricity requires not only
consideration for enhancing the generating portfolio mix and demand-side and energy efficiency
programs, but also measures to improve both the regional and the local distribution systems in
order to diminish bottlenecks, enhance throughput, and reduce transmission line losses.
Opportunity exists to significantly increase transmission line carrying through the
implementation of new construction methods and retrofit activities on the transmission grid,
including incorporating advanced composite conductor technologies, reactive compensation
technologies, and grid management software. Siting new transmission lines can be a difficult
process, given their cost and perceived impacts on health, the environment, and the use,
enjoyment, and value of property. Future development of renewable energy facilities will require
the addition of new or the upgrade of currently existing transmission lines, which must be
integrated into the regional transmission grid. Policy measures in support of this option could
provide incentives to utilities and transmission owners to upgrade transmission systems and
reduce barriers to siting new transmission lines.
This policy assumes that all existing state and federal laws regarding the siting of transmission
will be followed as this policy is implemented. Reduction of barriers to the siting of new
transmission lines does not mean the protections afforded by currently applicable environmental
laws should be reduced. This policy option could also include reductions in the use and leakage
of sulfur hexafluoride from electrical equipment, plus use of efficient transformers and other
advanced materials and equipment. Given the long lead time (between 4 and 7 years) for large
transmission line planning, permitting, and construction, current distribution line capacity should
be evaluated immediately as a “quick start” measure to get carbon-free distributed generation on
the grid.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy are to:
•

Research how implementing modern grid technologies would enable a more efficient and
intelligent transmission system.

•

Identify specific legislative and regulatory actions that would be needed to support longterm, cost-effective alternatives that increase transmission system capabilities.

•

Commission a study that would identify areas in Iowa’s transmission system where
upgrading and/or expanding transmission would enable the state’s wind resources to be
developed for Iowa users and for potential exports to other states. The study would focus on
identifying both areas where large expansions are necessary to catapult Iowa’s wind
production, as well as areas where smaller upgrades would enable wind installations for local
area purposes. The study would seek to quantify the incremental costs and identify the
benefits and implementation time frames for alternatives that yield additional increases to

G-37

transmission and distribution (T&D) system capabilities, beyond normal planned expansion.
The analysis should take into account reductions in GHG emissions that would result from
energy saved due to lower line losses.
Timing: This policy would become effective with action by the Iowa Legislature and
implementation by the IUB and other state agencies.
Parties Involved: IUB, IOUs, generation and transmission electric cooperatives, municipalities,
representatives of environmental and economic development organizations, and the Office of
Consumer Advocate, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Midwest ISO, and
transmission owners (such as ITC Midwest).
Other: Fully utilize the existing grid by balancing the congestion points in the grid by
identifying and maximizing “sweet spots” that can match modest transmission capacity with
good renewable resources.
Implementation Mechanisms
Several energy efficiency measures can be implemented to reduce the T&D line losses of
electricity. Utilities use a variety of components throughout the T&D system to reduce losses.
Increasing the efficiency of these components can further reduce losses. Vermont, for example,
offers a rebate to encourage users to install energy-efficient transformers. Regulations, incentives,
and/or support programs can be applied to achieve greater efficiency of T&D system components.

CRE-10. R&D for Emerging Technologies and Corresponding Incentives

Policy Description
R&D of emerging technologies to develop demonstration projects and eventual
commercialization of reasonable-cost generation technologies with low or zero GHG emissions
is critical to solving the global climate change challenge. Technology areas often cited as
requiring such reasonable-cost developments are CCS (e.g., in deep saline aquifers or coal
seams) for fossil fuel facilities, and large-scale baseload renewable energy or technologies that
can transform intermittent renewables into baseload generation (e.g., batteries, compressed air
storage).
Given the magnitude of the task, an Apollo-like research program to create and field test such
technologies that are commercially viable is needed. At present, such funding is not a significant
portion of a rate-regulated utility's budget or the budgets of federal and state government
agencies. Nonetheless, even a small fee per kWh of electricity could generate significant
funding. However, funding is only half of the equation; strategies to use such funds to implement
a focused program to commercialize generation technologies with low or zero GHG emissions
must also be developed.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy, though unquantifiable in terms of emissions, are:
•

By 2009, identify the likely funding mechanisms and policy tools that would provide further
stimulus for the development of new, reasonable-cost, low- and zero-GHG-emitting
electricity generation in Iowa.

•

By 2009, analyze the costs and benefits of R&D program scenarios to help reach the 50%
and 90% reductions targets from 2005 emission levels by 2050.

•

By 2010, begin to implement the R&D funding mechanisms.

•

By 2015, identify and begin characterizing areas within and near Iowa that are likely
candidates for CCS, and begin larger-scale field studies of baseload renewable energy and
technologies that can transform intermittent renewables into baseload generation.

•

By 2020, complete larger-scale field studies and demonstrations of baseload renewable
energy and technologies that can transform intermittent renewables into baseload generation.
Prior to 2020, verify small-scale CCS test projects within suitable formations, and initiate
larger-scale projects.

•

By 2025, fully commercialize baseload renewable energy and technologies that can
transform intermittent renewables into baseload generation, and fully integrate CCS into new
coal-fueled power plants.

•

By 2030, commercialize reasonable-cost CCS technology for coal-fueled power plants that
were not originally designed for sequestration. Baseload renewable energy and technologies

G-40

that can transform intermittent renewables into baseload generation will be cost competitive
without subsidies or incentives.
Timing: See above.
Parties Involved: Iowa Legislature, IUB, electric utilities, and potentially other appropriate state
government entities, such as the Office of Energy Independence, Iowa Power Fund, Iowa
Department of Economic Development, and State Regents Institutions.
Other: The Iowa Power Fund is an example of a new state government board designed to help
stimulate the research, development, and commercialization of new clean energy sources in
Iowa.
Implementation Mechanisms
This policy may require the adoption of incentives by the Iowa Legislature, IUB, and potentially
other appropriate state government entities.

CRE-11. Distributed Generation/Co-Generation

Policy Description
This policy option focuses on encouraging investment in small-scale distributed generation (DG)
through incentives or subsidies and the prevention of barriers for both utility and consumer
investment.
Policy Design
Goal: 7500 MWh per year of new distributed renewable generation.
Timing: New distributed renewable generation beginning in 2010 and continuing each year
thereafter.
Parties Involved: All utilities serving customers in Iowa, state agencies with jurisdiction, other
interested stakeholders.
Other: A funding source to cover any financial incentives would need to be determined. The
level of credit or funding should be consistent for all utilities (IOUs, municipals, and
cooperatives). The cost of the incentive should be shared among all end users so that no one is
overly burdened.
Implementation Mechanisms
DG can be encouraged by ensuring access to the grid under uniform technical and contractual
terms and charges for interconnection, including mandatory insurance coverage and amounts,
that are based on economic costs, so that owners know in advance the requirements for parallel
interconnection, and manufacturers can design standard packages to meet technical requirements.
Changes that generally facilitate the integration of customer-owned DG with the grid could
encourage the adoption of specific renewable energy and high-efficiency technologies, including
small wind farms, solar PV systems, fuel cells, and microturbines. In addition, prices should be
established that owners of distributed generators both pay and receive for electricity at levels
consistent with utilities’ costs. Uniform requirements for emissions, land use, and building codes
should be established that are based on the technology of electricity generation, so that
manufacturers can design suitable units and owners of distributed generators are not restricted in
their siting and operating decisions relative to other new sources of generation.
Incentives for distributed renewables should include (1) direct subsidies for purchasing/selling
renewable technologies; (2) tax credits or exemptions for purchasing/selling renewable
technologies; (3) tax credits for each kWh generated from a qualifying renewable facility; (4)
rebates to the customer from utilities for the installation of a residential renewable energy system
similar to rebates for energy-efficient appliances; (5) state assistance for Iowa’s utilities to
implement a Smart Grid, which would more easily enable utility customers to be both users and
producers; and (6) hiring a DG point person who would work within the Office of Energy
Independence to assist utilities and customers to implement this policy, its incentives, and

G-43

regulatory requirements in order to fully utilize the benefits from DG and reach the ICCAC’s
goal of 90% reduction of GHG emissions by 2050.
DG can be encouraged by ensuring access to the grid under uniform technical and contractual
terms for interconnection that are based on best practices, so that owners know in advance the
requirements for parallel interconnection and manufacturers can design standard packages to
meet technical requirements. Changes that generally facilitate the integration of customer-owned
DG with the grid could encourage the adoption of specific renewable energy and high-efficiency
technologies, including solar PV systems, fuel cells, and microturbines. Uniform requirements
for emissions, land use, and building codes should be established that are based on the
technology of electricity generation, so that manufacturers can design suitable units and owners
of distributed generators are not restricted in their siting and operating decisions relative to other
new sources of generation.

CRE 12. Combined Heat & Power

Policy Description
Combined heat and power (CHP) is a term used to describe scenarios in which waste heat from
energy production is recovered for productive use. CHP scenarios most commonly occur at
baseload generating stations, so that a reliable source of thermal energy can be provided to the
users of the reclaimed thermal energy. The reclaimed thermal energy, while sometimes not of
significant energy value for the baseload generating station, can be used by other nearby entities
(e.g., within an industrial park or district steam loop) for productive purposes.
The theory of CHP is to maximize the energy use from fuel consumed and to avoid additional
GHG emissions from entities near a baseload generating station via additional fossil fuel
combustion. Generating stations in more rural areas will most likely require the co-location of
new industry, thereby avoiding new emissions from development. However, generating stations
in urban areas may have existing opportunities or may require the co-location of new industry.
Thus, this goal may be more effective at slowing and stopping emission increases by targeting
industrial development near baseload generating stations, rather than reversing current emissions
from existing industry.
The key to implementing CHP systems is to provide adequate incentives for the development of
infrastructure to capture and utilize the waste heat. Such incentives could come in many forms,
such as recruiting suitable end users to the area, tax credits, grants, zoning, and offset credits for
avoided emissions.
Policy Design
Goals: The goals of this policy are:
•

Biomass, ethanol, and wind sectors will grow and develop facilities that might use CHP.

•

To identify the likely policy tools that would provide significant stimulus for CHP
developments in Iowa by 2009.

•

To implement significant incentives for CHP development by 2010.

•

To quantify the maximum cost-effective contribution of CHP scenarios to help reach the
50% and 90% reduction targets from 2005 emission levels by 2050.

•

To provide sufficient stimulus to implement 50% of cost-effective CHP opportunities by
2025.

•

To provide sufficient stimulus to implement 90% of cost-effective CHP opportunities by
2035.

Timing: This policy may require the adoption of incentives by the Iowa Legislature and
appropriate state and local government agencies.

G-46

Parties Involved: Iowa Legislature, Iowa Department of Economic Development, electric
generating stations, city and county governments, and other agencies as appropriate.
Implementation Mechanisms
This policy may assist the transportation group and any renewable fuels goal that would require
an expansion of biofuel plants in Iowa. Such new plants could be given incentives to locate
where CHP opportunities exist.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Renewable Fuels Standards (U.S. and Iowa)
Iowa’s renewable fuel standard (RFS) is the most progressive standard in the country. The
standard will be implemented beginning in calendar year 2009, with incentives eligible in 2010.
The Iowa standard, in cooperation with the federal RFS, guides production and sets the following
goals for renewable fuel use over a span of 14 years:
•

25% biofuel sales in Iowa by 2019.

•

36 billion gallons produced in the United States by 2022.

•

50% reduction in GHG emissions from biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels.

•

20% reduction in GHG emissions from renewable fuels.

•

60% reduction in GHG emissions from cellulosic biofuels.

(Goals defined in Iowa RFS and the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act.)
Timing: Achieve by 2022 under the federal RFS and by 2019 under the Iowa RFS.
Parties Involved: Federal government, state government, producers, marketers, blenders,
consumers, and refiners.

CRE 13. Pricing Strategies To Promote Renewable Energy and/or CHP

Policy Description
This policy option focuses on creating pricing and metering strategies that can encourage
consumers to implement CHP, renewable energy, and overall reductions in GHG emissions.
Pricing strategies, such as feed-in tariffs, provide minimum utility purchase rates for DG. Net
metering is a policy that allows owners of DG (generating units on the customer side of the
meter, often limited to some maximum kW level) to generate excess electricity and effectively
sell it back to the utility by “turning the meter backward.”
Policy Design
Goal: Achieve a 10% shift to renewable energy sources, as a percentage of retail sales, through
implementation of various pricing strategies.
Timing: 1% shift achieved in 2010, with linear growth through 2019.
Parties Involved: All industrial, commercial, and residential electricity customers in Iowa;
utilities; representatives of environmental and economic development organizations; IUB, Office
of Consumer Advocate, Office of Energy Independence.
Implementation Mechanisms
Encourage net metering of renewable energy systems by:
•

Creating a centralized net metering program that is a one-stop shop for net metering. Staff
would work with customers and utilities to assist the process of net metering.

•

Providing incentives to utilities to net meter with their customers.

•

Providing incentives to customers to net meter with their utilities.

•

Establishing uniform standards and requirements for utilities and customers.

•

Requiring all Iowa’s utilities to net meter with interested customers who meet the minimum
requirements.

•

Rewarding utilities that show leadership in net metering measured by the number of
customers who are net metering and the amount of energy net metered.

Implementation of pricing strategies, such as feed-in tariffs, must be considered in light of
existing rules, such as the FERC’s avoided cost standard.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
•

•

Rate-regulated utility net metering tariffs.

•

According to current FERC rules, states may not require utilities to pay more than the
utility’s avoided cost of electricity. This potentially limits state application of feed-in tariffs.
Passage of a federal feed-in tariff law would supersede the FERC avoided cost standard.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Avoiding electricity generation from fossil fuel sources results in GHG reductions primarily
from carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), but also trace amounts of methane (CH4), and nitrous
oxide (N2O) emissions.

Self-generation and displacing part or all of one's own energy demand is more likely to be costeffective than interconnecting for small (i.e., less than 1 MW) generation sources. However, this
policy gives the impression that interconnection for small sources is technically and
economically feasible, and does not adequately address potential safety concerns to distribution
system electrical workers.

G-52

ANNEX A
Avoided Electricity Emissions for the Energy Supply Sector
To estimate emission reductions from policy options that are expected to displace conventional
grid-supplied electricity (i.e., renewable energy and CHP), a simple, straightforward approach is
used. Through 2012, we assume that these policy options would displace generation from the a
“marginal” mix of fuel-based electricity sources of 50% coal and 50% gas. (We assume that
sources without significant fuel costs would not be displaced—e.g., hydro or other renewable
generation.) After 2012, we assume that the policy options are likely to avoid a mix of new fossil
fuel-based capacity additions. The thermal new-build mix is estimated to be 99% coal and 1%
gas.
There is a risk that GHG reductions are overstated and the costs per ton of CO2e reductions are
understated, if high-CO2-intensity resources are assumed to be redispatched or not built due to
increased renewables (the avoided CO2 methodology).
As a sensitivity analysis, the assumption of avoiding 50% coal, 50% gas generation for the entire
planning period (2009–2020) instead of 2009–2012 in CRE-8a results in the year 2020 CO2
reductions decreasing from 4.8 to 3.5 MMtCO2, cumulative 2009–2020 reductions decreasing
from 22.9 to 16.7 MMtCO2, and the cumulative 2020 cost increasing from $24.40 to
$43.20/tCO2.
The reference approach described in the beginning of this annex provides a transparent way to
estimate emission reductions and to avoid double counting (by ensuring that the same MWh
from a fossil fuel source is not “avoided” more than once). It can be considered a “first-order”
approach; it does not attempt to capture a number of factors, such as the distinction between
peak, intermediate, and baseload generation; issues in system dispatch and control; impacts of
nondispatchable and intermittent sources, such as wind and solar; or the dynamics of regional
electricity markets. These relationships are complex and could mean that policy options affect
generation and emissions (as well as costs) in a manner somewhat different from that estimated
here. Nonetheless, this approach provides reasonable first-order approximations of emission
impacts and offers the advantages of simplicity and transparency that are important for
stakeholder processes.

Overlap Discussion:
The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced and the costs of a policy option within
the Transportation and Land Use (TLU) sectors overlap with some of the quantified benefits and
costs of policy options within other sectors. Where this overlap has been determined to exist, the
sector totals have been adjusted and each instance is outlined below. Overlaps between options
within TLU have been accounted for within the goal-setting process.
TLU-10 (Fuel Strategies) overlaps with AFW-6 (Cellulosic Biofuels). TLU-10 promotes the
development of a Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which could potentially include cellulosic
biofuels already accounted for in AFW-6. To adjust for the overlap between these two
Subcommittees, the AFW sector total emission reductions and costs were reduced by the
proportion determined to be included under the TLU-10 analysis.
TLU-1 (Smart Growth Bundle with Transit) and TLU-1a (Expand and Improve Transit
Infrastructure) are also very closely related and complementary or each other. Creating higher
density, mixed-use developments works best when transit can be incorporated into the
developments. Conversely, transit works best when it is located in higher density populations to
achieve the necessary ridership to allow transit to be feasible. Although these policy options are
closely related, the complementary nature of these policies did not, however, impact their
quantification. Each of these policies has been independently quantified for both emissions
reductions and costs.
TLU-5a (Adopt Best Workplaces for Commuters in Iowa) and TLU-5b (Distributed Workplace
Models) both focus on reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by adjusting commuter patterns.
TLU-5a focuses on telecommuting as well as utilizing alternative modes of transportation for
commuting to work, while TLU-5b focuses on the development of workplace clusters being
placed within communities thereby minimizing the VMT associated with workplace commuting.
While complementary of one another, the subcommittee did not see these policies as
overlapping. TLU-5a was quantified, but due to the planning required to determine how the
distributed workplace model would function most effectively in a given community this policy
option (TLU-5b) was not quantified.
No reductions from recent actions as identified in the policy options have been made to the TLU
sector totals.

TLU-1. Smart Growth Bundle

Policy Description
The Smart Growth Bundle includes policies that will align growth and development in Iowa with
GHG reduction goals. Developing statewide policies to implement smart growth will have
significant economic, social, and ecological benefits for communities across Iowa. This bundle
of policies includes the following elements:
•

Downtown revitalization, infill and brownfields∗ redevelopment

•

Transit-oriented development

•

Smart growth planning, modeling, and tools

•

Bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure

•

Growth management planning

•

Technical and financial support to local and regional agencies

•

Reforms of local zoning, tax, and building codes

Smart growth policies that affect land use and transportation patterns are proven to reduce
vehicle miles traveled (VMT). This will enable more Iowans to conveniently travel on foot, by
bicycle or transit, or with shorter driving trips. Improving planning tools and software applied in
Iowa will enable accurate quantification of VMT reduction of various smart growth policies. The
combination of these policies will ensure maximum impact.
Achieving reductions in VMT through smart growth policies will occur through:
•

Strategic Growth and Development—Enable local governments to improve community
design and direct growth to locations that will result in reduced VMT. The state will establish
and maintain a land use policy framework that ensures that local land use planning satisfies
both state goals and local interests. This framework will include: greater coordination
amongst local governments and state agencies, strategic development areas where
metropolitan growth boundaries support reduction of VMT, and focused redevelopment
strategies that ensure efficient use of land and existing infrastructure.

•

Education and Technical Assistance—Communities will be given flexibility and choices to
achieve VMT reduction goals through their growth and development. Local governments and
other stakeholders, such as developers and private lending institutions, will be provided
technical assistance that will include diverse strategies for communities to consider using in
reaching VMT reduction goals. (i.e., model zoning code provisions, local tax code reform to
achieve smart growth, etc.) Education will be provided to parties involved with

Brownfields are abandoned or under-utilized commercial and industrial areas, often within or close to the urban
core.
H-3

implementation, as well as to the general public in order to overcome barriers to accepting
smart growth and to encourage sustainable lifestyles like biking and walking.
•

Incentives and Funding Programs—Existing incentives, funding, and loan programs
administered by the state that are applicable to growth and development will be assessed and
realigned to support the elements of this smart growth bundle of policies. Rating systems and
prioritization of funding will be reviewed and improved to meet smart growth objectives.
New programs will be developed and existing programs will be revised to fill in gaps where
no program exists to meet needs that can’t be achieved, or are far less likely to be achieved,
without funding assistance. (i.e., improved brownfields and greyfields∗ incentives increased
technical assistance funding for Iowa Downtown Resource Center.)

Details of specific policies and programs that fall under the above three categories will be
outlined in the Implementation Mechanisms category of this document.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Achieve quantifiable/measurable VMT reduction goals of 10% per capita off the baseline
projection for 2020 in urban areas through smart growth. The state of Iowa will enable
growth and development to achieve VMT reduction goals through a series of policies,
including implementation mechanisms identified below. Scientific research shows that VMT
reduction in urban areas is quantifiable through improved planning software. Iowa agencies
will assist local and/or regional governments in using the latest planning technology that
measures VMT impacts to assist with decision-making on future growth and development.
The more aggressively the policies are pursued, the greater the potential reduction in VMT
that would be achievable.
Additional goals:
• VMT reduction goals of 20% per capita reduction off baseline forecast for 2030
•

VMT reduction goals of 30% per capita reduction off baseline forecast for 2050

•

Incorporate unique rural VMT reduction strategies—although rural areas of the state will
have more limited opportunities to reduce reliance on the automobile, smart growth policies
will still be implemented to reduce auto dependence within small communities and reduce
the need to drive far away for employment, retail goods, or services.

•

Integrate with Transit Policy When Applicable—Land use practices are a key component of
reducing VMT with expanded and improved transit infrastructure. The implementation of the
Smart Growth Bundle, with Transit Infrastructure policy (TLU-4), will be coordinated
whenever applicable to achieve maximum reduction of greenhouse gases through efficient
implementation.

•

Integrate GHG Reductions from Other Sectors When Applicable—Policies intended to reduce
GHG through other sectors besides transportation, such as generation or consumption of
electricity will be tied together when implementation mechanisms present an opportunity to

∗

Greyfields are old, obsolete and abandoned retail and commercial sites, usually malls.
H-4

achieve maximum GHG emissions from multiple sectors. (i.e., incentives for downtown
revitalization will also be tied to green building standards when applicable)
Timing:
2009—Development of metropolitan growth boundaries and involvement of utility and service
providers (water, wastewater).
2009—Administrative policies or actions that do not require new funding sources will begin.
2009—Policies that require state legislation should be considered during the legislative session.
2009–2010—Use of planning tools and software to analyze transit and land use scenarios for
VMT reduction.
2009–2012—Adoption of metropolitan growth boundaries, and revisions to those boundaries
every three years that will include VMT reduction measurements and goals.
2009–2012—Municipalities will develop and implement policies that support and promote high
quality, dense developments at hubs and nodes along identified rapid transit routes. Other local
policies will be adopted to reduce VMT through community design. State technical assistance
will be provided, where needed, in order to relieve barriers to local implementation.
2012—State funding will be fully realigned to support VMT reduction.
2020—Full implementation with evident VMT reduction results achieved through this policy.
Parties Involved: Cities, counties, Iowa State University Extension, University of Iowa,
Metropolitan Planning Organizations and Councils of Governments, transit service providers and
transit agencies, utility providers, water and sewer service providers, Environmental Protection
Agency, Iowa Department of Natural Resources, Department of Transportation, Department of
Economic Development, Department of Public Health, Iowa Finance Authority, Office of
Energy Independence, USDA Rural Development, non-profit organizations with developmentrelated interests (environment, economic development, human services, etc), developers,
planners, lenders, school districts, contractors, homebuilders, employers.
Implementation Mechanisms
Establish and adopt a statewide “complete streets” policy that incorporates transit, bicycle and
pedestrian facilities in state, or state-facilitated and federally funded transportation projects as
appropriate. The policy will require documentation of the consideration and decision-making
process of transit, bicycle and pedestrian facilities for all roadway projects.
A Governor’s Executive Order will create a Community Investment cabinet to guide state
planning and investments to local communities. This cabinet-level position and office is essential
in coordinating a new framework for state agencies and state funding streams. The Office of
Community Investment (or similar name) will work with the Iowa legislature and the directors
of state agencies. Other states across the country have created similar cabinet-level offices to
spearhead new land use and development initiatives, to ensure that state dollars are spent
H-5

efficiently to meet state goals, and that state agencies are operating in a cohesive manner to reach
state goals for community development. This cabinet will be responsible for monitoring and
ensuring that investments are tied to communities who are successfully reducing VMT and
making progress on policies that will lead toward VMT reduction. This will happen in a variety
of state investments such as transportation dollars, sewer and water funding, housing funding,
and redevelopment incentives.
Performance measures such as the following will be established in coordination with the parties
involved in the implementation of this policy:
•

Utilize new planning software to produce land use scenarios in Iowa communities, showing
their impact on Vehicle miles traveled. Measure local and regional land use plans with VMT
software. Use this technology to guide local decision-making and incent climate-friendly
development patterns.

•

Develop land use inventories to track the underutilized or undeveloped property within
existing city limits and the conversion rate of greenfields (i.e., farmland, natural areas) to
development. Use these periodic inventories to measure how development patterns are
shifting to compact development, and whether smart growth strategies are having the desired
statewide impact.

Strategic Growth and Development
Greater coordination of local governments and state agencies, and planning for growth to support
the reduction of VMT, will require:
•

Metropolitan Growth Boundaries will be established in the nine largest urban areas, in
cooperation with service providers and local governments. The boundaries will show a 20year projection for growth and development. Boundaries will be based on regional
population projections, which utilize county-level population projections provided by the
state (such as Regional Economic Models, Inc.), and increased densities with compact
development to support VMT reduction goals.

•

Urban Service Areas will address the growth of a given city, in an agreement with county
governments within Iowa’s nine metropolitan areas and other areas projecting rapid growth.
These are cooperative agreements to control rural large lot development; address where a city
has the capacity to improve infrastructure in order to accommodate growth and development;
and inform local and state decision-making on annexation requests.

•

Priority Growth Areas will be designated in every county of the state, including cities
within rural counties. Priority Growth Areas include town centers, downtowns, neighborhood
centers and commercial districts, transit corridors, and transit station areas. Encourage higher
density housing and employment growth, mixed-use and mixed-income development, and
bicycle, pedestrian, and transit-friendly development within these areas.

Redevelopment strategies that ensure efficient use of land and existing infrastructure will entail
the establishment of the above three tools in order to tie state goals to funding of local
communities. Decision making on aligning state incentives and goals with local interests must
include
H-6

•

An extensive inventory of state-level funding, incentives and programs that guide growth and
development. This inventory, which may take up to a year to complete, will include
information on programs such as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, the Road Use Tax
Fund, Community Development Block Grants, business development programs such as the
Iowa Values Fund, Tax Increment Financing, and other areas of the state’s role in local
development. This inventory will detail how existing programs are helping increase vehicle
miles traveled and what their potential role is in meeting state VMT goals. It will also
identify the decisions the state makes about growth and development that are not necessarily
tied to funding streams. (i.e., the state-level City Development Board). This inventory will be
administered out of the Office of Community Investment.

•

Guiding state decisions to align with VMT goals may occur through a variety of
implementation mechanisms, depending on the source and the decision-making process. (i.e.,
state legislation, administrative rule-making, changing scoring systems on funding
applications, creating simple check lists to inform state-level boards on decision-making.)

•

State boards and commissions who make quasi-judicial, funding, or regulatory decisions on
growth and development will use new criteria in their decision-making processes. (i.e. Iowa
Finance Authority Board, City Development Board, Environmental Protection Commission)
These criteria will include indicators of VMT-reducing practices such as increased densities
of 7 DU/acre or more, complete pedestrian infrastructure, and mixed use development.

Education and Technical Assistance
State agencies will expand education and technical assistance to Iowa communities about
meeting greenhouse gas reduction goals, including smart growth strategies. This education and
technical assistance will be developed with the advice of local governments, academics, and
other stakeholders. State agencies will share responsibility in implementing cooperative
strategies, where deemed appropriate. VMT reduction can occur through such a wide range of
activities, such as changes in consumer behavior, development and land use decisions, increasing
transit ridership, and others. Not every community will be expected to use the exact same tools to
reach a common statewide VMT goal. Funding and technical assistance will be provided from
state agencies to help local communities update comprehensive plans, zoning, and other local
regulation to help encourage VMT reduction. State agencies may contract with non-profit
organizations or private entities, with expertise and experience in these areas, to work with
communities on behalf of state agencies.
One learning curve to receive a lot of attention will be the use of new planning software that
measures VMT growth associated with community development scenarios. Different ways of
utilizing this information can be found in places like Denver, Colorado and Sacramento,
California. Because of advances in technology, the state of Iowa can be a leader in planning
climate-friendly communities by capturing this opportunity at the forefront. Funding for software
technology could be provided by the state, or through cap-and-trade auctioning revenues.

H-7

State Agency Involvement in Education and Technical Assistance
Department of Economic Development
• Strengthen and increase funding for the Iowa Downtown Resource Center and Main Street
Iowa program to provide technical assistance to cities engaged in repositioning and
revitalizing their downtown areas and urban neighborhood commercial districts.
•

Fund a cooperative study between the Iowa DOT and the Iowa Downtown Resource Center
to help identify specific travel habits in rural areas. This study would identify areas of
business and community development, where viable, that could reduce trips taken for needs
like entertainment, groceries, health care services, etc.

•

Continue the newly established Iowa Green Communities Program. Use that program to
convene other state agencies to advance green community principles and criteria. Conduct
workshops for cities, developers, and stakeholders about how to design community
development projects to fit smart growth criteria. Develop a public information program
promoting the acceptance of infill and higher densities in exiting neighborhoods.

•

Engage the Business Development Division in assisting private investments associated with
transit-oriented development. (i.e., streetcars, trolleys, commuter rail, and the commercial
development process around transit stations/stops). Develop educational materials about how
businesses can attract new customers who use transit, foot, or bicycle.

•

The City Development Board and agency staff will provide communities with education
about implementing smart growth principles in existing and new neighborhoods, as well as
improving practices for public participation in development decisions.

Department of Natural Resources
• Increase funding for the Iowa Brownfield Redevelopment Program. Assist cities in working
through regulatory requirements to allow brownfield reuse and redevelopment. Work with
cities to develop or update inventories of qualifying brownfield and greyfield sites.
•

The Water Quality Division, and any appropriate offices in the division, will cooperate with
other agencies that provide funding for sewer and water infrastructure, such as the Iowa
Finance Authority and Iowa Department of Economic Development to prioritize
improvements needed within the existing city limits of cities which both meet the state’s
water quality goals and are located within the identified Priority Growth Areas. The Water
Quality Division will also provide technical assistance to communities regarding the
processes of updating their infrastructure and the funding that is available to do this for
communities located within targeted Priority Growth Areas.

Department of Public Health
• Create an education campaign to educate bicyclists, motorist and pedestrians about the health
benefits of bicycling and walking. Create pilot communities and showcase those who do
more to embrace and design for walking and biking.
Department of Cultural Affairs
• Expand technical assistance for historic preservation projects, especially those located in
Priority Growth Areas and/or serving a public purpose such as libraries and city halls.

H-8

Department of Transportation
• Establish a program within DOT administrative planning processes that will help
communities integrate land use and transportation planning. A model for this can be found in
Pennsylvania with Penn DOT’s Sound Land Use Implementation Plan.
http://www.dot.state.pa.us/Internet/Bureaus/CPDM.nsf/LandUseHomepage?OpenFrameset
•

Share responsibility and cooperate with the Iowa Department of Economic Development in
the study to help identify specific travel habits in rural areas.

•

Cooperate with Iowa State University’s Center for Transportation Research and Education.
Update the Iowa Statewide Urban Design and Specifications Manual to incorporate new and
improved standards for appropriate bicycle, pedestrian, and transit accommodation in
transportation and development projects. Iowa State University (ISU) and DOT will
cooperate with state agencies, transit providers, and other interested parties in the update of
the manual.

Incentives and Funding Programs
The inventory of state-level incentives and funding programs that guide growth and development
will assist in identifying the realignment of programs needed to support state VMT reduction
goals. State agencies will assist in evening the cost differentials between greenfield development
and brownfield sites by giving priority to infill projects and/or designated Priority Growth Areas.
Require state government agencies to consider local land use comprehensive plans, zoning
ordinances, Metropolitan Growth Boundaries, and Urban Service Areas in making certain permit
and funding decisions. Public investments would only be made when the existing infrastructure
systems are at capacity or all available land is developed.
Strategies To Realign State Funding
• Extend and expand the new Iowa Brownfields/Greyfields Tax Credit Program. Expand
eligible costs to include site assessments.
•

Incorporate preferential rating of brownfield and greyfield sites into a point system for
receiving federal transportation funds, acknowledging the negative impacts of continuing to
develop new interchanges and greenfield sites.

•

Develop new criteria for sewer loans, bonding and funding. Projects can only qualify for
state funding for new capacity when available land is developed and existing sewer system is
either in a state of good repair, or has a plan in place for improving it within five years.

•

Limit Tax Increment Financing districts in greenfields.

•

Adopt a new “complete streets” policy for state Department of Transportation (DOT)-funded
roadway projects. The policy will require consideration of transit, bicycle and pedestrian
facilities for all roadway projects and documenting their consideration and the decisionmaking process. The policy will incorporate public input on its effectiveness in serving all
users—pedestrians, cyclists transit riders and motorists. Apply new criteria to road funding
programs, such as the Revitalize Iowa’s Sound Economy (RISE) program, to ensure that new
roads/improvement projects are designed create access to employment centers and to create
transportation choices for workers.

H-9

•

Extend and expand the Historic Preservation Tax Credit Program; remove the artificial cap.

•

Give infrastructure funding priority to areas that have concurring sewer, water, and road
planning that does not induce demand or catalyze sprawling development on the urban
fringe. This would be identified in the Metropolitan Growth Boundary and Urban Service
Area agreements.

This analysis considers potential GHG reductions from reductions in VMT for personal (noncommercial) travel, as a result of a shift towards more compact development patterns. The
analysis relies on estimates of per-capita VMT by U.S. Census tract population density range, as
developed by Polzin, et al. for the Center for Urban Transportation Research (CUTR) VMT
forecasting model. The CUTR model is based on analysis of 2001 Nationwide Household Travel
Survey data. The model provides estimates of per-capita VMT by state for five density ranges.
The model is currently set up for years 2005, 2035, and 2055; for this analysis, results were
interpolated for Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) analysis years 2012 and 2020.
The observed relationship between per-capita VMT and population density is a rough proxy for
the effects of Smart Growth development as described above. Higher levels of population density
are associated with overall shorter trips because destinations are closer together. In addition,
areas with higher population densities are more likely to have pedestrian-friendly design
(walkability, mixed-use, etc.) and to support transit service. It is difficult to separate out the
individual effects of the various Smart Growth strategies at this aggregate level of analysis, but
the analysis should provide an indicator of what can be achieved through a combined set of
Smart Growth policies.
There are strong linkages and interdependencies between transit and land use. Hence, their
effects and costs, as they specifically relate to areas which are engaged in smart growth
development, were jointly estimated here. Although there are significant synergies between
transit and land use, outside of areas which are engaged in smart growth development, those
synergies were already accounted for in the separate stand alone analyses of transit and land use.
Hence, they were not included here to avoid double-counting. In particular, the transit analysis
assumes a greater VMT reduction than that from transit ridership alone due to induced land use

H-10

effects. Similarly, the CUTR VMT rates used for the land use analysis presume the provision of
sufficient transit service.
Data Sources:
• Total population and population density by Census tract, 1990 and 2000.
•

Per-capita VMT by Census tract population density in Iowa, from CUTR VMT forecasting
model.

•

Forecast statewide population growth

Quantification Methods:
The specific method used to estimate GHG benefits of Smart Growth strategies is as follows:
•

Total population in 2000 is identified by five U.S. Census tract density ranges as identified in
the CUTR model (<500, 500–1,999, 2000–3,999, 4,000–9,999, and 10,000 or more persons
per square mile).

•

The change in population from 1990 to 2000, and associated share of change by density
range, is identified from Census data.

•

For the Baseline scenario, new population growth between 2000 and 2020 (as determined
from CCS baseline assumptions) is allocated to U.S. Census tract density ranges based on the
share of growth in the 1990–2000 timeframe.

•

The proportion of existing housing stock (population) that would be redeveloped over this
timeframe is estimated at 15%, of which two-thirds is redeveloped in place and one-third is
redeveloped elsewhere, with this redevelopment allocated to census tract density ranges
based on the 1990-2000 share of population growth. (The 15% and two-thirds figures come
from the 2007 Growing Cooler report Section 1.7.3, citing analysis of Census data by Nelson
(2006)).

•

The Climate Action scenario assumes a significant shift in the proportion of new
development and relocated redevelopment takes place, with higher-density tracts (>4,000
persons per square mile) receiving 60% of new development under this scenario compared to
effectively no growth under the Baseline scenario. Total population by tract density under
this scenario is then calculated.

•

Total personal-travel VMT is calculated under the Baseline and Climate Action scenarios
based on VMT per capita (from the CUTR model) and total 2025 population by tract density
range, and the percent reduction in personal-travel VMT is calculated.

•

Costs were estimated for implementing regional vision processes in large, medium and small
cities ($22 million over 12 years), State Policy/Code Revision and Implementation ($2.2
million over 12 years), and municipal policy/code/zoning revisions ($12 million over 12
years). Savings were estimated for avoided infrastructure costs (highway, water and sewer)
and fuel savings.

•

The costs of providing additional transit services were estimated as described below in TLU1-a. The operating and capital costs of providing additional services, offset by the federal
cost share and the savings from reduced personal vehicle operating costs, were calculated. As
H-11

described above, the cost of avoided infrastructure construction and the tons of CO2 reduced
by transit were not included in these totals to avoid double-counting.
Key Assumptions:
• Fraction of new population growth and redevelopment by U.S. Census tract density, under
baseline scenario.
•

Assumed shift in fraction of new population growth and redevelopment from lower-density
to higher-density Census tracts, under Climate Action vs. baseline scenario.

•

Percent of residential building stock redeveloped (off-site) over the analysis timeframe.

Key Uncertainties
Smart Growth scenario analysis depends upon patterns of development that involve decisions of
many individual property owners and private capital investors. As a result, the scenarios show
what is possible under smart growth development, but should not be considered as predicted
outcomes.
The estimates developed using this methodology are consistent with results found in metaanalysis in the published literature, such as the recent Urban Land Institute (ULI) report Growing
Cooler.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Smart growth generally has very low direct costs to implement, comprised of the governmental
costs of altering regulations and zoning and providing education and technical assistance. Tax
incentives are an income transfer that results in public sector costs but offsetting developer
revenues. As most smart growth policies (e.g., allowing higher density and mixed use, reducing
parking requirements) are deregulatory in nature, they are opening up the development market
and have significant indirect benefits. An exception is growth boundaries, which restrict the land
use market and have an indirect cost.
Alternative patterns of development have a large number of additional impacts, which may both
provide benefits and costs. Smart growth provides a range of co-benefits that are well
documented in other places. Prominent among these is the reduced cost of providing utilities and
infrastructure, as smart growth makes better use of existing facilities and infrastructure.
Improved air quality, public health (e.g., due to reduced air pollution and to walking), and quality
of life are also notable co-benefits.
Transit services have a large number of additional impacts which provide additional benefits.
Transit service provides mobility, accessibility, and safety benefits that are not included in the
analysis above. Important other co-benefits are similar to those noted above: improved air
quality, public health, and quality of life. Transit benefits in reducing congestion and facilitating
land use patterns such as transit-oriented development and smart growth are very significant and
as noted are partially reflected in the analysis above.

TLU-1a. Expand & Improve Transit Infrastructure

Policy Description
Improvements and expansion of existing transit service and implementation of new, innovative
transit services can shift more passenger transportation to public transit, thereby reducing
Vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Public transportation improvements are critical to support Smart
Growth initiatives (as referenced in TLU-1) and are essential to an ongoing effort to reduce
VMT. This policy includes four components of change that are needed on the state level to
expand and improve transit infrastructure.
•

Funding—Current levels and allocation formulas of state funding for transit are inadequate to
substantially expand and improve transit infrastructure to reduce VMT. This proposal
outlines several funding levels and potential sources to meet these needs, although other
funding sources not listed in this proposal will also be considered in the years to come.

•

Studies and Planning—While a few local metropolitan areas have completed rapid transit
(i.e., Bus Rapid Transit, commuter rail) studies, the state will provide the technical assistance
and leadership needed to assist or help initiate future studies with local and regional
governments. Transit projects and local transit agency goals will be reflected in the State
Transportation Plan and will be considered in any inventory of funding needs for traffic
mitigation and studies of specific roadway capacity. Currently, travel demand models in Iowa
are not able to directly consider the impacts of additional or expanded transit service on total
VMT in an area. This ability needs to be researched further and implemented along with
other tools that can provide quantifiable estimates of VMT reduction due to additional or
expanded transit service along with land use patterns.

•

Technical Assistance—The state will provide technical assistance, where needed, to promote
transit-oriented development around transit nodes or hubs. Land use and transportation
coordination will be improved to increase ridership through land use changes that support
transit use in urban areas.

•

Transit Marketing and Promotion—Incentives and marketing strategies aimed at increasing
transit use will be pursued as a means to shift more passenger transportation from cars to the
existing transit systems and increase demand for transit.

Policy Design
Goals:
The state will expand and improve transit infrastructure to reduce VMT and achieve an annual
ridership increase of 100% by the year 2020. This will be measured on a per capita basis in order
to prevent population demographics from affecting the transit ridership goal. The goal of this set
of activities is for the state to provide the leadership and resources necessary to help create
expanded transit and ridesharing networks throughout the state that will provide Iowans with
choices and will reduce VMT.

H-14

Funding Goals—Current state transportation financing policy emphasizes maintenance and
capacity improvements to the road network to meet projected future VMT increases. The state
will adopt revised transportation financing policies that meet the state’s emission and greenhouse
gas reduction goals by reducing VMT through support of public transit operating and capital
investment. Goals for funding include:
•

Direct more funding to help cover a significant percentage of annual operating costs for
transit systems.

•

Support transit capital investments.

•

Designate state funding specifically for the purposes of transit services designed to reduce
VMT.

•

Sources of this funding will be dedicated, reliable, predictable, and able to grow despite
inflation.

Funding, studies/ planning, technical assistance, and transit marketing/promotion will address the
needs to:
•

Improve service frequency on selected existing transit routes.

•

Offer more forms of transit services and infrastructure (e.g. commuter rail, urban streetcars,
bus, bus rapid transit (BRT), passenger stations, facilities, suburban park-and-ride lots).

•

Reduce travel times on selected existing transit routes (signal prioritization, exclusive lanes,
technology improvements, etc.).

•

Improve service quality on selected transit routes (safety, cleanliness, enhanced bus
stops/shelters, and real-time schedule communications).

•

Expand longer distance ridesharing activities by promoting carpool and vanpool services
throughout the state.

•

Reduce or eliminate transit fares paid by riders that hinder ridership growth, by implementing
other funding strategies (e.g. employer subsidies, state incentive funds, etc.).

Timing:
2009: Administrative policies or actions that do not require new funding sources will begin.
2009: Policies that require state legislation will be considered during the legislative session.
2009–2010: Use of planning tools and software to analyze transit and land use scenarios for
VMT reduction.
2010–2020: Full Implementation.

H-15

Implementation Mechanisms
The rising cost of fuel will cause more Iowans to rely on public transit for travel needs.
However, it will also increase pressure on the operating costs of local and regional transit
agencies. This dynamic points to the need for implementing transit infrastructure strategies that
create dependable services, while enabling performance measures to target funding for efficient,
VMT-reducing services that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.
Iowa must address existing shortfalls of annual state funding, identify methods to provide the
required state matching funds to federal transit funding programs, and allocate transportation
funding based on VMT performance measures.
Funding
Regional Transit Authorities and Enabling New Local Funding:
• Most urban areas in Iowa are currently at a disadvantage to expand transit infrastructure due
to a limitation in the Iowa Code about Regional Transit Authorities (RTA). Currently, only
the two largest urban areas, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids, are eligible to create RTAs. The
Iowa General Assembly will pass legislation to expand RTA eligibility to all transit systems
in Iowa. This will enable those areas to utilize property tax levies to enhance transit planning
and services on a multi-jurisdictional, regional scale.
• Property taxes are currently the only funding source that transit systems, including RTA’s
can use to generate revenue for annual operating expenses. State legislation will enable new
transportation-related fees, generated solely by users in a regional area, to be allocated
directly to RTAs for VMT-reducing services. The RTAs will use that revenue to pay for their
highest ridership routes, pay for expansion to routes with increasing ridership, and/or offer
more forms of transit services and infrastructure.
State Transportation Funding
• Currently, annual State funding for public transit operations average 14 percent of total
operations costs, ranging from a low of 5% in Des Moines to 37% in certain rural transit
operations. State funding should be increased to cover a higher percentage, at least 25%, for
transit systems with increasing ridership or ability to document VMT-reducing strategies.
However, these increased state funds should be added to, not displace local support (property
taxes). This will help transit agencies experiencing both an increase of riders and of higher
fuel and operating costs to serve the new riders.
•

The State of Iowa will be a funding partner to community-sponsored investments in transit
infrastructure improvements (commuter rail or other rapid transit, major passenger facility,
streetcars). The state will work with applicants of federal programs, such as the Small Starts
program, to identify sources of state matching funds well in advance of the federal funding
application submittal, in order to enhance the proposed transit project’s application within the
federal government’s competitive award process. The competitive federal process for Small
Starts and New Starts programs, the programs most often used for projects like rapid transit
or streetcars, gives favorable ratings to projects with solid non-federal support. This
encourages diversification of non-federal financial resources, such as state and local support.

•

Some federal and state transportation funding programs will be examined to identify their
potential role in helping to meet state VMT reduction and transit ridership goals. Applicable
H-16

programs will be modified to reward communities that are successfully reducing VMT and
making progress on policies that will lead towards VMT reduction.
Studies and Planning
The state will support studies and planning for new, efficient forms of transit to assist to achieve
an annual ridership increase of 100% by the year 2020. Expanding transit capacity will primarily
enhance, and not replace, the effectiveness of current transit services.
Bus Rapid Transit
• Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is an enhanced bus system that operates on exclusive transitways,
High Occupancy Vehicles (HOV) lanes, expressways, or ordinary streets in order to combine
the flexibility of buses with the efficiency of rail. By doing so, BRT operates at faster speeds,
provides greater service reliability and increases customer convenience. It also utilizes a
combination of advanced technologies, infrastructure, operational investments and land use
integration to provide significantly better service than traditional bus service.
•

Research indicates we could hit the target of doubling ridership and achieve it at a lower total
cost through conversion of existing transit services to enhanced Bus Rapid Transit lines
versus simply increasing service levels of the existing bus systems. 50-75% of the increase
in ridership could be achieved via Bus Rapid Transit with the balance coming from increases
in traditional fixed route bus services or other technologies as listed below.

•

BRT would be implemented in the four largest existing transit agencies—Iowa City, Des
Moines, Ames, and Cedar Rapids. Implementation of these studies and plans would involve
participation by the following entities:
The Iowa Department of Transportation will provide assistance to transit operators to
coordinate the development of possible rapid transit corridors.
○ Transit providers such as, the Des Moines Area Regional Transit Authority (or similar
regional body), will identify corridors that can accommodate rapid transit.
○ Municipalities will develop and implement policies that support and promote high
quality, dense developments at hubs and nodes along the identified rapid transit routes.
Bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure will be planned surrounding these hubs, along with
feeder bus routes that enable BRT riders to conveniently access the service.

○

•

Other new transit services will be studied and planned for inclusion in the 25%–50% increase
in transit ridership, not attributed to Bus Rapid Transit. Streetcars, trolleys, increased
vanpools, and commuter rail. These will be studied with cooperative participation of cities,
the Iowa DOT, transit providers, the Iowa Office of Energy Independence, and other
stakeholders.

Technical Assistance
Supplemental DOT staff resources will be approved to manage, evaluate, and provide technical
assistance associated with this new Transit Investment & VMT Reduction Strategy. Transit
agencies in Iowa’s nine urban areas shall be responsible for measuring and evaluating their
success at implementing these VMT reduction policy goals in cooperation with their
Metropolitan Planning Organization & DOT Office of Public Transit staff.

H-17

Transit providers will report to the Iowa DOT about progress on studies and planning activities
on at least an annual basis. This will enable DOT to provide technical assistance to other areas
about best practices, lessons learned, and possible funding strategies to advance new transit

Transit Marketing and Promotion
Transit agencies will be required to evaluate their marketing strategies for public transit and
report to the Iowa DOT about the effectiveness of current programs. The Iowa DOT will provide
advice and technical assistance on transit marketing and promotion.
A State of Iowa Transit Promotional Tax Credit Fund shall be established. The fund will award
tax credits to employers and other private sector interests who rely on the expansion of public
transit. This fund will provide grants to transit agencies to improve websites, signage,
advertisements, and other programs to encourage the use of public transit.
The state will support new fare pricing and marketing strategies that increase accessibility and
ridership for transit systems. Fare pricing strategies may include a supplemental appropriation
divided up to support transit agencies experiencing increased ridership growth and to reward the
agencies most successfully reducing Vehicle miles traveled. Three possible policies for fare
pricing are: 1) prevent agencies from increasing fares to cover their increasing operating
costs. 2) transition the agency to a reduced fare to enable ridership growth, and 3) upgrade
systems to allow people to more conveniently purchase bus passes to meet their needs.
Marketing strategies may include direct mail programs to targeted areas with convenient transit
service. These programs will illustrate the benefits of using transit, improve the image of the
transit agencies, give directions on how to use transit in that neighborhood, and how to use it for
daily needs.

This analysis examines the reductions in GHGs possible through a shift from personal motor
vehicles to transit, which emits fewer GHGs per passenger mile. The calculation of GHG
reductions must account both for the reduction in the number of private vehicle miles, but also
the partially offsetting increase in transit vehicle miles traveled. In addition to these direct
H-18

reductions from individuals’ shift of modes, two more long-term, indirect effects are estimated.
The shifting of trips from personal vehicles to transit can reduce the number of vehicles on the
road, and thus the amount of congestion in urban areas. Reducing congestion improves traffic
flow and can improve actual average vehicle fuel economy achieved. Studies also demonstrate
that increased transit service can help shape land-use patterns, enabling densities and proximity
to the center of urban areas. This results in reduced VMT by those living in transit corridors,
even if they never use transit.

City, and Waterloo.

Quantification Methods:
As noted above, this analysis examines direct and indirect reductions in GHGs resulting from
shifting people from personal motor vehicles to transit, which emits fewer GHGs per passengermile. The calculation of GHG reductions accounts for reduced private VMT and for the partially
offsetting increase in transit VMT., In addition to these direct VMT and emissions reductions
from individuals’ shifting modes, two more long-term, indirect effects are estimated: (1) the
shifting of trips from personal vehicles to transit can reduce the number of vehicles on the road,
and thus the amount of congestion in urban areas, and (2) reducing congestion improves traffic
flow and can reduce emissions and improve actual average fuel economy for all vehicles. As
also stated above, studies show that increased transit service can help shape land-use patterns,
allowing higher densities and proximity to the urban core. This results in reduced VMT even by
those who never use transit.
Direct quantification was undertaken for improvements in service frequency, reductions in travel
time, and the introduction of new and expansion of existing routes and services for bus, BRT,
commuter rail, and vanpools. Indirectly, the effects of a fare buy down and increased marketing
were reflected by selecting the highest elasticity from the literature.

H-19

Travel time improvements provide a well-documented means of improving transit service and
ridership. There is a direct benefit to riders because the improved service reduces the
“generalized cost” (time cost plus financial cost) of their trip. In addition to co-benefits in
improving service frequency, there is about a –0.4 elasticity for transit travel time
Service frequency increases ridership by existing riders and attracts new riders. Studies show
reductions in waiting time between vehicles are valued about two times more strongly on
average than actual travel time, so this mechanism can prove very effective. There is a reported
0.5 elasticity for service frequency alone (time between buses), while the aggregate impacts for
service improvements in time between vehicles and travel time have shown an elasticity of
between 0.6 and 1.0, incorporating the time and frequency impacts of aggregate increases in
service miles provided. The aggregate elasticity, using a value of 1.0, was applied to the total
increase in vehicle revenue service miles (the number of miles the vehicle was scheduled to
travel while operating and available to the public) to capture both factors together along with the
effects of a fare buy down and increased marketing efforts.
For service expansions and introduction, both the literature and a first-order statistical analysis
show a long-run elasticity for service expansion of between 0.6 and 1.0. An elasticity of 1.0 was
applied to service increases.
The costs of providing service were compiled for operating and capital costs from the National
Transit Database, subtracting out the Federal share of funding for these expenditures.
Savings to new riders for reducing the mileage driven in their vehicle were calculated using the
Internal Revenue Service mileage reimbursement rate (58.5 cents per mile), which accounts for
fuel costs, routine maintenance, repairs and depreciation. Savings from avoided infrastructure
costs were calculated for highways based on the VMT reduction from transit ridership.
Key Assumptions:
• Transit services can be expanded and introduced at the same average operating cost as
current services. A mix in transit modes provided—to include greater bus rapid transit,
commuter rail, and van pools—decreases the average net operating cost from the existing
almost purely bus service being offered.
•

New or improved services will be able to attract ridership in a manner consistent with service
improvements in other similar areas of the country (i.e., the Iowa transit market is not at
saturation). Recent fuel price increases provide a strong argument for this assumption.

Key Uncertainties
Funding availability for the provision of additional transit service.
Additional Benefits and Costs
The provision of transit service provides other more direct benefits and cost impacts. Most
importantly are travel time benefits that accrue to transit users, reduced air pollution, and
congestion relief that affect road users on parallel routes.

TLU-2. GHG Impacts for State and Local Capital Funding
(to be a model for climate-friendly development patterns)

Policy Description
The state of Iowa will be a leader in ensuring that the development of state facilities and that
state capital funding programs are helping to meet GHG-reduction goals. This includes
encouraging growth and development that reduces vehicle miles traveled (VMT).
State and local government buildings will be location-efficient with compact development
design, allowing easy access by multiple transportation modes and reducing reliance on the
automobile. This includes city halls, schools, libraries, community-sponsored attractions,
recreational centers, fire stations, police stations, and state agency offices. These locationefficient buildings will be in central business districts, established core business areas, or in
neighborhood commercial areas to be efficiently accessible.
Any state of Iowa office that serves the public in an urban area will be accessible by public
transportation within ¼ mile at a frequency rate that supports the needs of Iowans who visit and
need that facility. New buildings for state offices located in downtowns will be high density and
consider first floor retail to encourage mixed use and pedestrian orientation in downtowns. If
these locations are not possible, suburban locations will have good access for bicyclists,
pedestrians, and public transit.
Capital funding that Iowa administers will be a model for climate-friendly development. Some of
this funding is administered in the form of grants and loans; other capital funding goes directly to
local governments. This policy would improve coordination between state agencies, local and
regional governments to provide the technical assistance, incentives, and tools needed to reduce
VMT through smart growth implementation and linking infrastructure planning to land use
planning.
Existing infrastructure and community development funding sources will be reviewed to assess
their potential to facilitate smart growth and new funding programs will be developed to fill in
needed funding gaps. Comprehensive planning and site planning information from local and
regional governments will be submitted to the state to review specific state funding applications.
The state will significantly reduce capital investments that result in VMT increase. Technical
assistance and planning tools will be developed and disseminated in conjunction with the
realignment of state funding assistance and approval processes.
Capital funding that can enable GHG reductions from other sectors than transportation, such as
encouraging energy efficient buildings, will be included in this policy as well.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Establish and adopt a statewide “complete streets” policy that incorporates transit, bicycle
and pedestrian facilities in state, or state-facilitated and federally-funded transportation
H-22

projects as appropriate. The policy will require documentation of the consideration and
decision-making process of transit, bicycle and pedestrian components for all roadway
projects.
•

Establish a reliable source of capital funding for public transportation within the Iowa DOT
that is able to serve increased demands and opportunities for transit infrastructure.

•

Pass a state administrative policy regarding the location and accessibility of state offices and
agencies.

•

Transportation, water, and sewer funding will be targeted toward maintenance needs in
central locations and areas with the ability to reduce VMT through community design.

•

Development projects that are designed to serve higher density, more compact, pedestrianfriendly development will be prioritized for state capital funding.

•

The DOT will actively monitor and implement anticipated federal legislation regarding the
consideration of GHG impacts of transportation projects. The DOT will evaluate tools and
processes to evaluate GHG impacts and implement in the transportation planning process.

Timing:
2009: Adopt complete streets policy, compilation of maintenance needs of infrastructure in
central locations and areas with the ability to reduce VMT through community design, compile
data on existing state capital funding programs, begin technical assistance and education to
stakeholders and applicants for state funding.
2010: New infrastructure policy applied to selected state capital funding, create a state-level
source of capital funding for public transportation, state NEPA policy development, pass state
administrative policy on location of state facilities, begin applying community design principles
to state or state-administered federal capital funding.
2010–2020: Full Implementation
Parties Involved: Department of Transportation, Department of Management, Department of
Administrative Services, Iowa Finance Authority, the Department of Economic Development,
the Department of Natural Resources, transit agencies, and local governments. Every state
agency will be complying with the policy relating to the location of offices.
Implementation Mechanisms
Locating and Expanding State Facilities—For purposes of this policy, state facilities will be
defined as any property owned or leased by the state or used primarily pursuant to a written
agreement on behalf of the state that derives at least 50% of its annual funding from the state.
The state will develop a new approach to siting and expanding state facilities. A State Facilities
Plan will be created to project short-term and long-term needs of state facilities. The plan will
emphasize principles of location-efficient buildings, and designation to Priority Growth Areas as
referenced in the Smart Growth Policy. An existing state facility that meets the principles of this
policy will not be closed or moved outside of the Priority Growth Area.

H-23

Locating or Expanding other Public/Civic Buildings—Upon consideration of expanding public
services or needing an improved building, local governments will be encouraged to redevelop
and use any surrounding under-utilized property as a priority. State incentives and technical
assistance will be provided to assist in preservation of historically significant public buildings.
The state will enact low-interest rates on bonds to support utilization of existing buildings, infill
sites, historic structures, and location-efficient developments to serve the public.
Schools—For school districts proposing new school sites, a standard lot size based on needs per
pupil will be evaluated and recommended by the Department of Education and Office of
Community Investment to prevent sprawling consumption of land and auto-dependence. Schools
will be rewarded for re-using and redeveloping existing school sites.
Alternative Financing Mechanisms—Many local governments are overly reliant on the property
tax and seeking new revenue streams for capital expenses. Any new local revenue streams
authorized by state legislation will require that capital funding for infrastructure or development
will primarily be used for efficient land use patterns, infill, and transportation projects that
support VMT reduction. Impact fees will be authorized by the General Assembly, directed to
improve the already developed areas and fund climate-friendly development patterns.

TLU-4. Support Passenger Rail Service in Iowa

Policy Description
Increasing passenger rail will reduce single occupant vehicle travel which reduces emissions of
pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHG). The following is from the report “Vision for the
Future—U.S. Intercity Passenger Rail Network Through 2050” prepared by the Passenger Rail
Working Group:
“Traveling by public transportation is less carbon intensive than traveling in a single occupant vehicle.
Partially or fully loaded rail coaches are more environmentally friendly than lower occupancy single
vehicles. The average intercity passenger train produces 60 percent fewer CO2 emissions per
passenger-mile than the average auto and half the GHG emissions of an airplane.”1

Iowa is currently served by two Amtrak long distance routes. The California Zephyr runs eastwest through southern Iowa from Omaha to Burlington and the Southwest Chief cuts across the
southeastern tip of Iowa through Fort Madison. Total ridership on these routes in FY 2006 was
61,377 which is a 33% increase from FY 2002. These long-distance routes are important to
connect Iowa with the rest of the nation and should continue.
As part of this policy option, the expansion of rail between the Quad Cities and Iowa City should
also be supported along with the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative
The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) has participated in a study of the development of
a Midwest Regional Rail System which would provide high-speed service (up to 79 mph) across
Iowa from Omaha to the Quad-Cities ultimately connecting with Chicago. This service would
provide an estimated user benefit to Iowa of $500 to $700 million. This system would require a
significant investment to upgrade track and an operational subsidy for the first few years of
service.
The DOT is now partnering with Amtrak to study regional passenger service in Iowa. Initial
feasibility studies have been completed for service from Chicago to Dubuque and Chicago to the
Quad Cities. Studies are underway to look at extending the Chicago to Quad Cities service on to
Iowa City and then on to Des Moines. Estimated ridership for the Chicago to Dubuque service is
74,500 and would require capital upgrades (primarily in Illinois) and an annual operating subsidy
of $2.9 million. Estimated ridership for the Chicago to Quad Cities service is 102,700 and would
require capital upgrades (primarily in Illinois) and an annual operating subsidy of $6 million.
The DOT, along with other interested partners and agencies, will develop and implement a
statewide passenger rail system in Iowa. This will involve identifying and implementing funding
to support capital and operating costs. The plan will identify a phased implementation of service
and appropriate funding support based on type of service provided (i.e. long-distance vs. regional
vs. commuter service). In the short-term this effort should result in regional passenger rail

service from Chicago to Dubuque and from Chicago to the Quad Cities to Iowa City. In the longterm, this will result in statewide passenger rail service consistent with yet to be developed longrange passenger rail plans.
Policy Design
Goal Levels: Establish a statewide passenger rail system in Iowa to supplement existing longdistance service and that provides connections to other modes of transportation.
Timing:
By 2010, the Iowa Department of Transportation and other interested parties and agencies will:
•

Support the initiation and development of passenger rail feasibility studies.

•

Develop and implement education, marketing, and promotion activities that support
passenger rail service.

•

Develop a Passenger Rail Advisory Committee.

•

Identify and seek state funding for passenger rail capital and operating assistance.

•

Seek federal funding to support passenger rail service.

•

Develop a long-range passenger rail plan that identifies both short-term and long-term
passenger rail service in Iowa along with an implementation strategy.

By 2012, the Iowa Department of Transportation and other interested parties and agencies will:
•

Support implementation of regional rail service from Chicago to Dubuque and Chicago to the
Quad Cities and on to Iowa City/Cedar Rapids and Des Moines by 2012.

•

Work with local governments through the planning process to link passenger rail service with
other modes of transportation including public transit, intercity bus service, bicycle,
pedestrian, and aviation.

•

Support implementation of other regional service including service extending from Des
Moines to Omaha as deemed feasible and consistent with the passenger rail plan.

By 2015, the Iowa Department of Transportation and other interested parties and agencies will:
•

Support implementation of other regional service including service extending from Des
Moines to Omaha as deemed feasible and consistent with the passenger rail plan.

By 2030, the Iowa Department of Transportation, in coordination with other interested parties,
will:
•

Support full implementation of passenger rail service as envisioned in the passenger rail plan,
and connect all metropolitan areas of the state by 2030.

•

Support higher-speed service that results in significant ridership.

looking at all periods of cumulative effects from 2010-2024 or further onwards. Additionally,
federal funding which has recently been made available through the Rail Safety Improvement

Quantification Methods:
Potential GHG reductions are calculated from reductions in modal shift from auto to inter-city
rail due to the installation of new inter-city passenger rail services: Chicago- Quad Cities, Quad
Cities-Iowa City, Iowa City-Des Moines, Des Moines-Omaha, and Chicago–Dubuque service.
Rail ridership generated is considered to be shifted from personal vehicles, with an assumed
vehicle occupancy of 1.78 in personal vehicles for diverted trips. The increase in ridership after
the initial feasibility results is assumed to be growing at the same rate as population increase.
Annual costs were calculated using operating and capital expenses as given in the above sources,
with capital costs evenly distributed over the investment phase. The savings from avoided
personal vehicle costs were calculated on a $0.505/mile average mileage cost based on current
U.S. Internal Revenue Service reimbursement guidance adjusted for improving fuel economy,
and assumed an average auto occupancy of 1.78 (NHTS 2001). Locomotive emissions were
calculated based on 772 passenger-miles/gallon.2
Key Assumptions:
Vehicles occupancy was assumed to be 1.78 for personal vehicles. This number was taken from
2000 U.S. Census for average vehicle occupancy and based upon the National Personal
Transportation Survey.3
The savings from avoided personal vehicle costs were calculated on a $0.505/mile average
mileage cost. This number was based upon the Internal Revenue Service’s standard mileage
rates for the use of a car.4
Key Uncertainties
Funding availability for the provision of additional passenger rail service is a significant
uncertainty.
Initial implementation of regional rail service in Iowa is dependent on the state of Illinois and
their funding of passenger rail service to Iowa’s border. At this time, Illinois has not funded this
service and there is some uncertainty that this will happen within the assumed schedule of this
strategy.
Implementation of expanded passenger rail service is dependent on a significantly expanded
federal funding program (and Iowa successfully securing federal funding) and the establishment
of sustainable state funding in Iowa.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Passenger rail service provides additional benefits and cost impacts, by improving the mobility
of the local populations, reducing emissions and thereby increasing health benefits, and by

TLU-5a. Adopt Best Workplaces for Commuters in Iowa

Policy Description
According to the 2001 National Household Travel Survey, 27% of total vehicle miles traveled
(VMT) to and from work are equivalent to 734 billion miles nationally. Assuming that same
percentage applies to Iowa, more than 8.5 billion miles of travel in 2006 was from Iowans going
to and from work. Of those trips, 78% were done by single occupant vehicles (2000 U.S.
Census).
Many actions can be taken to reduce single-occupant vehicle commuting. These include
increasing the number of employees that telework, carpool, vanpool, ride transit, ride bicycles,
and walk. In May, 2001, a new government-industry partnership was created and sponsored by
the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States Department of
Transportation (DOT)titled “Best Workplaces for Commuters.” This program recognizes
employers and districts (e.g. downtown districts, malls, business parks) that subsidize employee
transit/vanpool use, implement telework programs, and/or other activities that reduce traffic and
air pollution. Benefits of designation include public recognition, training, access to Web-based
tools, one-on-one technical assistance, and networking opportunities. A 2005 survey of program
participants found that programs that included a comprehensive benefits package (i.e. guaranteed
ride home, on-site services, financial incentives, etc.) resulted in a 15% reduction of trips,
pollutants, and fuel consumption. More information is available at www.bestworkplaces.org.
The state of Iowa and interested organizations should take action to reduce single-occupant
vehicle commuting by encouraging and incentivizing participation in activities such as Best
Workplaces for Commuters.
Policy Design
Goal Levels: Major employers and districts in all nine of Iowa’s metropolitan areas will be
designated as ‘Best Workplaces for Commuters.’
Timing:
By 2012, the state of Iowa and other interested parties will:
•

Educate, inform, and market to employers and communities in Iowa’s metropolitan areas
regarding the Best Workplaces for Commuters program.

•

Identify existing funding programs and make funding available to assist employers and
commuters to take actions that will assist qualifying for designation (i.e. funding for van
pools, subsidization of transit fees, etc.).

•

Identify and implement public incentives (e.g., tax credits, deductions, etc.) to support
actions that will assist qualifying for designation (i.e., funding for van pools, subsidizing
transit fees, etc.).

H-31

•

Evaluate opportunities to expand the goal level beyond Iowa’s metropolitan areas into
smaller communities and rural areas.

Parties Involved: Local governments, state agencies, environmental organizations, United
States EPA, United States DOT, metropolitan planning organizations, local governments,
chambers, Iowa Chamber Alliance, Iowa League of Cities, transit providers, Transportation
Management Associations, major employers, downtown development groups, etc.
Implementation Mechanisms
Enact legislation to require, if feasible, all employers in the counties listed in the quantification
methods section to, below, offer commuter benefits programs if they have more than 100
employees at an individual work site and normally begin office hours between 6:00 and 9:00 am.
Compliance with this requirement could be coordinated through the Iowa Department of
Transportation or other agency as appropriate. Information, training and outreach should be
provided to major employers to assist them in developing commuter benefits programs.
A growing number of Iowa’s citizens are employed in knowledge-based work. Most of these
individuals are daily commuters relying primarily on single-occupied vehicles as the primary
method of getting to work. By focusing on the commuting patterns of these knowledge workers,
Iowa will examine the opportunity to implement advanced applications of telecommunications
infrastructure to connect its communities to reduce vehicle miles traveled and predictably alter
traffic patterns. More details on this method of reducing VMT are provided in the policy option
TLU-5b, Distributed Workplace Model.
Related Policies/Program in Place
Vanpooling and ridesharing programs are offered in various locations throughout the state, such
as through Des Moines Area Rapid Transit (DART) rideshare.

It is assumed that the “best workplaces for commuters” programs are put in place with employers
with 100 more employees. This represents about 235,000 employees statewide, in 17 counties.
(Note that 3 of the original 20 counties included in the analysis had no qualifying employers).
Using data from the Worksite Trip Reduction Model and Manual, it was estimated that commute
trip programs would reduce vehicle work trips by about 5% for effected employers. Based on
feedback from the TLU Subcommittee, these estimates were adjusted to an assumed reduction in
work trip VMT by 2% in Polk, Dallas, and Warren Counties, and by 5% in the other counties.
For 2004/2005 total annual VMT reduced by these programs was about 45 million miles (off of a
total VMT baseline of about 31,570 million miles). From 2004/2005, the forecast of affected
employees increased at the same rate as population. These mile reductions were all from light
duty vehicle miles listed in the Iowa GHG Inventory and Projections, and emissions reductions
were calculated based on the Iowa GHG Inventory and Projections.
Key Assumptions:
Assumes the programs are in place beginning in 2012. Assumes these programs are put in place
with employers with 100 or more employees by 2012. This represents about 235,000 employees
statewide working for 671 employers in 17 counties. Assumes programs reduce employee trip
to/from work VMT by 2% in Polk, Dallas, and Warren Counties, and by 5% in the other counties.
Assumes the number of effected employees increases at the same rate as population is forecast to
increase. Assumes 240 commute days per year at an average one-way commute distance of 10.7
miles. Assumes annual program administration cost of $2,600 per employer, plus commute
benefits of $30 per month per employee who commutes to work using an alternative mode, based
on Best Workplaces For Commuters website (www.bestworkplaces.org/). Benefits to employers
include reduced parking costs. The analysis did not consider any foregone state and federal tax
revenue.

TLU-5b. Distributed Workplace Model

Policy Description
A growing number of Iowa's citizens are employed in knowledge-based work. Most of these
individuals are daily commuters relying primarily on single occupied vehicles as the primary
method of getting to work. By focusing on the commuting patterns of these knowledge workers,
Iowa will examine the opportunity to implement advanced telecommunications applications and
infrastructure to connect its communities reducing vehicle miles traveled and predictably altering
traffic patterns. Workforce deployment is an initial focus of this initiative, seeking to develop
more community-located employment opportunities. Additionally, this approach will further
enhance the viability of the TLU-1, Smart Growth Bundle.
Distributed workplace is a community work model. Moving beyond “work from home” as the
primary methodology of remotely supporting employees, networks of community-based multilocation work centers will enhance access for both employers and employees. It is anticipated
that each work center will accommodate a cluster of employees (200 to 1000) working for
multiple employers, such as local state and federal governments, as well as private employers
such as financial and insurance companies. A typical employer will have 15 to more than 100
employees in any given work center based upon their geographic hiring patterns. Further study
of the potential for these issues to benefit the State of Iowa should be considered.
A network of work centers is a progression in the use of telecommunications infrastructure. It
will more effectively reduce vehicle miles traveled and gasoline consumed than current
approaches. In addition, there are economic reasons to develop distributed work centers such as
extending employment opportunities to part-time working parents, students and individuals with
disabilities. Locating work centers in local communities will improve employee productivity and
employers' abilities to attract and retain quality employees.
The multi-location, distributed workplace model takes advantage of the changing nature of work
and balances workforce deployment with security and management oversight while enabling
employees to access a greater number of jobs from “within” their local communities without
long commutes.
The falling costs of converged services networks (voice, data and video) and enhanced
collaborative and interactive systems permit a greater number of knowledge-based employees to
work from work centers located closer to their place of residence.
By using networked offices to reduce commuting distances for some, the overall reduction in
vehicle miles traveled (VMT) mitigates congestion for the benefit the rest of the highway users.
The distributed multi-location work centers can reduce the impact of emergency evacuations and
vastly improve emergency preparedness and continuity of operations, by providing for a more
dispersed workforce and an expanded web of the telecommunications infrastructure, lessening
the impact if any one facility is incapacitated or needs to be evacuated.

H-36

These distributed workplace networks will achieve economies of scale and create a secure,
scalable platform for rapid geographic expansion. Focus on telecommunications resources will
establish the 21st century building blocks for ongoing distance learning and acceleration in the
use of telemedicine.
Every center will be unique based upon each community's individual requirements.
The initial focus on workforce deployment:
•

Reduces vehicle miles traveled, emissions, consumption of gasoline, and transportation
congestion.

•

Converts gasoline dollars into local economy dollars.

•

Engages the knowledge-based workforce with a greater number of potential employers,
improving employment opportunities by lowering the cost of access.

The distributed workplace model is a network of work centers supporting a cluster of employees
working for multiple employers. Each employer in the work center will have dedicated offices
for their employees. All work centers will be networked together and to each employer’s primary
facilities. A technical staff will provide support for the network and services at each work center.
Communities and employers will work together to examine optimal commercial real estate
recommendations. This will include re-use of employers’ underutilized space and available
commercial real estate opportunities based upon capacity and location requirements.
The target client groups are identified as follows:
•

Local, state, and federal employers in selected major metropolitan statistical areas (MSA):
Defined as a U.S. Government classification for a free-standing urban population center with
a population of at least 50,000 and a total MSA population of 100,000 or more.)

•

Enterprise employers (non-retail, non-manufacturing) i.e. law firms, financial services,
insurance and technology companies, etc.

•

Interactive, web-enabled call center services.

•

Distributed interactive seminars, training, and distance education.

Policy Design
Goal Levels: Based on a survey of major employers in Iowa's nine metropolitan statistical areas,
findings on their geographic hiring patterns and their interests in this approach, density
distribution models will be constructed to identify the optimal number and locations for
networked work centers. One or more pilot project initiative(s) will be developed with an
objective of 10 to 20 % deployment for each participating employer.
Each pilot project initiative will apply for state and government financial support from a variety
of funding sectors, including transportation mitigation, environment improvement, energy
conservation and emergency preparedness. Iowa's leadership and pro-active actions in this area

H-37

will improve the opportunity for funding subsidies for pilot initiatives. Initial business proposals
will examine the feasibility of public-private partnerships.
Timing:
• By 2009 all nine metropolitan statistical areas will be surveyed and potential multi-location
networks identified.
•

By 2010 applicable funding programs will be identified and grants proposal will be
submitted.

•

By 2011 the first pilot initiative(s) will commence with transition and build out completed by
2013.

•

By 2012 legislative and economic incentives will be drafted for continuation of pilot
initiatives and expansion to include development in the most feasible rural communities.

•

By 2013 academic and medical organizations will be approached to examine the feasibility
of incorporating and coordinating distance learning and telemedicine services.

Parties Involved: Major employers, including state government, local governments, chambers
of commerce, economic development groups, commercial developers, technology companies,
Iowa DOT, USDOT, EPA, USDA, and Homeland Security all represent potential stakeholders.
Implementation Mechanisms
Establish a core-planning group to develop and/or acquire the necessary analytic tools while
beginning presentations and conducting surveys in target metropolitan communities to determine
public opinion on the utilization of these work centers.
The key areas to succeed in creating and testing the viability of a multi-location metropolitan
network of work centers are policy, partners, and projects.
Policy—Develop support from Federal, State and Local Legislative and Administrative groups
to fund and/or create incentives for initial pilot projects.
Partners—Solicit technology, real estate and service providers as potential public-private
partners:
•

To develop technology solution proposals for communities and tenant organizations.

•

To plan, implement and maintain initial pilot project networks.

•

To provide a source of operating capital for start up operations.

Projects—Work with federal, regional and local stakeholders on the formation of core
stakeholder groups for specific pilot projects. Investigate requirements and procedures for
establishing public-private partnerships.

TLU-6. Light-Duty Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Incentives

Policy Description
Iowa can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by improving the fuel economy of the light duty
vehicle fleet. The first step is to charge a state agency with tracking the fuel economy of Iowa’s
entire fleet. Once a baseline for Iowa’s fuel economy is established, the state could then establish
goals for improving the fuel economy of the entire fleet as a basis for reducing GHG emissions.
For example, if the current fuel economy is 20 miles per gallon (mpg), goals of 21 mpg by 2012
and 25 mpg by 2020 could be adopted. All other things being equal, increasing fuel economy
from 20 mpg to 25 mpg would reduce fuel consumption and the resulting greenhouse gases by
20%. Further reductions beyond 2020 are also likely. Iowa could establish a goal of 40 to 200
mpg by 2050, reflecting the climate council’s goals of reducing GHG emissions by 50% to 90%.
Policy options to meet a goal of higher fuel economy include consumer education about vehicle
purchases, monetary incentives through a feebate system or tax credits, investments in a plug-in
hybrid infrastructure, and a state policy for scrapping older vehicles that do not have good fuel
economy. Information about vehicle fuel economy and consumer benefits of higher fuel
economy are available at www.fueleconomy.gov. As the federal agencies responsible for that
Web site explain, “The difference between a car that gets 20 mpg and one that gets 30 mpg
amounts to $775/year (assuming 15,000 miles of driving annually and a fuel cost of $3.10).”
This option includes several policies and programs to encourage the purchase of low GHG
emission vehicles through monetary and convenience rewards and incentives throughout the
state.
•

Feebates—This is a study option rather than an implementation option. The state would
participate in a multi-state study of the feasibility and effectiveness of a regional feebate
system with other midwestern states.

•

Tax Credits for Low-GHG Vehicles—Amend the current federal income tax credit program
for hybrid, alternative fuel, and low-emission vehicles so that it continues in its present form
beyond 2010. The state will initiate an income tax program to encourage consumer purchases
of fuel efficient vehicles. For example, within a year of a low GHG vehicle coming onto the
market, a consumer could purchase that vehicle and receive a $1,000 tax credit. The
incentives should keep pace with the market. The state will develop the standards for which
the tax credits will be given to low emission vehicles. Establishing a state standard will
insure that the performance of the vehicle is the basis for the incentive, not individual vehicle
models. The program needs to be responsive to changing market conditions and product
development.

•

Operating Incentives for Low-GHG Vehicles—Provide for preferential access and
infrastructure for alternative fuel vehicles (E10, E85, natural gas, propane, 100% electric,
others) such as state-controlled highways and local-government controlled parking.

H-40

•

Vehicle Registration Fees —Add a new criteria in the collection of annual vehicle
registration fees that applies increased fees for high emitting vehicles and a reduced fee for
low emitting vehicles. Overall the results of the revenue collection amount would be the
same.

Policy Design
Goals/Timing: Reduce GHG emissions by improving the fuel economy of the light duty vehicle
fleet in the State of Iowa by 20% by 2012, 100% by 2020, and 250% or more by 2050.
Implementation to start on January 1, 2010.
Parties Involved: Iowa Department of Transportation, Iowa Department of Revenue, County
Treasurers, Iowa Automobile Dealers Association, and Iowa Independent Automobile Dealers
Association.
Implementation Mechanisms
The proposed policies and programs in this option will need to be passed through the legislative
process and implemented by state and local government agencies in partnership with affected
parties.
Related Policies/Program in Place
While feebates are set as a new proposal, they are not completely unlike the application of
existing taxes such as vehicle sales tax and gas guzzler tax. The difference is the method of
calculation. In the case of feebates, the calculation will be on vehicle ‘green rating’ drawing on
the greenhouse gas scores for vehicles as determined by the U.S. EPA
(http://www.epa.gov/greenvehicle/).
Some European countries have implemented feebate programs, and other U.S. states are
considering both the rebate portion and the “gas guzzler tax” elements of feebate type programs.
In 2007, Canada introduced the “Vehicle Efficiency Incentive (VEI) program, which took effect
in March 2007. The program includes both a rebate and a tax component.
Recently, the State of North Carolina Climate Action Policy Advisory Group (CAPAG)
recommended that the state charge a sliding scale of fees and rebates for new light duty vehicles
based on their emissions of greenhouse gases and/or other measures of a vehicle’s efficiency
technologies. In addition, the State of South Carolina Climate, Energy, and Commerce Advisory
Committee (CECAC) decided that a reduced or free vehicle registration would not provide an
effective incentive because of the low level of existing fees. The CECAC also evaluated the
option of a feebate, and decided not to pursue such a policy. The CECAC did call for the state of
South Carolina to maintain and enhance the already existing state tax rebates and state income
tax credits for low-GHG emission vehicles.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Data Sources:
The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) conducted a review of the most relevant research and
analysis on feebate proposals with the following three findings:
H-41

1. There has been significant conceptual development of the feebate idea, especially at the
national level;
2. There is a need for a greater understanding of potential benefits and costs of state-level and
multi-state coordinated feebate programs; and
3. There has not been sufficient pilot testing of feebate programs in the United States to provide
implementation experience.
CCS assessed recent studies of potential GHG emission reductions from a national feebate
program based on modeling work conducted by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (ORNL). CCS also reviewed other relevant recent studies and analyses of
feebates conducted by the Canadian government, the State of California, and the Public Interest
Research Group (PIRG). The ORNL and other studies assume a national feebate rate high
enough to produce responses from both consumers and manufacturers. ORNL’s estimate of the
national potential for reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is approximately 11 MMtCO2e in
2010 and 66 MMtCO2e in 2020.
Some attempts have recently been made to estimate the GHG emissions reduction potential from
individual state feebate programs, including programs proposed for the states of Arizona and
California. For example, a recent PIRG analysis suggests that a single state feebate program for
Arizona would result in an estimated 0.1 MMtCO2e GHG emissions reductions in 2020.
These recent estimates of the potential impacts of individual state programs are contingent upon
assumptions and analytical methods that have not undergone thorough peer review. Therefore,
the results of these analyses are preliminary and should be interpreted with some caution. Further
analysis and study of the potential benefits and costs of individual state and multi-state feebate
programs would greatly increase confidence in projected results.
Quantification Methods:
In order to quantify the GHG reductions and fuel savings that would result from implementation
of TLU-6 for the State of Iowa, CCS used the Vehicle Energy and Greenhouse Gas Assessment
Tool (VEGA Tool). The VEGA Tool was developed by the CCS team to support its role in the
Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council process in conducting analysis of various policies
affecting GHG emissions from the on-road transportation sector.
Figure H-1 illustrates schematically how the VEGA Tool operates. The grey boxes represent the
inputs required: state GHG Inventory and Forecast data, existing actions, recent actions, and the
policy options to be analyzed.

The tool helps the analyst quantify the existing actions, recent actions, and policy options by
translating them into three aspects of on-road transport that affect on-road vehicle emissions of
greenhouse gases:
•

Fleet Characteristics: What types of vehicles are being driven
Fuel Economy: The average miles per gallon for each model year and vehicle class
○ Vehicle Class Distribution: The portion of the vehicle fleet falling into each of the 28
vehicle classes defined by the Mobile6 model (light-duty gas vehicles, light-duty gas
trucks – type 1)
○ Fleet Turnover Rate: The rate at which new cars are introduced and older cars are retired
from the vehicle fleet
Fuel Characteristics: What types of fuel are these vehicles using

○

•

Fuels Used
○ Emission Rates of Fuels: How much greenhouse gas is emitted per unit of fuel
Travel Habits (VMT): How much are the vehicles being driven
○

•

The above parameters, also illustrated in Figure H-2 can be adjusted by the analyst to best reflect
a given action or policy option. The VEGA Tool then combines these parameters to estimate
what the greenhouse gas emissions would be if the policy option is implemented.

Policy TLU-6 affected the fuel economy parameter. It was assumed that this improvement would
be phased in linearly starting with Model Year (MY) 2010 and reaching intermediate targets of
20% improvement for MY 2012 vehicles, 100% improvement for MY 2020 vehicles, and at least
250% improvement for MY 2050 vehicles. In other words, it was assumed that the average fuel
economy of MY 2020 vehicles would be 100% higher than what they would have been had
TLU-6 not been implemented. Table H-1 shows specifically the percent improvement to average
fuel economy of the light-duty fleet per Model Year which was assumed to result from
implementation of TLU-6. Fuel economy improvements were calculated for each vehicle class
and model year affected by the policy.

Once all of the parameters have been defined, the tool uses the following general methodology to
estimate fuel savings and GHG reductions. The vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and fuel economy
(mpg) are combined to estimate fuel consumption (gallons). The difference between fuel
consumption under baseline and policy option conditions is the estimated change in fuel
consumption that would result from implementation of the policy option. The estimated change
in fuel consumption is translated into an estimated change in greenhouse gas emissions.
Key Assumptions:
The following key assumptions were made in quantification of TLU-6:
•

The baseline fuel consumption assumed that the new federal CAFE standards were in effect.

•

It was assumed that the policy would affect all light-duty vehicles and trucks.

•

It was assumed that the policy would not change the vehicle class distribution (i.e. the
relative number of gas vehicles, diesel vehicles, gas trucks, and diesel trucks), but would
rather change the specific makes and models purchased within each class.

•

It was assumed during this analysis that the fuels used (predominantly gasoline and diesel)
remained consistent with Iowa’s Inventory and Forecast of GHG Emissions, Chapter 2.

•

The carbon content for the fuels used in this analysis (predominantly gasoline and diesel)
remained consistent with Iowa’s Inventory and Forecast of GHG emissions (Chapter 2), and

H-45

was assumed to be consistent with the EPA estimate for CO2 emissions of 19.4
pounds/gallon for gasoline and 22.2 pounds/gallon for diesel.5
Key Uncertainties
Consumer reaction to incentive programs varies.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Incentive programs that significantly reduce GHG emissions through vehicle fuel efficiency also
have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of transportation fuel consumed from
imported sources, thus reducing the dependency of the United States on foreign sources.
Feasibility Issues
Vehicle efficiency incentive programs may be affected by the availability of vehicles in the
marketplace by the limited number of automobile manufacturing firms.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Supermajority (Vote: 13–3).
Barriers to Consensus
Concerns were raised surrounding vehicle registration fees. Additionally, the ICCAC wanted the
policy option to be clear in its goal of reducing GHG emissions and that this policy option (TLU6) should not interfere with the adoption of alternative fuels that may get less MPG but which
have the benefit of lower GHG emissions.

TLU-7a. Fuel Efficient Operations for Light-Duty Vehicles:
Fuel Efficient Replacement Tires Program

Policy Description
Improve the fuel economy of the light-duty vehicle (LDV) fleet by setting minimum energy
efficiency standards for replacement tires and requiring that greater information about lowrolling resistance (LRR) replacement tires, including all season/all weather LRR tires, be made
available to consumers at the point of sale. Snow and mud LRR tires are currently available and
tire manufacturers such as Michelin are currently researching and developing fuel efficient all
weather replacement tires.
Vehicle manufacturers currently use LRR tires on some new vehicles, but they are not easily
available to consumers as replacement tires. When installing original equipment tires, carmakers
sometimes use LRR tires to meet federal corporate automobile fuel economy standards (CAFE).
When replacing the original equipment tires, consumers often purchase less fuel-efficient and
potentially more costly tires (depending on annual vehicle miles traveled [VMT]). Currently, tire
manufacturers and tire retailers are not required to provide information about the fuel efficiency
of replacement tires.
An appropriate state agency would initiate a fuel efficient tire replacement program. The
program would include consumer education, product labeling, and minimum standards elements.
These programs would be developed under a rule development process. All programs would
incorporate the best scientific information, including the test results of tires conducted by the tire
manufacturers, the Tire Industry Association, and the National Academy of Sciences and others.
Policy Design
This policy is designed to encourage consumer choice and to set an example by state
government.
Goal Levels: Establish voluntary energy efficiency standards that achieve an average 4% gain in
fuel economy.
Timing: By January 1, 2010 the state or appropriate agency would initiate a fuel efficient tire
replacement program for the state fleet if all season/all weather tires are available and are
incorporated into legislatively approved rental rates, establish voluntary energy efficiency
standards for replacement tires, and develop a marketing program for fuel efficient replacement
tires.
By January 1, 2012 the state or appropriate agency would ensure that a proportion of tires
replaced on state-owned and -leased vehicles will be LRR tires (if they are available for the
vehicle type and are rated for all season/all weather service) and would consider legislation or
administrative regulation to set LRR standards for tires with mandatory manufacture labeling.

H-47

By January 1, 2015 the state or appropriate agency would ensure that 50% of all tires sold to
consumers in the state of Iowa will be LRR tires. This percent of market penetration would
increase to 100% of all tires sold to consumers in the state of Iowa will be LRR tires by 2020.
Parties Involved: Iowa Department of Transportation, Iowa Department of Natural Resources,
Iowa Energy Center, LRR manufacturers, and tire distributors.
Implementation Mechanisms
The program would include consideration of the technical feasibility and cost of such a program,
the relationship between tire fuel efficiency and tire safety, potential effects upon tire life, and
impacts on the potential for tire recycling. In addition, the program may determine it necessary to
exempt certain classes of tires that sell in low volumes, including specialty and high performance
tires.
The minimum standard is likely to be less stringent than the energy efficiency of original
equipment tires. Such a regulation would improve the fuel efficiency of the overall LDV fleet,
but not necessarily the fuel efficiency of all tires since consumers would still make choices in the
marketplace. While the replacement tires purchased in the future would be on average more fuel
efficient than those historically purchased, they are not likely to be as fuel efficient as the tires
included as original equipment by the automobile manufacturers. Still this would provide an
increase in fuel economy over what have traditionally been purchased as replacement tires.
Information and Education: Provide information to the general public and commercial
businesses (i.e., taxi and food delivery services) that use light-duty vehicles for daily business
that the improved fuel efficiency is directly related to the decreased rolling resistance of a
vehicle’s tires. Information on the potential annual costs savings using LRR tires would also be
provided. For example, a car averaging 15,000 miles per year would have annual fuel savings
estimated to be $124. A chart of recommended tire models would be included with information
on product labeling and minimum standards elements. Best scientific information including the
results from tests of tires conducted by the tire manufacturers, the California Energy
Commission, and the National Academy of Sciences would be reviewed and incorporated.
The manufacturers of the LRR tires would be contacted to encourage the promotion of their
relevant products through regional newspaper and television advertising. The producers of LRRs
may freely provide promotional materials.
Promotion and Marketing:
State Lead by Example: The state will lead by example by initiating a fuel efficient tire
replacement program. This would include all weather fuel efficient tires and would require
legislative approval for rental rates for vehicles, both owned and leased.
Over time, all state fleet tires in need of replacement will be changed to LRR tires, if available
for the vehicle type and season.
Voluntary LRR Standards: Establish voluntary LRR standards that achieve an average 4.0%
gain in fuel economy.

H-48

Encourage Procurement of LRR Tires:
Encourage local/county governments to act consistently with and support state procurement on
their behalf.
Encourage federal agencies located within the state to act accordingly with and support state
actions.
Encourage businesses that depend on vehicles to conduct daily business to act accordingly with
and support state actions.
Marketing Program: Develop a marketing program with tire dealers and consumers to
encourage the purchase of LRR tires. This effort might include a voluntary labeling program for
tire fuel efficiency.
University Research: Encourage the Iowa university system to conduct research on alternative
non-combustible applications for used tires.
Web Site: All state-supported programs would have dedicated detailed web sites. In addition to
information and materials, program participation by the various governmental agencies and
individual businesses (i.e., success stories) would also be documented and extolled.
Technical Assistance: Contact the LRR manufacturers and tire distributors to coordinate
objectives and obtain technical support for outreach materials.
Funding Mechanisms and/or Incentives: Replacement of tires on state fleet vehicles is already
budgeted through the Iowa DOT annual funding processes.
Voluntary and or Negotiated Agreements: Work with the manufactures and affected parties to
achieve objectives with flexibility of the timelines.
Codes and Standards: The state of California and Germany have developed substantial
information pertaining to LRR tires due to legislative actions that require tires to be replaced
with more efficient ones. Associated documentation identifies testing methods and LRR
standards. The appropriate state agency can review the information and establish suitable Iowa
standards.
Pilots and Demonstrations: Coordinate with product developers to help them promote their
technologies.
Reporting: The state will develop a system for tracking purposes so that the state can eventually
determine the turnover to LRR tires and the benefits achieved from the conversion. A simple
tracking system would be established relatively easily by contacting the primary tire distributors
of the major Iowa cities on an annual basis and estimates can be gathered from their inventories.
Enforcement: No enforcement actions are necessary initially when the program is instituted as a
voluntary program. After the mandatory labeling comes into effect, spot checks at the primary
tire distributors in the main Iowa cities would be conducted annually by the county health
departments and the state staffs.
H-49

Related Policies/Program in Place
In October of 2003, the state of California adopted the world’s first fuel-efficient replacement
tire law (AB 844). This law directed the California Energy Commission to develop a State
Efficient Tire Program that includes the following issues: (1) develop a consumer education
program, (2) require that retailers provide labeling information to consumers at the point of sale,
and (3) promulgate through a rule development process a minimum standard for the fuel
efficiency of replacement tires sold. The California rule development process began January
2007.
Although the climate in California is significantly more moderate than Iowa, “all-season/allweather” LRR tires may be made available. Michelin tire manufacturers are currently
researching and developing “all-weather LRR tires.”

California State Fuel-Efficient Tire Report, California Energy Commission, January 2003.

Quantification Methods:
CCS evaluated and compared a series of existing assessments as follows:
At the request of the United States Congress, the National Research Council (NRC) of the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) conducted a study of the feasibility of reducing rolling
resistance in replacement tires. The 2006 NRC/NAS study made the following conclusions:
•

“Reducing the average rolling resistance of replacement tires by a magnitude of 10% is
technically and economically feasible.

•

Tires and their rolling resistance characteristics can have a meaningful effect on vehicle fuel
economy and consumption.”

H-50

A 2003 study commissioned by the California Energy Commission found that about 300 million
gallons of gasoline per year can be saved in that state with lower rolling resistance tires. A set of
four low rolling resistance tires would cost consumers an estimated $5 to $12 more than
conventional replacement tires. The fuel-efficient tires would reduce gasoline consumption by
1.5% to 4.5%, saving the typical driver up to $411 over the 50,000-mile life of the tires,
assuming a 4.0% fuel efficiency increase associated with the LRR tires and $3.50 a gallon
gasoline. Consumers in California would save more than $470 million annually at current retail
prices or approximately $1.4 billion over the 3-year lifetime of a typical set of replacement tires.
Key Assumptions:
The estimate of costs associated with LRR replacement tires assume lower tread and thus faster
tire wear and it includes production cost increases that are passed through to consumers.
According to the NRC/NAS study, consumers would pay an additional $12.00 per year to
replace tires (including installation), and they would pay an additional $1.00 per tire due to
increased production costs.
Key Uncertainties
The low-rolling-resistance fuel efficient tires program is based upon existing off-the-shelf
technologies and products that already exist in the consumer marketplace. These tires are already
available in the marketplace, and are comparable with the tires included as original equipment on
newly purchase light-duty vehicles.

TLU-7b. Fuel Efficient Operations for Light-Duty Vehicles:
Consumer Information on Vehicle Miles Per Gallon (MPG)

Policy Description
Provide consumers with information about the fuel efficiency and cost in relation to the
purchase, maintenance, and operation of their vehicles. Consumers would receive real-time
information on MPG while their vehicles are in operation and alerts when their tire pressure is
too low (i.e., devices such as Air Alert Valve Caps). Generally, a set of four light-emitting diode
(LED) self-calibrating tire pressure valve caps such as Tire Alert cost about $22.00, and real time
MPG monitoring systems such as ScanGauge are about $100.00. In addition, consumers would
receive public education and information relating to the impact that vehicle maintenance
practices have on the operation of their vehicles. Finally, consumers would be encouraged to
consider a vehicle’s MPG before and at the time of purchase.
Policy Design
This policy is designed to impact consumer choice and behavior.
Goals: Greatly increase the awareness and availability of consumer information on MPG to
result in greater fuel efficiency across the state.
Timing: Program would begin in 2010, with program expansion as resources are made available.
Parties Involved: Iowa Department of Transportation, product manufacturers, product
distributors, Iowa Automobile Dealers Association, Iowa Independent Automobile Dealers
Association, independent repair shops, Iowa Energy Center.
Implementation Mechanisms
The program would include consideration of the feasibility and cost of such a program.
Information and Education: Provide information and education to the general public and
commercial businesses on the relationship of efficient operation and proper maintenance of their
vehicles to the fuel efficiency of their vehicle. This information will be developed and made
available by the “parties involved” identified above.
Promotion and Marketing:
State Lead by Example: The state will lead by example by initiating an efficient vehicle
operation and maintenance program.
Encourage:
Local/county governments, businesses that depend upon vehicles to conduct daily business, and
federal agencies located within the state will all be encouraged to implement efficient operation
and maintenance programs.

H-52

Marketing Program: A marketing program will be developed by the state to encourage the
efficient operation and proper maintenance of vehicles.
Website: All state-supported programs would have dedicated detailed websites. In addition to
information and materials, program participation by the various governmental agencies and
individual businesses (i.e., success stories) would also be documented and extolled.
Funding Mechanisms and/or Incentives: This program would be promoted and incorporated
into the TLU-7a policy option for the replacement of tires on state fleet vehicles that is already
budgeted through the Iowa DOT annual funding processes. Additional funding mechanisms
should also be examined.
Enforcement: No enforcement actions are necessary as the program will be instituted as a
voluntary program.
Related Policies/Program in Place
None noted.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
The provision of consumer information on its own is not expected to produce measurable
reductions in GHG emissions. However, the provision of consumer information has the potential
to increase the effectiveness of other related programs. As a result, the GHG emissions
reductions that may be associated with these programs is incorporated into the estimates for other
TLU policies.

TLU-8. New Vehicle Standards for Increased Fuel Economy and Reduced
Greenhouse Gas Emissions

Policy Description
Iowa can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by improving the fuel economy of the light duty
vehicle (LDV) fleet. As also noted in TLU-6, a first step is to charge a state agency with tracking
the fuel economy of Iowa’s entire fleet. Once a baseline for Iowa’s fuel economy is established,
the state could then establish goals for improving the fuel economy of the entire fleet. For
example, if the current fuel economy is 20 miles per gallon (mpg), goals of 21 mpg by 2012 and
25 mpg by 2020 could be adopted. All other things equal, increasing fuel economy from 20 mpg
to 25 mpg would reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gases by 20%. Further reductions
beyond 2020 are also likely. Iowa could establish a goal of 40 to 200 mpg by 2050, reflecting the
Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council’s overall goals of reducing GHG emissions by 50 to
90% by 2050.
Iowa would adopt the State Clean Car Program in order to reduce GHG emissions from new
light-duty vehicles, with an expectation that the most significant greenhouse gas emissions
reductions beyond the new federal CAFÉ standards would come from the “Tier 2” state clean car
standards expected to be proposed in the near future.
Under the current federal law, states have the option of choosing between the federal standard for
air pollution emissions and the state standard. This policy assumed the standards, which must
still be approved by USEPA, would take effect in Iowa beginning with Model Year 2012
(calendar year 2011). Other Clean Car Program elements can include standards requiring
reductions in smog- and soot-forming pollutants, and promoting introduction of very lowemitting technologies into new vehicles.
New cars and light trucks in all states must comply with Federal emission standards, and,
generally speaking, states have the choice of adopting a stronger set of standards applicable in
California. In 2005, California finalized a set of GHG standards for new light duty vehicles,
phased in from 2009 to 2016. More than a dozen states already have adopted or stated an
intention to adopt the California Clean Car Program standards, including Arizona, Connecticut,
Maine, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont and Washington.
In December 2006, Japan revised its fuel economy targets upwards to improve the fleet average
fuel economy of new passenger vehicles from 13.6 km/L (33 mpg) to 16.8 km/L (40 mpg) in
2015, and increase of 24%. The International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates
that this standard is equivalent to an average of 125 g/km for CO2 emissions. In a 2007 review,
the European Union announced an EU objective of 120 g CO2/km (200 g or .44 lbs / mile) by
2012 to be met through an integrated approach, and is estimated to result in fleet emissions of
130 g/km (217 g or .48 lbs / mile) in 2012. China’s standards took effect as Phase I in July 2005,
increasing fuel efficiency from 26 mpg in 2002 to 28.4 mpg in 2006. Phase II is due to take
effect in January 2008 and January 2009. Starting in 2006, the South Korean standards for
H-54

mandatory fuel economy are 34.4 mpg for vehicles with engine displacements under 1,500 cubic
centimeters and 26.6 mpg for vehicles with over 1,500 cubic centimeter engines.
Policy Design
Goals: Improve fuel economy by 20% by 2012, 100% by 2020, and 250% or more by 2050.
Implementation to start in model year 2012 (calendar year 2011), with an 8 year phase in period.
Go beyond the current federal emissions standards for cars and light trucks within the parameters
of the next tier of the federal and state standards that can be considered within the planning
horizon Under the federal Clean Air Act, states can choose between the federal standard or go
with the more stringent state standards, provided that the necessary waiver has been granted by
the USEPA. For further consideration of state standards, the state of Iowa would undertake a
public involvement and consideration process before or during legislative or regulatory process
for transparency, and for consideration of the range of potential impacts.
Timing: To meet federal compliance, a rule writing process would take place by the appropriate
agencies so that Iowa can implement the California standards. Regulatory program could begin
with calendar year 2011, vehicle model year 2012 for new cars and light trucks.
Parties Involved: The law would directly affect automobile manufacturers, car dealers, and
consumers as well as the Iowa Department of Transportation, Iowa Department of Revenue,
County Treasurers, Iowa Automobile Dealers Association, and Iowa Independent Automobile
Dealers Association.
Other: The state clean car standards currently are being litigated. The timing may be affected by
the date of enactment of legislation, likely litigation, and the regulatory process.
Implementation Mechanisms
The first step is to charge a state agency with tracking the fuel economy of Iowa’s entire fleet.
Once a baseline for Iowa’s fuel economy is established, the state could then establish goals for
improving the fuel economy of the entire fleet. The State of Florida has recently begun using a
Florida-specific spreadsheet tool to assess future potential scenarios for improvements in vehicle
fleet fuel efficiency. The Florida VEGA (Vehicle Energy and Greenhouse Gas Assessment) Tool
is described at the following Web site: http://www.flclimatechange.us/ewebeditpro/items/
O12F18689.pdf. It is recommended that the state of Iowa conduct further analyses of scenarios
for increasing the fuel efficiency of its motor vehicle fleet to the goal levels described.
The second step would be to initiate a state rule-making process beginning with vehicle model
year 2012. As an alternative to a state rulemaking process, the state would support raising the
federal CAFE standards to provide for the equivalent level of GHG reductions.

Council on Clean Transportation, “Passenger Vehicle Greenhouse Gas and Fuel Economy
Standards: A Global Update,” July 2007

Quantification Methods:
The California Air Resources Board (CARB), the Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs), and
a coalition of New England States have all calculated the impact of the first tier of the state clean
car standards on GHG emissions. The Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) reviewed and
compared results of these analyses of clean car programs, and found all three modeling efforts to
be reasonable and valid. The PIRG model has been applied in Connecticut, Arizona, and New
Mexico. The model estimated a 13.7% reduction in GHG emissions from passenger vehicles by
2020 in Arizona and a 12% reduction in Connecticut. Both CARB and the New England states
estimated higher reductions, in the range of 18-19%. The primary sources of variation in these
modeling efforts are: (1) the mileage accumulation rates of VMT by passenger vehicle type, and
(2) the fleet turnover rate.
The analysis for estimation of GHG emissions reductions from vehicle standards assumes that
the effects of the Clean Car Program in Iowa will mainly be determined by the level of the “Tier
2” of the state clean car standards or the level of the next increase in the federal CAFE standards.
CARB has conducted analysis which estimates that the equivalent new light duty vehicle fuel
economy for the state’s clean car standards would be: 35.7 mpg in the year 2016 and 42.5 mpg in
the year 2020. In addition, CARB’s analysis estimates that the effect of the state clean car
standard being adopted in Iowa would be a potential reduction of 1.3 MMtCO2e in the year 2016

H-56

and a potential reduction of 2.9 MMtCO2e in the year 2020. The cumulative estimated GHG
reduction for the period 2009 through 2020 from adoption of the state clean car standards is 14.4
MMtCO2e for the State of Iowa. ( Sources: http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ccms/reports/
pavleycafe_reportfeb25_08.pdf and http://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/ccms/reports/final_pavley
addendum.pdf )
In order to estimate the effect of state clean car standards independent of the federal CAFÉ
standard, the potential federal CAFE-35 standards GHG reductions are subtracted from the state
“Clean Car 1 & 2” standards GHG reductions. For the year 2016, CARB estimates this value to
be 0.3 MMtCO2e and for the year 2020, CARB estimates this difference to be 0.8 MMtCO2e. On
a cumulative basis, the difference in the estimated values for the 2009-2020 time period is 4.1
MMtCO2e. (Sources: Ibid above)
CCS conducted a review of the CARB analysis, and found it to be the only publicly available
published analysis that has been peer reviewed. In addition, CCS has conducted an additional
analysis as part of the Inventory and Reference Case Projections analysis, which estimates the
federal CAFE 35 standard would result in 0.72 MMtCO2e GHG reductions in the year 2015, and
1.93 MMtCO2e reductions in the year 2020. Since the CARB analysis gives the federal standard
“more credit’ than the independently conducted CCS analysis, we use the CARB analysis in
order to provide the greater potential benefit from the federal program.
For cost-effectiveness, two independent analyses conducted by CARB and the Northeast States
for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) estimated that the potential benefit from
state standards are on the order of –$90/ ton and –$110/ton. CCS generally uses –$100 / ton as a
central estimate of cost effectiveness. In order to take into account the benefit from the federal
CAFE 35 standard, CCS assumes that the “low-hanging fruit” of the most cost-effective
technologies would be adopted by automakers first. As a result, the GHG reductions estimated to
result from CAFE 35 are expected to be in this –$90/ton to –$11/ton range. The further GHG
reductions associated with the balance of the state Clean Car standards (both 1 & 2) are
estimated to be in the range of –$50/ton to –$70/ton. In other words, they are still net beneficial,
but not as cost beneficial as the car improvements resulting from the CAFÉ 35 standard. We
apply the central estimate of –$60/ton to the balance of the GHG reductions resulting from the
state standard.
There is a third tier of car improvements and potential GHG emissions reductions resulting from
additional state policies beyond the state “Clean Car 1 & 2” standards. However, since there has
not been a thorough analysis of the effect of these policies to date, the analysis shown here does
not include the potential GHG emissions reductions, nor does it incorporate any cost savings
associated with this “third tier” of vehicle improvements. It is recommended that an analysis be
conducted for the midwestern states as a whole, in order to examine in greater detail the potential
GHG reduction effect and cost-effectiveness resulting from this third tier of vehicle
improvements. The Midwestern Governors Association (MGA) is conducting some work related
to the combined effects of state policies among midwestern states. As a result, the MGA would
be a potential organization to sponsor this analysis.

H-57

Key Assumptions:
The prior modeling efforts have established a valid and reasonable method of projecting GHG
emissions reductions from state clean car policies. The CCS comparison of the three modeling
methods provides some independent professional validation of the models and their results. The
key assumption of the emissions reduction projected by CCS is that the most likely scenario for
emissions reductions is one that would fall between the more conservative scenario projected by
the PIRG model and the more optimistic scenario projected by the California and the New
England models.
In addition, some recent analysis by the California Air Resources Board shows that while the
Tier 1 level of state clean car standards and the recently enacted new CAFÉ standards (from the
federal Energy Act of 2007) both result in new car standards at an estimated 35 MPG, the state
clean car standards are expected to reach that goal sooner in time, which would result in greater
GHG emissions reductions during the period of analysis. In addition, the CARB analysis shows
that a significant level of additional GHG emissions reductions is possible, through the Tier 2
iteration of the state Clean Car Standards planned for the near future.
Key Uncertainties
A key policy option to achieve improved fuel economy would be adopting California’s car
standards. This option is problematic because, at present, the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (US EPA) has not approved the waiver required for the adoption of California’s car
standards.
The net emissions impact of this policy depends on fleet turnover rates for light duty vehicles
and future patterns of consumer purchase choices between passenger cars and light duty trucks.
The timing of these policies also depends upon the decisions within the analysis period of both
the federal courts and the United States Congress.
Additional analysis of scenarios may be helpful in for the future. The current estimates do not
fully capture the full effect of the scenario described.
An Iowa Clean Car program in which the fuel economy of Iowa’s entire fleet is tracked would
likely rely on a greenhouse gas life cycle assessment (LCA) of the fuel choice as well as the
emission standards for cars and light trucks. California has embarked on such an assessment in
their Clean Car program, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is also charged with
doing an LCA for transportation fuels under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act
(EISA). It is possible that ethanol, the current biofuel of choice, would fare poorly in terms of
such an overall assessment. This is because greenhouse gases are emitted while growing corn
(e.g., nitrous oxide emissions from the denitrification of nitrogen-fertilizers) and from converting
land for additional corn supply. This could present a huge challenge to agriculture in Iowa and
the ethanol industry depending upon exactly how the life cycle assessment of the fuel is
performed. There are scientific uncertainties surrounding the standards that are being
promulgated by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) under the California Low Emission
Vehicle standards, and these standards could serve to limit the flex fuel market.

H-58

Additional Benefits and Costs
GHG emissions reductions from new vehicle standards are also expected to reduce the level of
demand for imported oil and oil products, including refined gasoline.
Feasibility Issues
The off-the-shelf technologies for increased fuel economy are currently being offered in the
marketplace by some manufacturers. Further advances in LDV fuel economy are expected to
become commercially available in the time period analyzed.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Unanimous.
Barriers to Consensus
Concern was expressed that a policy limited to new vehicles would not affect the fuel economy
of existing vehicles, potentially leading to a “jalopy effect” whereby owners retain their existing
and less efficient vehicles for longer periods of time. In addition, state-level adoption of car
standards that differ from those in other states in our region would create an uneven vehicle
market and would likely create barriers to dealer trades within the multi-state region.

H-59

TLU-9. Freight Strategies (Truck and Rail)

Policy Description
The movement of freight on Iowa’s transportation system plays a critical role in our economy.
Iowa also serves as a crossroad for the movement of freight across the country. In fact, it is
estimated that 43% of all freight movement in Iowa is just passing through the state. There has
been tremendous growth in freight traffic with truck traffic having grown more than 50% in the
last 15 years and expected to grow another 50% by 2020. National freight forecasts estimate an
89% increase in tons of freight by 2035.6 To meet this increased demand while minimizing
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) will require many actions. This policy option focuses on
infrastructure activities to support a greater increase in freight hauled on rail while considering
federal EPA emissions reduction changes that are currently being implemented with over-theroad diesel truck engines.
The use of rail to haul freight is more efficient from an energy consumption and GHG emission
perspective. According to EPA data, freight railroads account for just under 2% of U.S. GHG
emissions from transportation sources. The American Association of Railroads (AAR) estimates
that for every ton-mile of freight moved by rail instead of truck, two-thirds less GHG emissions
are emitted. AAR also estimates that if 10% of long-haul freight now moving by truck moved by
rail instead, annual GHG emissions would fall by more than 12 million tons.
The Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) and all other involved parties will assure the
most efficient movement of freight while reducing GHG emissions. This also has the effect of
delaying large investment needs to add capacity to the state highway system. With such large
growth in freight forecast it is unlikely that freight movements by truck could ever be reduced
but shifting more of the growth to rail would minimize the growth of GHG emissions. This effort
will require activities within Iowa, within the Midwest and nationally.
Policy Design
Goals: Reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions generated by freight movement through a
combination of the following actions:
Timing:
By 2010, the Iowa Department of Transportation and other interested parties, will:
•

Through regional, statewide and national planning activities, seek to remove bottlenecks
(both physical and operational) for the efficient movement of freight by all modes of
transportation.

Freight Challenge,” May 2007.
H-60

•

Establish a Statewide Freight Advisory Committee of public and private parties to identify
actions to support the efficient movement of freight and opportunities for intermodal freight
movement.

•

Support initiatives to encourage railroad capital investment to increase capacity (e.g. tax
credits).

•

Assist the identification of opportunities for increased intermodal freight movements (e.g. the
development of the ethanol terminal in Manly, IA where ethanol is brought in by truck from
multiple plants and shipped by rail).

•

Seek continued and increased legislative appropriations for the Rail Revolving Loan and
Grant Program. This funding supports rail improvements including the construction of rail
spurs to industry to encourage use of rail.

•

Continue to utilize federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding to
support rail freight improvements.

•

Seek opportunities to support truck stop electrification including use of federal Congestion
Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funding. This could also include incentives (e.g. tax
credits) to encourage installation of equipment.

•

Provide incentives to trucking firms and truck owners to equip their vehicle(s) with devices
that eliminate the need to idle including battery-electric auxiliary power systems, vehicle
battery systems, thermal energy storage systems, fueled auxiliary power systems, etc.

•

Provide incentives to trucking firms and truck owners including local and state municipalities
to invest in hybrid truck technology as it becomes available in class 7 and 8 trucks over the
next three years and beyond.

Parties Involved: Iowa Department of Transportation, local governments, Iowa Legislature,
regional/metropolitan planning organizations, Iowa Department of Economic Development,

Demand and Logistics Bottom Line Report”

Quantification Methods:
Estimate the reduction in CO2 emissions from reduced idling based on estimating the portion of
emissions and fuel consumption in the Iowa inventory that is attributable to Class 8 diesel trucks
traveling on long-haul trips, estimate the portion of the total fuel consumption that would be
consumed during idling, and apply a targeted reduction of 80% to this amount starting in 2008
and a reduction of 90% starting in 2015.
Estimate the mode shift potential from long-haul trucking to intermodal rail by estimating the
amount of heavy duty truck traffic on long-haul trips, the commodity mix share that is amenable
to an intermodal shift, the investment costs necessary to upgrade intermodal terminals and rail
bottlenecks, and the expected mode shift likely based on logistics cost cross-price elasticities.
Key Assumptions:
This analysis assumes idle reductions are achieved only by Class 8 diesel truck population; these
trucks idle for an average of 6 hours per day; they consume 0.8 to 1.2 gallons of diesel per hour
during idling; and that an 80% (by 2010) or 100% (by 2020) reduction of diesel idling from these
Class 8 trucks will be achieved. The cost analysis assumes a 5-year lifetime for idling technology
equipment, applied to 80% of Class 8 vehicles starting in 2008 and 90% of Class 8 vehicles
starting in 2015, at a cost of $6,000 per vehicle and a $4.80 per gallon diesel cost. Program
administration costs, enforcement costs, and fines have not been factored into the cost analysis.
Reduced vehicle maintenance costs have not been factored into the analysis. Track
improvements and intermodal terminal expansion will occur over 10 years beginning in 2009.

H-62

Key Uncertainties
The movement of goods related to the renewable fuels industry is a rapidly evolving area. The
rapid growth in ethanol production in Iowa in the last few years has had a significant impact on
Iowa’s highway and rail system. Preliminary analysis has attempted to quantify this impact and
further analysis is soon to be completed by Iowa State University (ISU). The analysis by ISU is
based on a comprehensive survey of farmers, ethanol/biodiesel producers and grain handlers.
Phase I of this analysis is expected to be complete very soon and will provide important
information on changes to the transportation of grain in Iowa due to ethanol/biodiesel
production.
Additional ethanol growth in Iowa will soon be based on production from cellulosic material
(switch grass, corn stover, etc.). Cellulosic material is significantly less dense than corn and
therefore will require greater volume of shipments of material. The impact of this increase in
volume is unknown but the Iowa Highway Research Board has approved funding for ISU’s
Center for Transportation Research and Education (CTRE) to evaluate this impact. By January
2010, CTRE will complete the study which will have the following objectives: (1) develop
traffic/fiscal assessment tools to understand the impact of biofuels on highways; (2) inventory
types of vehicles likely to be used in cellulosic industries and develop turning movement
templates and axle loading characteristics; (3) document the physical and fiscal impact on the
system over the next 15 to 20 years; and (4) develop public policy recommendations to address
impacts on the system. Of note is that this study will also evaluate impacts of larger vehicles
required for the rapidly growing wind power manufacturing and development activities in Iowa.

TLU-10. Fuel Strategies: Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (20% Reduction)

Policy Description
This option seeks to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the carbon intensity of vehicle fuels
sold in Iowa. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) would require all fuel providers in Iowa to
ensure the mix of fuel they sell into the Iowa market meets, on average, a declining standard for
GHG emissions measured in CO2 equivalent per unit of fuel energy. The State should regulate
quality standards for low carbon fuels. Low carbon fuels include, but are not limited to,
biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, hydrogen, compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas,
electricity, and low carbon blends such as E10 or E85. The standard would be measured on a
lifecycle basis in order to include all emissions from fuel production to consumption.
Fuel providers (defined as refiners, importers, and blenders of on-road vehicle fuels) will need to
demonstrate on an annual basis that their fuel mixtures provided to the market met the low
carbon standard. Options for compliance may include: blending or selling increasing amounts of
lower carbon fuels, using previously banked credits, and purchasing credits from fuel providers
who earned credits by exceeding the standard. Penalties for noncompliance will be determined
during the implementation process.
Increased use of renewable fuels typically results in lower GHG emissions when compared to the
petroleum-based alternatives. Iowa’s long standing 10% ethanol blended fuel has displaced
billions of gallons of gasoline over the course of its use in Iowa. Iowa currently leads the nation
in ethanol and biodiesel production and maintains incentives that support renewable fuels.
Currently, over 70% of all gasoline sold in Iowa is a 10% ethanol blend.
In December 2007, President Bush signed the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007
creating a Federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The Federal RFS mandates that by the year
2022, 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels will be used in the United States (current use is
estimated at 7.5 billion gallons). The standard is laid out to not only increase the production and
use of renewable fuels, but also to reduce GHG emissions. The standard specifies a 50%
reduction in GHG emissions from biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels; a 20% reduction
in GHG emissions from renewable fuels; and a 60% reduction in GHG emissions from cellulosic
biofuel as compared to the GHG emissions created by burning traditional fossil fuels. The recent
implementation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA’s) Renewable
Fuel Standard will help create additional demand for Iowa’s renewable fuels across the country.
State renewable fuel exports will continue to grow as other states begin formalizing their own
state standards for renewable fuels and GHG controls. The state of Iowa has also implemented an
incentive program that provides tax credits to retail dealers that increases with increasing volume
of biofuels sold.

The MGA has developed dual goals for biobased products and transportation within the Midwest
region:

H-64

1. Reduce the region’s dependence upon fossil fuel for transportation purposes, and
2. Increase utilization of regionally produced biofuels and other low-carbon advanced
transportation fuels for all transportation energy consumed in the region. Iowa should support
and exceed the progress made through the MGA.
Iowa Objectives
In addition to supporting implementation of the MGA platform for biofuels, Iowa should design
and implement programs to increase demand for biofuels and the infrastructure to support the
increased demand, and to foster development of biofuels with lower carbon footprints and
greater sustainability.
Policy Design
Goals: Create a Low Carbon Fuel Standard for transportation fuels (gasoline and diesel) sold in
Iowa that would reduce carbon intensity of Iowa’s on-road vehicle fuels by at least 20% by 2020.
In addition to the reduction standard and program timing, the following issues should be
addressed in creating the program:
•

Credit generation and trading

•

Life cycle model and boundary conditions

Timing: Following a design period, the program would be implemented prior to 2020. Fuel
providers would be required to meet the 20% reduction standard no later than 2020. If interim
targets for reduction in carbon intensity are established, they will reflect the likely importance of
cellulosic ethanol to meeting the standard and the likelihood that cellulosic ethanol will not be
available in large commercial quantities until 2015 or later.
Parties Involved: Fuel providers, Iowa Department of Economic Development, Iowa
Department of Environment and Natural Resources.
Compliance Pathways: The Low Carbon Fuel Standard does not specify any particular fuel or
vehicle technology. Table H-2, below, shows three possible compliance scenarios that would
meet the standard for gasoline in California. As envisioned in California, much of the reduction
in passenger vehicle fuel carbon intensity would be met by increasing ethanol use.

Implementation Mechanisms
A Governor’s Executive Order would initiate the process for development of the LCFS, followed
by a detailed report and rule-making proceedings that would involve consultation before
implementation. The appropriate state agencies will undertake a study to develop the framework
for the LCFS. Once the study is completed, it would be introduced to the State’s legislative
proceedings, at which point the appropriate state agency will conduct public hearings on the
proposal. Once adopted, an appropriate state agency will initiate a rule-making proceeding,
establishing and implementing the LCFS.
The LCFS is market-based and performance-based, allowing averaging, banking and trading to
achieve lowest cost and consumer-responsive solutions. A LCFS is also fuel neutral where fuel
H-66

providers will choose which fuels to sell and in what volumes. This provides flexible options for
compliance including: blending or selling increasing amounts of lower carbon fuels, using
previously banked credits and purchasing credits from fuel providers who earned credits by
exceeding the standard.
Fuel providers, defined as refiners, importers, and blenders of passenger vehicle fuels, would
demonstrate on an annual basis that their fuel mixtures provided to the market met the target by
using credits previously banked or purchased. Providers that exceed the performance target for
the compliance period will be able to generate credits in proportion to the degree of over
performance and quantity of fuel provided. These credits can be held for future use or sold to
other regulated fuel providers. Penalties for noncompliance will be determined during the
implementation process.
Related Policies/Program in Place
Renewable Fuels Standards (U.S. and Iowa)
Iowa’s state renewable fuel standard is the most progressive standard in the country. The
standard will be implemented beginning in the calendar year 2009 with incentives eligible in
2010. The Iowa standard, in cooperation with the Federal RFS, guides production and sets goals
for renewable fuel use over a span of 14 years.
Goals:
• 25% biofuel sales in Iowa by 2019
•

36 billion gallons produced in the U.S. by 2022

•

50% reduction in GHG emissions from biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels

•

20% reduction in GHG emissions from renewable fuels

•

60% reduction in GHG emissions from cellulosic biofuels

•

Goals defined in Iowa RFS and the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act

Timing: Achieve by 2022 under the Federal RFS and 2019 under Iowa RFS
Parties Involved: Federal Government, State Government, Producers, Marketers, Blenders,
Consumers, and Refiners.
Infrastructure
For the past three years, Iowa has been building its renewable fuel infrastructure for retail sites as
well as points of bulk distribution.
The Renewable Fuels Infrastructure Board (RFIB) oversees the funding of biodiesel bulk
facilities to create an extensive distribution network for biodiesel. The RFIB also funds retail
locations that require new equipment for E85 due to incompatibility issues with existing
equipment (moving from a hydrocarbon-based fuel to an alcohol-based fuel). This program is
administered by the Iowa Department of Economic Development.

Data Sources:
Life-cycle impacts of biofuels obtained from Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET model
(v1.7). Fuel consumption, fuel economy, and gasoline and ethanol prices obtained Energy
Information Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook, 2007 and 2008 releases. Price of
biodiesel and conventional diesel obtained from U.S. Department of Energy Alternative Fuels
Price Report, January 2008.
Quantification Methods:
The estimate of greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the low carbon fuel standard is based
upon a 20% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel sold in Iowa. A
ramp-up period is estimated so that the 20% goal would be reached at the horizon year, 2020.
The GHG “credit” attributed to this mitigation option is the incremental reduction on top of any
reduction due to current (baseline) use of biofuels. Ethanol currently makes up approximately
7% of Iowa gasoline sales (i.e., 70% of gasoline is an E10 blend); biodiesel sales are currently
small and assumed to be zero.
In order to estimate the likely ramp up in biofuels usage needed to meet the LCFS, a scenario
was developed, shown in Figure H-3, below. In this scenario, by 2020, ethanol in Iowa would
represent 40% of gasoline sales, with 70% of the ethanol used in flex-fuel vehicles (E85) and the
remainder used conventional vehicles operating on E10. All ethanol would come from corn
feedstocks through 2014. Starting in 2015, the market share of cellulosic ethanol would ramp up
so that by 2020, 40% of all ethanol would be from cellulosic feedstocks. Biodiesel (from soy)
would make up 50% of total Iowa diesel sales by 2020. The cumulative impact of this increase in
biofuels is a 20% reduction in average fuel carbon intensity in 2020.

Cost is calculated as the incremental cost of biofuels per gallon of gasoline equivalent (for
ethanol) or diesel equivalent (for biodiesel) multiplied by total consumption of each fuel.
Ethanol and gasoline prices in future years are drawn from the Energy Information
Administration’s Annual Energy Outlook, 2008. Based on information from the U.S. Department
Energy’s Alternative Fuels Price Report, January 2008, the difference in the average price of
biodiesel compared with conventional diesel in the Midwest is approximately $0.17 per gallon.
Note that the cost calculation does not include Federal subsidies in the form of tax credits for
ethanol or biodiesel. In addition, costs related to any vehicle upgrades, (e.g., flex-fuel vehicles
that can operate on ethanol blends up to E85) are not included
Key Assumptions:
• Program starts in 2010, first year of emission reduction.
•

Program reaches 20% carbon intensity reduction goal by 2020.

•

Program applies to all on-road vehicles, “replacing” current gasoline and diesel fuel.

•

Baseline accounts for:
7% ethanol existing market share, blended as E10 with ethanol feedstock for baseline
usage assumed to be 100% corn.
○ 0% existing biodiesel market share.

○

Key Uncertainties
Transportation fuel providers would need to undertake changes in their production and
distribution methods in order to achieve the goals. Because the policy does not prescribe
particular technology pathways, there is uncertainty surrounding which fuels and technologies
fuel providers will use to meet the standard. The program assumes that providers will use the
most cost-effective options to meet the standard, but compliance costs are unknown at this time.
H-71

Additional Benefits and Costs
Use of biodiesel reduces diesel particulate matter emissions, which have adverse public health
effects. Use of ethanol also reduces air pollution emissions.
A Low Carbon Fuel Standard for Iowa would likely rely on a greenhouse gas life-cycle
assessment (LCA) of the fuel. In the case of ethanol, this may include the indirect emissions
from growing corn as feedstock for the ethanol production industry and from conversion of land
(emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from land disturbance). California has embarked
on such an assessment for their Low Carbon Fuel Standards, and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency is also charged with doing an LCA for transportation fuels under the 2007
Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA). It is possible that ethanol (E10 and E85) would
fare poorly in terms of such an assessment (e.g., a 20% reduction in GHG emissions from
renewable fuels, or EU’s objective of 120 g CO2e/km). This is because greenhouse gases are
emitted while growing corn (e.g., nitrous oxide emissions from the denitrification of nitrogenfertilizers) and from converting land to corn. This could present a huge challenge to agriculture
in Iowa, producers, refiners, and blenders depending upon exactly how the life cycle assessment
of the fuel is performed and if ethanol-from-corn fails to qualify as a low carbon fuel. It is likely
that cellulosic ethanol, the next generation biofuel, will have a much better greenhouse gas
performance assessment and will certainly be classified as a low carbon fuel.
Feasibility Issues
There are feasibility issues associated with transporting large volumes of biofuels to and within
the state, as well as distributing biofuels to consumers. For example, ethanol cannot move in the
pipeline network used for transport gasoline and diesel fuel. These issues would need to be
resolved in order to achieve the LCFS.

Overlap Discussion
The amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduced or sequestered and the costs of a policy
option within the agriculture, forestry, and waste management (AFW) sectors overlap with some
of the quantified benefits and costs of policy options within other sectors. Where this overlap has
been determined to exist, the sector totals have been adjusted, and each instance is outlined
below. Overlaps between options within AFW have been accounted for within the goal-setting
process.
AFW-3 (Expanded Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for Electricity, Heat, or
Steam Production) outlines how biomass may be utilized for energy production. The Clean and
Renewable Energy (CRE) Subcommittee also quantified the use of biomass for energy
production (e.g., CRE-21 [Technology Initiatives, Including Renewables] and CRE-13 [Pricing
Strategies To Promote Renewable Energy and/or CHP]). AFW demands a greater amount of
biomass than does CRE. The biomass demand requirements for CRE (in million British thermal
units [MMBtu]) and associated costs were removed from the AFW sector totals because these
were considered to be accounted for under the CRE analyses.
AFW-5 (Urban Forestry) addresses planting trees in urban settings. The Energy Efficiency and
Conservation (EEC) Subcommittee does not specifically include tree planting to reduce energy
use in buildings as part of demand-side management and other energy efficiency programs.
Thus, no adjustments were made to the sector total.
AFW-6 (Cellulosic Biofuel) focuses on biofuels. Similar to utilization of biomass for production
of energy, utilization of biomass for production of cellulosic biofuels was greater under AFW
than in the transportation and land use (TLU) sectors. To adjust for the overlap between these
two Subcommittees, the AFW sector total emission reductions and costs were reduced by the
proportion determined to be included under the TLU-10 (Fuel Strategies [20% Low Carbon Fuel
Standard]) analysis.
AFW-7 (Energy Efficiency) addresses energy efficiency improvements through on-farm
applications. The EEC Subcommittee is responsible for quantifying energy efficiency
improvements across all sectors. It was assumed that the energy efficiency reductions in AFW-7
overlap with the reductions quantified by the EEC Subcommittee. Therefore, the energy
efficiency GHG reductions and cost savings from energy efficiency (in AFW-7) have been
removed from the sector total.
AFW-9 (Landfill Methane Energy Programs) focuses on landfill methane programs, which are
also addressed by CRE-2 and CRE-13). The GHG reductions and cost savings from AFW-9 have
been removed from the sector total.

CRE-2 (Technology Initiatives, Including Renewables) incorporates or adjusts for biomass used by CRE-5

Development).

AFW-1. Nutrient Management

Policy Description
Demonstrate and encourage the implementation of GHG-beneficial management practices,
including nutrient and soil management techniques to lower nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and
increase soil carbon (C) retention,2 limit or restrict nitrogen (N) fertilizer application on field
areas that are seasonally flooded, and increase the use of cover crops.3
Improve the efficiency of fertilizer use and other nitrogen-based soil amendment use through
implementation of improved management practices; development and use of crops and crop
hybrids and varieties capable of improved nutrient uptake efficiency; and full accounting of
nutrient applications through manure and other organic-based nutrient sources.
Support research critical for identifying GHG emissions associated with different nutrient
management practices, and research identifying those practices leading to reduced net GHG
emissions.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Efficiency—Increase the efficiency of fertilizer use (in terms of nitrogen applied/crop yield)
by 10% by 2020.
•

Seasonally flooded areas—Reduce nitrogen application by 50% on 50% of seasonally
flooded areas by 2020.

•

Improved nutrient distribution—Provide more of the state’s cropland nitrogen requirements
through improved distribution of natural and organic nitrogen sources (manures). Replace
10% of manufactured nitrogen sources through better manure distribution by 2020.

Timing: Most of these goals are currently being considered and implemented for economic
reasons, i.e., nutrient credit for manure. However, not all operators receive the economic benefit
of this investment. Reducing application to seasonally flooded areas will require additional
technology capable of site-specific applications based on land form in addition to that from soil
test maps.
2

The dilemma relative to nutrient management, N in particular, involves balances. For example, the Subcommittee
(SC) is confident that mandating N application reductions would reduce N2O emissions and GHG emissions
associated with N manufacture. However, reduced rates would most likely result in lower yields, lower plant
biomass production, and net loss of soil organic matter and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The science to
understand the direction of change exists, but not the scientific capability to quantify these input and output values
on a highly variable landscape in a changeable climate, and thus determine if given options would consistently result
in winners or losers.
3
Cover crops have been studied for decades with marginal advances, and at this time seem somewhat risky as a
required target mandate for this group. Research investment is needed to develop cropping systems in which cover
crops are complimentary to, rather than competitive with, the primary crop.

I-5

Parties Involved: Industry, scientists, and producers.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Possible methods of increasing the efficiency (yield/nitrogen input) include:
•

Incentives to encourage rapid adoption of new seed technologies that result in higher
nitrogen utilization,

•

Incentives for more soil testing,

•

Support for educational efforts on nitrogen utilization and fertilization practices, and

•

Incentives for more precision placement of nitrogen fertilizers.

Potential practices for reducing GHG emissions associated with manure handling and storage
include, but are not limited to, manure composting (to reduce methane emissions) and improved
methods for application of effluent to fields (for reduced N2O emissions). Application
improvements include incorporation into soil instead of surface spray/spreading.

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
N2O: Reduced on-field application of nitrogen will reduce formation of N2O. Reductions may
also occur when nitrogen runoff and leaching are reduced, which leads to the formation and
emission of N2O.
CO2: Reductions occur as soil carbon levels in crop soils are increased above business as usual
(BAU) levels. Increasing the levels of carbon in soils indirectly sequesters carbon from the
atmosphere.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2012, 2020 (MMtCO2e [million metric tons of carbon dioxide
equivalent]): 0.1 and 0.6, respectively.
Net Cost per tCO2e: $75.
Data Sources:
Efficiency—Annual N2O emissions from synthetic fertilizer and manure applications were taken
from the Iowa Inventory & Forecast (I&F).4 The average reduction in fertilizer usage resulting
from implementation of nutrient management practices (15%) was taken from a guidance

document from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).5 Cost information for
synthetic fertilizers was taken from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Economic
Research Service (ERS).6 The average cost of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers in the United States
in 2007 was $370/ton. Information on United States and Iowa corn crops was used to estimate
corn yields for 2005–2020.7
Seasonally flooded areas—Iowa State University (ISU) figures were used to determine the
amount of wetlands in the state of Iowa.8 Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) data were used
to determine the amount of wetlands currently under cultivation in the state.9
Quantification Methods:
Nitrogen Efficiency
The GHG benefits of this option are quantified by calculating the CO2e emissions/kilogram of
nitrogen (kgN) applied in Iowa. This uses a figure for the nitrogen emissions from fertilizer (4.76
kgCO2e/kgN applied), calculated from the Iowa I&F, which is then combined with a figure for
the life-cycle emissions of nitrogen fertilizer (West and Marland, 2002).10 A BAU projection is
created for fertilizer use (assumes no growth in fertilizer use between 2005 and 2020) and corn
production (from the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute database) through the year
2020. In order to increase efficiency (corn production and fertilizer use) by 10% under the policy
scenario, fertilizer use is reduced compared to the BAU estimate. Costs were calculated on the
basis of an estimate of the staffing, laboratory, and travel costs of creating an information
program that would encourage better nutrient management ($500,000/year + start-up costs) and
soil testing costs ($4.25/20-acre field, tested annually).11 There were also cost savings in terms of
reduced costs of nitrogen fertilizer. The assumed costs of fertilizer are based on the fuel prices,

Seasonally Flooded Areas
The amount of farmable wetlands in Iowa was estimated by dividing the acres of farmable
wetlands covered by the CRP by the number of acres of total wetlands under the CRP.13 This
percentage (51%) was then multiplied by the total amount of wetlands in Iowa, as estimated by
ISU. These farmable acres (218,821) were then assumed to have fertilizer use similar to that of
the state as a whole. These acres were divided by the total acres under cultivation in Iowa to
determine what percentage of Iowa farmland is located in wetlands (0.7%), and then multiplied
by the BAU estimates of fertilizer use created from the nitrogen efficiency quantification to
determine the BAU fertilizer used on wetlands. This fertilizer use is then projected to decrease
by 50% on half of the land in the state, or a 25% reduction overall by 2020. The GHG benefits of
this are estimated on the basis of the reduced nitrogen fertilizer use multiplied by the CO2e
emissions per kgN applied, as described in the Nitrogen Efficiency quantification above (AFW-1
Nitrogen Efficiency). The costs of this program were estimated to be $30–$50/acre, mostly in

Improved Nutrient Distribution
Since this item involves reducing the amount of nitrogen fertilizers applied while keeping actual
nitrogen application constant by using local manure applications, the GHG benefits take into
account only the life cycle costs of nitrogen fertilizer. The GHG emissions from the application
of nitrogen are assumed to remain constant under this policy. A BAU estimate of fertilizer use is
created for the state, as described in the Nutrient Efficiency quantification (see AFW-1 Nitrogen
Efficiency). BAU fertilizer use is then reduced by 10% by 2020. The amount of fertilizer saved
is then multiplied by the life-cycle emissions of nitrogen fertilizer to determine the GHG benefits
of this item. There are two types of manure costs factored into this analysis: (1) the physical cost
of the manure, estimated at $0.30/pound (lb) of nitrogen;15 and (2) transportation, which is
estimated at $0.001/gallon/mile (gal/mi).16 It is assumed that manure will be traveling an average
of 15 miles to be distributed.17 The manure in Iowa is assumed to be pig manure, since most of

more than 58,000 gal are required to provide one metric ton of nitrogen (tN). These
transportation and physical costs are added together to determine the gross cost of the nutrient
distribution program, and the avoided fertilizer costs are subtracted from this to determine the net
costs (Table I-1-3).

Key Assumptions:
Nitrogen Efficiency—It is assumed that it is possible to reduce fertilizer application without
having a negative impact on crop yield. In order to do this, improved timing and efficiency of
application are required.
It is assumed that no costs are associated with the increased labor that may result from enhanced
soil testing in this option. This could vary, depending on the value of a particular farmer’s time
and the length of time it takes to conduct annual soil tests.
Key Uncertainties
Nutrient Distribution—The costs of nutrient distribution may change, depending on the distance
the manure needs to be transported. If this program is successful in encouraging localized
nutrient distribution, then costs will likely be lower.

I-10

Changes in acreage and nutrients for the use of biomass or biofuels will most likely affect the
level of nutrient application required. For example, if corn stover is removed for cellulosic
ethanol (as is planned in AFW-6), then that plant material will not be providing nutrients when it
decomposes back into the soil. This in turn may require increased fertilizer application to
maintain the productivity of the soil.
In AFW-2, drainage of seasonally flooded areas is a goal. If this develops, reduced nitrogen
application on 50% of seasonally flooded soils may not be necessary because these areas will
more likely be productive a greater portion of the time. Thus, fully implementing this option in
AFW-1 might be appropriate early in the program, but as the drainage option is implemented for
AFW-2, it may be beneficial to scale back the nutrient reduction recommendations for seasonally
flooded areas.
The fertilizer costs are based on an analysis provided by AFW Subcommittee member Dave
Miller that predicts fertilizer prices by using natural gas prices, which come from the Annual
Energy Outlook 2008 (AEO 2008) (Early Release).20 Fuel prices are difficult to predict, and if
the prices used in AEO 2008 are not correct, then the estimates for fertilizer costs are also likely
to be inaccurate.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Seasonally Flooded Areas—This serves to reduce the amount of nitrogen being applied to
wetlands in the state. These areas may be of particular importance to biodiversity and
environmental quality, but these benefits will be very difficult to measure.
Feasibility Issues
There may be barriers to start-up for a market for local manure products. Improved nutrient
distribution will rely upon such a market to ensure that farmers will be able to sell their manure.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Majority (7 objections).
Barriers to Consensus
There were some concerns about the amount of GHG benefits and the cost per ton of GHGs
reduced.

AFW-2. Wetlands and Drainage

Policy Description
Over the next 50 years, the drainage infrastructure of 6 million acres within the Des Moines
Lobe21 of Iowa will undergo redesign and replacement because the existing common outlet
drains are approaching the end of their life. These drainage systems can be redesigned with or
without GHG considerations and water quality benefits. Designing to reduce nitrogen transport
to water resources also reduces N2O emissions in Iowa and downstream, with significant global
GHG benefits over the longer term. This is due to the function of strategically targeted and
designed denitrification wetland systems and the long life of both the wetlands and the drainage
systems (≈125 years).
This policy option will implement the Iowa Integrated Drainage and Wetland Landscape
Systems initiative for reducing N2O emissions and nutrient transport to water resources from
cropland subsurface drainage, to (1) protect in-state emissions and (2) reduce nutrients—nitrogen
and phosphorus—transported to water resources.
Strategically located and designed denitrification wetlands reduce N2O emissions by providing
more complete denitrification to elemental nitrogen than if the nitrate were transported to
downstream surface and groundwater systems where denitrification would at least partly occur.
The denitrification wetlands provide the co-benefits of reducing nitrogen delivery to receiving
water resources by 40%–90% from large contributing watersheds (500–4,000 acres) by
denitrifying incoming nitrate (NO3–).
Redesign and replacement to increase the flow capacity of common outlet subsurface tile drains
reduce N2O emissions by reducing denitrification and N2O emissions from wet and seasonally
flooded croplands. Increased capacity drains provide the co-benefits of reducing phosphorus
delivery to water resources by decreasing surface runoff and quick flow to streams. This reduces
erosion, sediment transport, and phosphorus transport to streams.
Research: Additional research is needed to further quantify the GHG implications from N2O,
CO2, and methane (CH4) of:
•

Subsurface drainage in agricultural croplands,

•

Strategically located and designed nitrogen removal wetlands, and

•

Denitrification in receiving streams and rivers.

Policy Design
Goals:
• During 2009–2012, implement approximately 5 pilot demonstration sites per year, for a total
of 25 initial pilot demonstrations. Each pilot demonstration will be implemented in an Iowa
drainage district having an average watershed drainage area of 2,400 acres.
21

A watershed located in north-central Iowa drained mostly by the Des Moines, Raccoon, Iowa, and Skunk Rivers.

I-12

•

During 2012–2020, following confirmation of benefits from monitoring and assessments of
the initial 25 pilot demonstrations, complete 200 additional pilot demonstrations
implemented in Iowa drainage districts.

•

By 2050, achieve full implementation of the Iowa Integrated Drainage and Wetland
Landscape Systems initiative across the 6 million acres of Iowa’s 3,000 drainage districts.

Timing: Initial pilot demonstrations (up to 225 individual sites and drainage districts) will be
deployed through 2020. Following confirmation of suitable benefits, full implementation is
targeted across 3,000 drainage districts and 6 million acres of cropland during the 2020–2050
period. This policy option will achieve limited N2O reductions 2009–2020, because activities
conducted during that period will primarily be pilot demonstrations and assessments of pilot sites
to confirm GHG, water quality, wildlife habitat, and other benefits. Adoption across the 6 million
acres of land within Iowa’s 3,000 existing drainage districts will occur during the 2020–2050
period, with significant N2O reductions occurring during that period as well as during the
remainder of the estimated 125-year life of the replacement systems. Widespread deployment of
these integrated landscape systems by 2050 through voluntary initiatives is relatively ensured if
this initiative goes forward, because the existing common outlet drains are nearing the end of
design life and are subject to structural failure, necessitating replacement to avoid the economic
loss of taking high-value land out of row-crop production.
Parties Involved: Public conservation agencies, research institutions, existing Iowa drainage
districts, and private landowners.
Other: Combining nitrate-removal wetlands with drainage improvements through this voluntary
Iowa initiative will reduce GHG emissions and reduce nitrate and phosphorus transport to water
resources, thus protecting local drinking water supplies and reducing hypoxia in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Implementation Mechanisms
Existing authorities of Iowa Drainage Districts codified in Iowa statutes. Existing USDA
authorities and authorities of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship
(IDALS) to conduct the Iowa Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP), which will
be the public funding partner to assist with implementation.
Existing federal laws and regulations are problematic for implementing integrated drainage and
wetland landscape systems, because they have not encouraged the optimization of landscape
function but are instead maintaining historically farmed wetlands, which are continuously
cropped and highly degraded. While the environmental benefits and market economics are strong
to optimize landscape function through redesign and replacement of the common outlet drains,
implementation of this initiative is not ensured under current federal wetland regulations. Future
federal wetland regulatory policy needs to focus on landscape optimization to improve wetland
function and water quality, reduce GHG emissions, and enhance crop production.
The initiative capitalizes on the aging infrastructure of Iowa’s drainage districts, now 80–90
years old, and the need to replace the drains. Environmental stewardship may help encourage the
replacement of drains to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in water resources, thus facilitating

I-13

associated N2O GHG reductions. The initiative also capitalizes on the enhanced economic
returns of grain production to provide the private market-sector driver to implementation, largely
the result of biofuels consumption of feed grains.
Following successful pilot demonstrations, the initiative will be implemented primarily through
private (landowner) funds. Some public funding will be required for the initiative, for incentives
for the initial pilot demonstrations, and for necessary assessments of the pilot sites.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
None identified.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
N2O: Reduced N2O emissions through reduced denitrification in strategically located and
designed denitrification wetlands and through improved subsurface drainage to reduce N2O
emissions in seasonally wet and flooded croplands.
CO2: Conservation of wetlands helps maintain the ability of the land to sequester carbon in soil
and biomass.
CH4: Improved drainage reduces anaerobic decomposition, thereby preventing methane (CH4)
creation.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2012, 2020 (MMtCO2e): 0.007 and 0.16, respectively. Note that
GHG reductions from full implementation across 6 million acres by 2050 are estimated at 1.8
MMtCO2e/year and will continue over the estimated 125-year design life of the wetland and
drainage systems.
Net Cost per tCO2e: $218.
Preliminary quantification indicates approximately 31 MMtCO2e and –$2.4 billion costs (i.e., net
cost benefit) over the 2009–2050 period. This results in a cost-effectiveness over the 2009–2050
period of approximately –$78/tCO2e (i.e., net cost savings).

Quantification Methods:
The quantification methods described below indicate modest benefits in the short term. The
nature of this policy results in the delivery of significant benefits (e.g., GHG, water quality, and
crop production) in the longer term (i.e., post-2050). Quantification estimates indicate that this
option could result in 1.8 MMtCO2e GHG reductions by 2050. Additionally, the implementation
of this policy has the potential to improve agricultural net income revenues by 7%–20% through
improved drainage. The long payback period is due to the long life of the wetland and drainage
systems (≈125 years).
Strategically Located and Designed Denitrification Wetlands
N2O emission rates reported for wetlands receiving agricultural NO3– loads are approximately
equivalent to rates reported for cultivated crops. This means that restoring wetlands on formerly
cultivated cropland would have no significant net effect on N2O emissions from the area restored
to wetland.22, 23 This also means that N2O emissions from restored wetlands can be disregarded
in calculating the net change in N2O emissions for wetlands restored on former cropland.
From Mosier et al. (1998),24 N2O emissions from waters receiving nitrogen in agricultural
leaching/runoff can be estimated as:
N2O emissions = (kgN in leaching and runoff) × emission factor (EF)
Where EF = (0.025 kgN2O-N)/(kgN in leaching and runoff)
and N2O-N = the nitrogen component of N2O
In a parallel fashion, the net downstream reduction in N2O emissions due to nitrate removal in
wetlands can be calculated as:
Reduction in N2O emissions = (kgN removed in wetland) × EF
This product could be expected from the total mass of nitrate-nitrogen removed by the wetland
and the emission factor (EF) for N2O emission if the nitrate were removed by the wetland instead
of being transported to surface water and groundwater systems downstream.
Table I-2-1 shows the mass reduction in N2O emissions that could be expected for nitrate
removal wetlands intercepting agricultural leaching/runoff from source areas of 6 million acres
(with wetlands occupying 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% of the total area; the size of the wetland is

Wetlands occupying 0.5%–2% of the 1.5–6-million-acre source areas could be expected to
reduce N2O emissions from waters receiving nitrogen in agricultural leaching/runoff from those
source areas by approximately 32%–78% compared to emissions if the wetlands did not exist.
Increased Capacity of Common Outlet Subsurface Drainage
Hofstra and Bouwman (2005)25 estimated N2O emissions from agricultural soils and the impacts
of drainage. They reviewed 336 experiments from around the world that measured N2O
emissions from various combinations of soils, crops, and fertilizers. They developed a metamodel from those results that can be used to predict annual N2O emissions based on four
factors—drainage, nitrogen fertility rate, crop type, and method of measurement.
Based on soil survey information, it was estimated that about 68% of the soils in the Des Moines
Lobe are somewhat poorly drained or wetter soils that need tile drainage. The remaining 32%
were estimated to be soils that do not need tile drainage. For the integrated drainage wetland
systems, it was estimated that the poorly drained and wetter soils would be artificially drained,
such that they would have emissions rates similar to the soils that are assumed to not need tile
drainage. The open-chamber method26 with upland soils and a nitrogen application rate of 150–

225 lb/acre was used to estimate denitrification or N2O emissions (Hofstra and Bouwman, 2005).
The overall N2O emissions, with 68% of the soils considered to have poor drainage and 32% of
the soils considered to have good drainage, were compared to a condition where 100% of the
soils was considered to have good drainage. The N2O emissions were estimated to be 3.86
kg/hectare (ha)/year from the soils with good drainage and 6.22 kg/ha/year for the soils with poor
drainage.
The combined effect of wetland denitrification and increased capacity for subsurface drainage is
about 0.16 MMtCO2e in 2020. The GHG benefits greatly improve after the demonstration phase,
and are projected to increase to approximately 1.79 MMtCO2e annually beginning in 2050.
On the cost side, there are two main cost components:
1. Implementation costs associated with the additional cost required for land acquisition,
engineering, construction, seeding, and engineering for and construction of new drains; and
2. Cost savings gained through increased income from improved crop production resulting from
the enhanced drainage.
The implementation costs are broken down in Table I-2-2.

As a result of improving the wetlands within Iowa, there is the potential to increase crop yield by
7%–20% watershed-wide, which in turn provides potential cost savings for the implementation
of this option. This analysis assumes an average crop yield improvement of 10% (compared to
BAU) on 77% of the watershed (i.e., 7.7% total improvement). The analysis further assumes that
55% of watershed acres are in corn production, while 45% are in soybean production. It is
assumed that current crop production is approximately 190 bushels/acre for corn (current price is
approximately $5.00/bushel) and 55 bushels/acre for soybeans (current price is approximately
$10.00/bushel). While commodity prices are uncertain and volatile, they are used to provide
estimates of the potential benefits that result from improved drainage. These assumptions
indicate an average income increase of $59.29/watershed acre/year over the 125-year design life
of wetlands and drains.
The results shown in Table I-2-3 indicate the net costs over the period 2009–2020. However,
significant benefits (both GHG and cost) are realized post-2020. Preliminary quantification

It is assumed that drain engineering costs would not result in additional costs for this policy, as much of the these
costs would be incurred through business as usual drainage management.

Key Assumptions:
This analysis assumes (1) a crop yield improvement of 7.7%, and (2) 55% of the watershed
produces corn, while 45% produces soybeans.
Key Uncertainties
The impacts on carbon formation (CO2 and CH4) were considered in the analysis, but not in
sufficient detail to be certain of the overall impacts. However, it was determined that the changes
in CO2 and CH4 emissions are likely to be less than the changes seen in N2O. Given that the
global warming potential (as a CO2 equivalent) for N2O is more than 10 times that of CH4 and
more than 300 times that of CO2, the emission changes from these gases are not likely to be
significant. Formation of CH4 occurs at greater rates in warmer areas, whereas colder weather is
more conducive to the formation of N2O in wetlands.
Research is necessary to reduce the uncertainties in carbon and methane fluxes in wetlands and
to provide better information on appropriate management techniques and the potential for GHG
emissions savings through effective management, restoration, and conservation of wetlands.
Additional Benefits and Costs
In addition to the public-sector costs to help with implementation, enhanced crop yields are
expected to increase net income to landowners as a secondary result of improving capacity of
subsurface drainage to reduce surface runoff, quick flow, and sediment-borne phosphorus to
water resources. Crop yield improvements have been predicted by previous studies to be between
I-18

7% and 20% annually, estimated at 8% for this analysis. Minor public-sector funding will be
needed to help with implementation, and public funding will be needed especially to seed the
initial pilot demonstrations. However, upon full implementation, the total net returns beyond
expenditures are expected to be positive.
Improved wetland function and value will likely have additional benefits from improved
ecosystem services. Ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, air purification, water
filtration and cooling, nutrient storage and cycling, storm and flood damage protection, and
hydrologic regime maintenance are all provided in high-value wetlands and other natural lands.28
They also serve as vital habitat for wild species, maintain a vast genetic library, provide scenery,
and contribute in many ways to human health and quality of life.
Quantification estimates indicate that this option could deliver 1.8 MMtCO2e in GHG reductions
by 2050.
Feasibility Issues
None identified.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Super Majority (5 objections).
Barriers to Consensus
There were some concerns over the short-term GHG benefits and the cost per ton of GHGs
reduced.

AFW-3. Expanded Use of Agriculture and Forestry Biomass Feedstocks for
Electricity, Heat, or Steam Production

Policy Description
Increase the amount of biomass (including biomass from forest sources) available for cogeneration of electricity or for use in combined heat and power (CHP) applications to displace
the use of fossil energy sources, recognizing that local electricity or heat production yields the
greatest net energy and carbon displacement payoff. Increase the acreage and the yield of energy
crop production and utilization through the planting of energy-purpose crops.
Note that this option is focused on the supply-side aspects of promoting biomass fuel, with an
emphasis on the development of feedstocks, collection, processing, and transport technologies.
The demand-side aspects of renewable fuels (including biomass use) are being addressed through
the CRE options (CRE-13: Pricing Strategies To Promote Renewable Energy, and CRE-2:
Technology Initiatives).
Policy Design
Goals:
• Energy crop—Annually harvest at least 5 million dry tons of dedicated materials for energy
crop production by 2020, which includes establishing 1 million acres of identified energy
crop production by 2020, transitioning 50% of expiring CRP contracts to energy crop
production.
•

Agriculture crop residue—Annually harvest at least 10 million tons of crop residue biomass
for energy production by 2020.

•

Forest biomass—Annually harvest at least 75% of available forest products or wood residues
for biomass energy production by 2020.

•

Biomass energy plant—Have at least one major industrial operation contracting with
producers to use biomass as the primary energy source for plant operations by 2015
[unquantified].

•

Biofuels energy plant—Have at least one biofuels production plant contracting with
producers to use biomass as the primary energy source by 2015 [unquantified].

Timing: As stated above.
Parties Involved: Farmers, landowners, and energy producers.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Incentive Programs
• Section 476C tax incentives.

State and federal cost-share programs for energy crop establishment.

•

USDA value-added agriculture development grants.

•

Federal Renewable Fuel Standard.

•

•

•

State fuel standards and incentives.

Incentives and/or mechanisms are required to promote the collection and distribution of biomass
feedstocks and to encourage the location of energy facilities close to the source of the biomass
feedstock.
Biomass Delivery Supply Chain
There is a need to streamline the biomass delivery supply chain from biomass producer through
to energy facility. Iowa currently does not have a well-established delivery supply chain for
forest biomass as an energy feedstock. A study needs to be undertaken to analyze how to
selectively harvest and deliver biomass products in a manner that is beneficial to local
ecosystems, is economically feasible, and reflects responsible land use. That study needs to
involve a wide range of stakeholders, including foresters, conservationists, environmental
organizations, industry, and local governments. A system for evaluating and determining where
and how to begin harvesting forest biomass as an energy feedstock also needs be developed and
implemented.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Section 476C of the Iowa Code provides for a renewable energy tax credit for biomass and other
qualifying renewable energy sources used to generate electricity or heat for a commercial purpose.
A producer or purchaser of renewable energy may receive renewable energy tax credits under
Section 476C in an amount equal to $0.015 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity, or
$4.50/MMBtu of heat for commercial purposes, or $4.50/MMBtu of methane gas or other biogas
used to generate electricity, or $1.44/1,000 cubic feet of hydrogen fuel generated by and
purchased from an eligible renewable energy facility.
Alternative Energy Law (Iowa’s Renewable Portfolio Standard): Iowa requires its two
investor-owned utilities—MidAmerican Energy and Alliant Energy Interstate Power and Light
(IP&L)—to contract for a combined total of 105 megawatts (MW) of their generation from
renewable energy resources.
Fuel Mix Disclosure: Iowa’s rate-regulated electric utilities must report annually to customers the
percentage mix of fuel and energy used to produce electricity. The percentages for renewables
must be further broken down into percentages of electricity generated by wind, solar, hydropower,
biomass, and other resources. Each utility’s annual report must also include an estimate of sulfur
dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and CO2 emissions for each fuel and resource.

Quantification Methods:
GHG Benefit
This analysis focuses on the incremental GHG benefits associated with the utilization of
additional biomass to offset the consumption of fossil fuels. The analysis assumes that biomass
will be used to replace coal in the RCI sectors and the electricity sector (where coal represents
about 82% of electricity generated in Iowa).29
The GHG benefits were calculated by the difference in emissions associated with each of the
input fuels (0.0959 tCO2e/MMBtu for sub-bituminous coal, 0.0539 tCO2e/MMBtu for natural
gas, and 0.0019 tCO2e/MMBtu for biomass, including non-methane and non-N2O emissions).30

on the difference in costs between supply of biomass fuel and the assumed fossil fuel that it is
replacing (i.e., coal). The assumed costs of biomass are identified in Table F-3-4. Delivered coal
fuel cost ($/MMBtu) were taken from AEO 2008 (http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/prices.html).
The cost of implementing this policy option is estimated by assuming the replacement of coal
with biomass. The difference in cost of feedstock supply between biomass and coal is calculated
using the costs outlined in Table I-3-4. The difference in costs (dollars per million British
thermal units [$/MMBtu]) is multiplied by the amount of coal energy (MMBtu) being replaced
by biomass. The assumed incremental capital costs are based on the capital costs associated with
establishing a biomass plant compared with establishing a coal plant. Capital, operational, and
maintenance costs were taken from Table 38 of AEO 2007. While use of biomass may be
pursued through other technology types (e.g., gasification) or end uses (e.g., heat or steam), this
methodology was used to provide an estimate of possible capital costs required to enable the
utilization of biomass. (Table I-3-5)

Key Assumptions:
The capital infrastructure life span is assumed to be 30 years, and the interest rate is assumed to
be 5%, giving a capital recovery factor of 0.065 (i.e., a $1 million plant is assumed to cost
approximately $65,000 per year over the life of the project).
The fuel mix being replaced by biomass is assumed to be 100% coal. Biomass is assumed to
have a reduction of 0.0940 tCO2e/MMBtu when replacing coal combustion.
While energy production from biomass may be pursued through a range of technology types
(e.g., co-firing, gasification, or direct firing) or end uses (e.g., electricity, heat, or steam), the
capital costs from AEO 2008 were used to provide an estimate of possible capital costs required
to enable the utilization of biomass. The capital costs associated with using biomass as an
alternative to fossil-based generation are dependent on many factors, including the end use (i.e.,
electricity, heat, or steam), the design and size of the systems, the technology employed, and the
configuration specifications of the system. Each system implemented under this policy would
require a detailed analysis (incorporating specific engineering design and cost aspects) to provide
a more accurate cost estimate for the system.
Revenue from the production tax credit31 was not included in this analysis. While this tax credit
may be available to systems put into place prior to January 1, 2012, it is not included in this
analysis to reflect the true cost of implementation.
Key Uncertainties
Availability, collection, and distribution will be key issues that will affect the implementation of
this option, particularly on the cost side. Collection and distribution are particularly important for
the utilization of agriculture and forest residues.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Biochar—Biochar is a by-product of certain thermochemical energy production processes. The
application of biochar to crop fields is believed increase both soil productivity and soil carbon
levels. The land application of biochar should be conducted, even though the level of GHG
benefits is not fully understood and additional research is required.
Any biomass produced, sold, and used under this option allows for funds to remain within Iowa,
unlike other energy feedstocks (e.g., coal and natural gas), which require that payments be made
to the state from which that feedstock is sourced.
If implemented correctly, the production of energy crops can provide watershed benefits.

31

Section 476C of the Iowa code provides for a renewable energy tax credit, which includes biomass. The
production tax credit is equal to $4.50/MMBtu of methane gas. This tax credit is available to biogas recovery
facilities (anaerobic digester systems), that were placed into service on or after July 1, 2005, and before January 1,
2012.

I-27

Feasibility Issues
The sustainability of utilizing forest residue from harvesting operations could reduce the
feasibility of this option. The forest residue data for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
(NREL) report were derived from the USDA Forest Service’s (USFS’s) Timber Product Output
database for 2002. Under forest residue, NREL included logging residues and other removals,
defined as “the unused portions of trees cut, or killed by logging, and left in the woods.” Other
removals would be trees cut or otherwise killed by cultural operations (e.g., pre-commercial
thinning, weeding) or land clearings and forest uses that are not directly associated with highquality wood product harvests. It is likely that 75% utilization is achievable from a sustainability
perspective, but may be less feasible from an economic perspective.
Status of Group Approval

Level of Group Support

AFW-4. Encourage Large-Scale Manure/Methane
Management Capture Utilization

Policy Description
This policy option reduces methane emissions from livestock manure by installing (1) large-scale
anaerobic digester systems at locations that can service multiple concentrated animal feeding
operations (CAFOs) and (2) anaerobic digester systems at larger individual CAFOs.
Methane captured from the digesters is used to create heat or power, which offsets fossil fuelbased energy production and the associated GHG emissions. This option is focused on
implementing these projects on a large scale (e.g., community-based systems or large CAFOs).
Policy Design
Goals:
• Utilization—By 2020, utilize 50% of available methane from livestock manure (primarily
dairy, swine, and poultry) for renewable electricity, heat, and steam generation or
incorporation into natural gas distribution systems.
•

Management—By 2020, apply improved manure handling and storage practices on 50% of
manure generated.

Timing: As stated above.
Parties Involved: Landowners, farmers, energy producers, and energy users.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Reduce GHG emissions associated with manure handling and storage. Potential practices include
manure composting (to reduce methane emissions) and improved methods for application of
effluent to fields (for reduced N2O emissions). Application improvements include incorporation
into soil instead of surface spray/spreading.
Other implementation mechanisms include tax incentives, grants, and loan guarantees.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Section 476C of the Iowa Code provides for a renewable energy tax credit for biomass and
other qualifying renewable energy sources used to generate electricity or heat for commercial
purposes.
A producer or purchaser of renewable energy may receive renewable energy tax credits under
Section 476C in an amount equal to $0.015/kWh of electricity, or $4.50/MMBtu of heat for
commercial purposes, or $4.50/MMBtu of methane gas or other biogas used to generate

IA DNR Anaerobic Digestion Outreach Program: Recognizing the enormous opportunity for
the wide-scale implementation of farm-scale and community-based anaerobic digester systems in
Iowa, the IA DNR Energy and Waste Management Bureau set about promoting the digester
concept to Iowa communities having substantial concentrations of livestock production,
considerable volumes of organic wastes, and numerous energy users.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
•

CO2, N2O, CH4: Displaces emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

•

CH4: Capture and utilization of or preventing the creation of methane.

•

N2O: Reductions occur when nitrogen runoff and leaching are reduced, which leads to the
formation and emission of N2O.

Quantification Methods:
Utilization GHG Benefits
Methane emissions (in MMtCO2e) data from the I&F were used as the starting point to estimate
the GHG benefits of utilizing the volumes of methane targeted by the policy and to add in the
additional benefit of electricity generation using this captured methane (through offsetting fossilbased generation). The first portion of GHG benefit is obtained from reduced methane emissions

I-30

by capturing emissions from manure and poultry litter.32 An assumed collection efficiency of
75%33 is applied to methane emissions from manure and poultry litter, which is then multiplied
by the assumed policy target ramping up to achieve 50% utilization by 2020.
The second portion of the GHG benefit is from offsetting fossil fuels—either natural gas
displacement or the displacement of fossil-based electricity generation. It was assumed that 50%
of the methane available would be utilized to offset natural gas, and 50% would offset electricity.
To estimate the electricity produced, the methane captured in each year was converted to its heat
content (Btu) and then multiplied by a natural gas heat rate of 11,664 Btu/kWh.34 The CO2e
associated with this amount of electricity in each year is estimated by converting the kWh to
megawatt-hours (MWh) and then multiplying this value by the electricity emission factor taken
from the EEC Subcommittee (Table I-4-2).

The total GHG benefit is estimated as the sum of both portions of the benefit described above
and is summarized in Table I-4-3.

32

While this analysis assumes that methane is captured and utilized from poultry litter, it is probably more likely
that energy is obtained through the direct firing of poultry litter (rather than through methane collection).
33

The collection efficiency is an assumed value based on engineering judgment. No applicable studies were
identified that provided information on methane collection efficiencies achieved using manure digesters (as it relates
to collection of entire farm-level emissions).

Utilization Costs
The costs for the dairy and swine components are estimated using a USDA Natural Resources
Conservation Service (NRCS) analysis.35 The production costs are assumed to be $0.11/kWh and
$3.17/MMBtu for swine anaerobic digesters and $0.05/kWh and $4.00/MMBtu for dairy
anaerobic digesters.36 These costs were converted to 2005 dollars (from 2006 dollars) and
assume a 30% thermal efficiency. They include annualized capital costs for the digester,
generator, and operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.37 A study in South Carolina by Flora.
and Riahi-Nezhad provided the assumed costs for the poultry component ($0.103/kWh in 2005
dollars using anaerobic digestion).38 The value of electricity produced is taken from the projected

Management GHG Benefits
The GHG benefits of this policy were estimated for Iowa pig farms, which yield approximately
84% of total manure management emissions. The emissions from pig farms were taken from the
Iowa I&F. According to a recent waste management study, improved aerobic waste treatment
systems in swine farms previously using anaerobic lagoons for manure management were able to
reduce GHG emissions by 97%.40 Treatment methods included specialized flocculation
(clumping) and aeration with nitrifying bacteria pellets to convert the volatile solids into stable
carbon compounds. Waste management systems in Iowa are assumed to be 25% anaerobic

lagoons, and the rest are deep-pit storage. While it is likely that the advanced methods described
in the Vanotti et al. study could be applied to other manure management systems, such as deeppit systems, they were not considered in the analysis. It was assumed that the costs and GHG
benefits of installing these new aerobic manure management techniques to systems other than
anaerobic lagoon facilities (under Iowa-specific conditions) would be different from those cited
in Vanotti’s studies. Thus, the analysis done for AFW-4 is likely a conservative estimate of the
emission reductions possible through manure management, because the policy considers only the
potential GHG reductions from improved management of anaerobic lagoons. Table I-4-5 shows
the implementation path used for this policy and the GHG benefits expected.

Management Costs
The costs of this policy were estimated based on a study by Vanotti and Szogi,41 which found
that these new methods of manure management resulted in a net savings of $0.75/head. Costs are
negative because of the improved health (and therefore sale price) of pigs as a result of this
cleaner manure management system. This cost figure assumes the sale of carbon credits for an
additional revenue stream. It was discounted back to 2005 dollars and applied to pig farms under
the policy in Iowa. The estimated pig populations come from the Iowa I&F, and the cost
estimates come from multiplying the pig population under the improved manure management

Key Assumptions:
The manure management costs assume that carbon credits can be aggregated and sold.
Revenue from the production tax credit42 was not included in this analysis. While this tax credit
may be available to systems put into place prior to January 1, 2012, it is not included in this
analysis to reflect the true cost of implementation.
Key Uncertainties
Some swine farms in Iowa may already have digesters in place, which were taken into account in
the BAU estimate. Because no information was available on the level of manure management
currently in place in Iowa, it was assumed that installation of additional digesters is practical in
all locations.
The Vanotti et al. studies43,44 assume that the improved manure handling and storage practices
occur on large facilities (>6,000 head per facility). The availability of facilities this large in Iowa
42

Section 476C of the Iowa code provides for a renewable energy tax credit, which includes biomass. The
production tax credit is equal to $4.50/MMBtu of methane gas was available to biogas recovery facilities (anaerobic
digester systems) which were placed into service on or after July 1, 2005, and before January 1, 2012.

may be somewhat limited, and some of the economies of scale used in the study may not be
available in practice.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Improved manure management often has additional benefits in terms of avoided odors and local
air pollutants.
Methane production from manure may reduce the nutrient level of manure and reduce its
potential to replace inorganic commercial fertilizer.
Feasibility Issues
The feasibility of utilizing methane and displacing natural gas or electricity may be limited by
on-farm or community energy requirements and/or the location of industries that could use that
energy.
This analysis suggests that there are economic benefits to implementing methane utilization at
dairy farms, which suggests that there are non-economic barriers to implementation, including
lack of economies of scale (i.e., size of dairy farms), seasonal variability (i.e., reduced winter
methane production), and limited demand by nearby industries.

AFW-5. Land Management to Promote Sequestration Benefits

Policy Description
On cultivated lands, the amount of carbon stored in the soil can be increased by the adoption of
practices, such as continuous conservation and no-till cultivation. By minimizing mechanical soil
disturbance, these practices reduce the oxidation of soil carbon compounds and allow more
stable aggregates to form. Other benefits include reduced wind and water erosion, reduced fuel
consumption, and improved wildlife habitat.
This policy option would convert marginal agricultural land used for annual crops to permanent
cover, such as grassland/rangeland, orchard, or forest, where the soil carbon or carbon in biomass
is higher under the new land use. It would also adopt mechanisms to discourage theses acres
from returning to either conventionally tilled production or suburban/urban development.
Heavy grazing can cause significant soil disturbance and result in carbon losses from soils.
Rotational grazing, where animals are regularly moved from field to field, can reduce soil
disturbance, improve plant vigor, and enhance soil carbon levels.
This policy option would also establish forests on land that has not historically been forested
(e.g., afforestation of agricultural land) and promote forest cover and associated carbon stocks by
regenerating or establishing forests in areas with little or no present forest cover (reforestation),
and would maintain and improve the health and longevity of trees in urban and residential areas
to protect and enhance the carbon stored in tree biomass. Indirect emissions reductions may also
occur by reducing heating and cooling needs as a result of planting shade trees.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Conservation tillage—By 2020, manage 75% of annual cropland with continuous no-till or
low-till production practices.
•

Agricultural land conversion—By 2020, convert 333,000 acres of marginal agricultural land
to higher-sequestration permanent cover (including grassland, rangeland, or orchard).

•

Conservation grazing—By 2020, apply conservation grazing practices, including rotational
grazing, to 50% of Iowa grazing lands.

•

Forestation—By 2020, establish 250,000 acres of new forestlands, and improve management
practices on 500,000 acres of unmanaged grazed forested land.

•

Urban forestry—By 2020, increase the canopy cover of urban forest in Iowa communities by
25%.

Timing: As stated above.
Parties Involved: Landowners and forest managers.

I-37

Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Encouraging landowner participation in the Iowa Forest Reserve Law program would enhance
afforestation and forest retention efforts.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Iowa Forest Reserve Law:
“Forests and woodlands provide many benefits to Iowans and their visitors. Iowans earn millions of
dollars each year from the harvest of timber and the manufacturing of wood and wood fiber products.
On steep slopes and ridgetops, forests prevent erosion of soils and subsequent pollution of lakes and
streams. In addition, forests provide habitat for a wide variety of game and non-game wildlife; they
provide a pleasant environment for many recreation activities such as hiking, camping, picnicking, and
hunting; and they add a great deal of beauty and diversity to the Iowa landscape. To encourage proper
stewardship of these woodlands, the Iowa Forest Reserve Law provides that forest land that meets
certain criteria may be exempt from property taxes.”45

The forestland must meet certain size and tree species criteria, and livestock are not permitted.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Increases the sequestration of carbon and prevent the carbon currently stored in Iowa’s
forests and farmland from being released. Reductions also occur, because soil carbon levels in
crop soils are increased above BAU levels. Increasing the levels of carbon in soils indirectly
sequesters carbon from the atmosphere.

Quantification Methods:
Conservation Tillage GHG Benefits
Total cropland in Iowa was estimated at about 23 million acres46 in 1998. For the purposes of
this analysis, conservation tillage is defined as any system that leaves 50% or more of the soil
covered with residue.47
Based on the policy design parameters, the schedule for acres to be put into conservation
tillage/no-till cultivation is displayed in Table I-5-2. This table represents the percentage of
cropland required by this policy option, less the area currently implementing conservation tillage.

46

1998 Iowa total cropland from the Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC) Iowa Crop Residue
Management Survey (see http://www.conservationinformation.org/index.asp?site=1&action=crm_results).
47

The definitions of tillage practices from the Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC) are used under
this policy. However, only no-till/strip-till and ridge-till are considered “conservation tillage” practices. No-till
means leaving the residue from last year’s crop undisturbed until planting. Strip-till means no more than a third of
the row width is disturbed with a coulter, residue manager, or specialized shank that creates a strip. If shanks are
used, nutrients may be injected at the same time. Ridge-till means that 4–6-inch-high ridges are formed at
cultivation. Planters using specialized attachments scrape off the top 2 inches of the ridge before placing the seed in
the ground.

I-39

In 1998, according to the Conservation Technology Information Center (CTIC),48 almost 4
million acres were using conservation tillage practices in Iowa. This represents approximately
17% of total cropland in Iowa.

MMtCO2e = million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.

For the policy period, it is assumed that the sequestration rate provided by the Chicago Climate
Exchange (CCX) for the carbon credit program (0.6 tCO2/acre/year because Iowa is considered
to be in CCX Zone A) is indicative of the sequestration that would occur as a result of improved
tillage practices.49 Thus, 0.6 tCO2/acre/year was used to estimate the amount of carbon to be
sequestered per acre. The issuance rates are viewed as a discounted average that could be
expected to occur for the entire pool of enrolled acreage over the 5-year contract period.50 It was
assumed that carbon accumulation occurred for 20 years, which extends beyond the policy
period. To estimate carbon stored each year, the annual accumulation rate was multiplied by the
number of acres still accumulating carbon each year. The CCX program currently runs until
2010, and while it is likely that the program will be extended, at this stage, it is not known
whether that will be the case.
Additional GHG savings from reduced fossil fuel consumption are estimated by multiplying the
fossil diesel emission factor and diesel fuel reduction per acre estimate. The reduction in fossil

diesel fuel use from the adoption of conservation tillage methods is 3.5 gal/acre.51 The life-cycle
fossil diesel GHG emission factor of 12.31 tCO2e/1,000 gal was used.52 Results are shown in
Table F-5-3, along with a total estimated benefit from carbon sequestration and fossil fuel
reductions.
Conservation Tillage Costs
The costs of adopting soil management practices (e.g., conservation tillage/no-till practices)
presented in Table I-5-3 are based on the financial incentives provided through the Minnesota
Agriculture Best Management Practices (Ag BMP) program.53 This program provides lowinterest loans to farmers as an incentive to initiate or improve their current tillage practices. The
equipment funded is generally specialized tillage or planting implements that leave crop residues
covering at least 15%–30% of the ground after planting. The average total cost for this
equipment is $23,000, though the average loan for tillage equipment is $16,000. The average size
of a farm that uses an Ag BMP loan to purchase conservation tillage equipment is 984 acres.
Based on the average loan size ($16,000) and the average size of the farm utilizing the loan (984
acres), it is assumed that a once-off loan of $16.26/acre is required to incentivize the adoption of
conservation tillage practices. This per-acre loan payment is applied to each new acre entering
the program to determine the approximate cost of encouraging the use of soil management
practices. Note that while initial up-front incentives may be required to encourage the use of soil
management practices, there may also be savings associated with reduced costs of fuel, labor,
chemicals, and equipment.54 The reduction in fossil diesel fuel use from the adoption of
conservation tillage methods is 3.5 gal/acre.55 The GHG emission factor for life-cycle fossil
diesel is assumed to be 12.31 tCO2e/1,000 gal.56

Agricultural Land Conversion GHG Benefits
The GHG sequestration benefits of converting marginal agricultural land to higher sequestration
permanent cover were quantified by assuming a constant rate of carbon accumulation of
1 tCO2e/acre/year.58 The sequestration rate was applied to acres in the program as indicated in
Table 5-3. The benefits from reduced use of diesel fuel and reduced use of fertilizer were
calculated using a method similar to that used for AFW-1. It was assumed that nitrogen was not
applied under the policy scenario but was applied in the reference case at a rate of 84 lb/acre,59
and the average CO2 emissions factor was 5.02 × 10–6 MMtCO2e/tN applied based on historical
data and the life cycle emissions factor for nitrogen production (i.e., emissions associated with
the production, transport, and energy consumption during application).60 Additional GHG

Agricultural Land Conversion Costs
The cost of the program was assumed to be constant over the period at $146/acre/year in 2008
dollars.63 The establishment costs were assumed to be $86/acre. The one-time establishment fee
is based on the average establishment costs provided by the ISU study.64 It is further assumed
that the federal government (through USDA) will pay up to 50% of these establishment costs
The estimate provided for the U.S. (taken from West and Marland, 2002) was 857.5 grams (g) CO2e/kgN, or 0.778
tCO2e/tN.

It was assumed that carbon credits ($4/tCO2) would be generated through the CCX or a similar
future program.65 Cost savings were also assumed to occur through reduced nutrient application
and fuel consumption, using a method similar to that applied above.66 These costs are discounted
to 2005 dollars and are assumed to be constant in real terms across the policy period. Costs for
each year are indicated in Table I-5-5.

Conservation Grazing GHG Benefits
The GHG benefits of rotational grazing were estimated using the low end of the range provided
by the CCX offset protocol for rangeland soil carbon management.67 Offsets are issued at
standard rates, depending on project type and location. Iowa has not been placed in a zone, and
rates vary from 0.12 to 0.52 tCO2e/acre/year. As a conservative estimate, the midpoint of this
range was assumed (0.32 tCO2e/acre/year). The sequestration rate depends on the determination
of whether the range is in a non-degraded or degraded condition. It was assumed that this rate of

Conservation Grazing Costs
Unlike with land conversion programs, there is only a change of management practices, and thus
there are no land conversion costs. It was assumed that carbon credits ($4/tCO2) would be
generated through the CCX or a similar future program.68
In addition, there is likely to be annual income from the adoption of rotational grazing. The net
annual income is assumed to be $50/acre/year. This is based on assumed additional income of
$100/acre/year and assumed additional labor costs of adopting rotation grazing of $50/acre/year.
To achieve this additional income, there are other up-front capital costs for fencing and watering
systems (assumed to be $200/acre).69 These costs are assumed to be in 2005 dollars and to be
constant in real terms across the policy period. Costs for each year are indicated in Table I-5-6.
Afforestation GHG Benefits
Forests grown or planted on land not currently in forest cover will most likely accumulate carbon
at a rate consistent with the accumulation rates of average forests in the region. Therefore,

carbon sequestered by afforestation can be assumed to occur at the same rate as carbon
sequestration in average Iowa forests. For this analysis, it was assumed that afforested land
would have otherwise been used for annual crop production.
Average carbon storage was found using methods described in USFS GTR-NE-343, assuming
that afforestation activity would create forests consistent with the existing forest type distribution
in Iowa. This distribution was based on USDA USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis data.
Afforestation statewide was assumed to occur on 50% oak/hickory, 25% elm/ash/cottonwood,
and 25% maple/beech/birch forests.
For afforestation calculations, annual carbon sequestration rates in each forest type group were
calculated by subtracting carbon stocks in new stands (0 years old) from carbon stocks in 35year-old stands and dividing by 35 years. A weighted statewide average carbon sequestration rate
for afforestation activity was calculated, taking into account the variation in carbon sequestration
across forest types (Table I-5-7). The 35-year period was chosen to reflect the average length of
an afforestation project period. In this afforestation calculation, soil carbon was taken into
account. Soil carbon was assumed to accumulate at a rate consistent with soil carbon
accumulation in afforested stands in GTR-NE-343.
Since afforested land would otherwise have been used for agricultural production, an additional
GHG benefit of afforestation is the reduction of emissions from diesel fuel used to power farm
equipment. This GHG benefit was considered to be parallel to expected reductions resulting from
a switch to conservation tillage, as described above. GHG emission reductions associated with
reduced management intensity were thus estimated by multiplying the fossil diesel emission
factor (12.31 tCO2e/1,000 gal)70 by the diesel fuel reduction per acre (3.5 gal/acre).71

To achieve the goal of afforesting 250,000 acres by 2020, it was assumed that 20,833 acres
would be planted each year from 2009 to 2020. Forests planted in one year continue to sequester
carbon in subsequent years. Thus carbon storage in a given year was calculated as the sum of
annual carbon sequestration on cumulative planted acreage. To determine the total amount of
carbon sequestered from 2009 to 2020, the number of acres planted in that year and all prior
years was multiplied by the average annual carbon sequestration rate for each land-use type
(Table I-5-8).

Afforestation Costs and Benefits
Cost analyses of vegetation planting typically use four categories: (1) opportunity cost (of
planting forest rather than another, potentially more lucrative land use); (2) conversion cost; (3)
maintenance cost; and (4) measuring/monitoring costs (Walker et al. 2007).
The opportunity cost for afforestation activity was assumed to be $106.15/acre/year, which was
the annual average rental payment to farmers in Iowa with land enrolled in the CRP as of 2007.72
One-time costs of vegetation establishment include site preparation and vegetation planting. For
afforestation activity in Iowa, the Forest Land Enhancement Program indicates the willingness to
cost-share 75% of the total project cost, to a maximum of $600/acre.73 The full cost of

afforestation activity, including site preparation and planting, was thus estimated at 100% of a
typical project cost, or $800/acre. Maintenance and monitoring costs on afforested land were
assumed to be negligible between 2009 and 2020. It was further assumed that carbon credits due
to afforestation activity would be available at a rate of $4/tCO2e for the carbon sequestration
portion of the GHG benefit.74 Revenue from harvested wood was not included, because timber
harvest is not likely to occur over the policy implementation period from 2009 to 2020. To
calculate the economic benefit of selling carbon credits, the carbon stored in cumulative planted
acreage was discounted by 30%, and this carbon sequestration estimate was multiplied by the
price per credit ($4.00/tCO2e).
Discounted costs to 2020 were calculated using a 5% discount rate. Results, including annual
costs, are summarized in Table I-5-9. The cost of implementing this option, expressed in 2005
dollars, was calculated to be $54.62/tCO2 stored or avoided.

GHG Benefit of Improved Management Practices on Unmanaged Grazed Forested Land
Enhanced carbon sequestration can occur on land that is currently grazed if livestock are
excluded and trees are allowed to grow. This option quantifies the impact of livestock exclusion
on 500,000 acres of currently unmanaged grazed forestland. The land treated under this policy
option is currently used for livestock grazing, and it is not part of the forested land base in Iowa
as defined by the USDA USFS. After this policy option is implemented, the land would most
likely be classified as forest in future inventories.

A relationship between forest stocking and existing carbon stocks in Iowa forests was created,
using current data on forest area and carbon stocks by stocking class75 (Figure I-5-1). It was
assumed that full policy implementation would result in a shift from a lower stocking class into
the next highest stocking class over a 20-year period. Specifically, nonstocked forests would
become poorly stocked as a result of livestock exclusion, poorly stocked forests would move into
the medium stocked category, and forests in a medium stocking class would move into the fully
stocked category. Of the 500,000 acres, it was assumed that 20% (100,000 acres) would
originally be in the nonstocked category, 200,000 acres (40%) would originally be in the poorly
stocked category, and the remaining 200,000 acres (40%) would originally be in the medium
stocked category (Table I-5-10).

To calculate the incremental carbon storage resulting from transition from a less-stocked to a
more-stocked forest condition, the difference in biomass carbon stocks between the current
stocking and the next-highest stocking class was calculated for nonstocked, poorly stocked, and
medium stocked classes, and was then divided by 20 to estimate the annual incremental carbon
storage due to increased stocking (Table I-5-10). A weighted average of 1.69 tCO2e/acre/year
was calculated to represent the average carbon storage resulting from implementation of this

To reach the goal of 500,000 acres by 2020, a linear ramp-up to the goal level was assumed such
that 41,667 acres were added to the program each year. These acres were assumed to be
proportionally representative, such that one-twelfth of the acres in the nonstocked, poorly
stocked, and medium stocked categories would be added in each of the 12 years between 2009
and 2020. The cumulative impact of the policy option (2009–2020) is 5.48 MMtCO2e (Table I-511).

Improved Management Practices on Unmanaged Grazed Forested Land: Economic Costs
The cost of implementing this option is essentially the cost of livestock exclusion, since the land
is currently growing trees and is not used for agriculture. No planting is necessary, and
maintenance is minimal. It was assumed that fencing would be used to exclude livestock from
forested acreage, that the average fenced parcel would be 40 acres in size, and that fencing would
be installed on half of the perimeter of the parcel. The fencing cost was assumed to be
$1.76/foot; this is a one-time cost associated with policy implementation.76 In addition, an annual
cost of $30/acre was assumed; this is an ongoing payment to landowners to encourage livestock
exclusion from forested parcels.77 The net present value (NPV) of this option, expressed in 2005
dollars, is $93.7 million (Table I-5-12). The cost-effectiveness of this option is $17.11/tCO2e.

Urban Forestry GHG Benefit
Carbon Sequestration in Urban Trees
The average annual per-tree gross carbon sequestration value for urban trees was determined by
dividing the total estimated annual carbon sequestration in Iowa urban trees (313,000 tCO2/year,
equating to 1.15 million tCO2e/year) by the total number of urban trees. Annual gross carbon
sequestration per urban tree was thus calculated as 0.006 tCO2/tree/year (0.022 tCO2e/tree/year).
Gross sequestration as calculated above does not account for the emissions resulting from tree
mortality, disposal, and decomposition. To account for these emissions, the estimated gross
carbon sequestration per tree was multiplied by 0.72, which is the ratio of gross to net
76

Iowa DNR reimburses landowners at a rate of $0.88/foot to install standard barbed-wire fencing for livestock
exclusion, which is 50% of the total fencing cost. Personal communication, Larry Beeler (NRCS Assistant State
Conservationist) with J. Jenkins, Center for Climate Strategies (CCS), August 20, 2008.

sequestration for urban trees reported by Nowak and Crane (2002)78 and used in EPA’s Inventory
of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks.79 Annual net carbon sequestration per urban tree
in Iowa is 0.004 tCO2/tree/year (0.015 tCO2e/tree/year).
Since trees planted in one year continue to accumulate carbon in subsequent years, annual carbon
sequestration in any given year was calculated as the sum of carbon stored in trees planted in that
year plus sequestration by trees that were planted in prior years. It was assumed that new trees
planted in urban areas in Iowa would sequester carbon at a rate consistent with sequestration by
the average urban trees statewide.
Avoided Fossil Fuel Emissions
GHG reductions from avoided fossil fuel use for heating and cooling can occur as a result of
planting trees that provide additional shade and wind protection to buildings, though these
benefits are not likely to be achieved the first year after planting. Normally, trees are quite small
when they are planted, so some time is required before the full effect of the avoided emissions
can be realized. To account for this, a sliding scale was used, such that trees planted in 2009
would achieve the full avoided GHG emissions benefit 20 years after planting (in 2029), and a
linear phase-in of avoided GHG benefits would occur each year. Avoided GHG benefits for trees
planted in each year from 2009 to 2020 were thus calculated proportionally to their expected size
in 2029, as shown in Table I-5-13. Using this approach, it was assumed that the trees planted in
2009 would achieve their full shade and wind protection potential (shown in Table I-5-14) in
2029, well after the conclusion of the 2009–2020 policy implementation period.
The total avoided GHG benefits are a function of three different types of impacts: reduced
cooling demand, reduced demand for heating due to wind reduction, and increased demand for
heating due to wintertime shading. An average potential GHG reduction factor of 0.054
tCO2e/tree/year for trees in the North Central region was calculated from data in McPherson and
Simpson in GTR-PSW-171.80 The estimate assumed that the trees planted are split among
residential settings with pre-1950, 1950–1980, and post-1980 homes using the default
distribution for the North Central region provided by McPherson and Simpson of 42%, 48%, and
10%, respectively. This estimate further assumes a default distribution of trees planted around
buildings, based on measured data from existing urban canopy in the region.

To calculate potential avoided GHG emissions due to increased shading, it was assumed that all
of the new trees are planted where they have a shading effect. Because these data were used as
potential maxima, large trees planted (half evergreen, half deciduous) and the average tree
distribution around buildings were also assumed. Note that these fossil fuel reduction factors are
average for existing buildings and do not necessarily assume that trees are optimally placed
around buildings to maximize energy efficiency. These factors are also dependent on the
electricity fuel mix (e.g., coal, hydroelectric, nuclear) in the regions of interest and may thus
change if the mix changes. The average urban tree planted in Iowa was assumed to result in
avoided emissions of 0.055 tCO2e/year (Tables I-5-14 and I-5-15).

The annual avoided GHG benefit of trees in each year of the policy implementation period was
calculated proportionally to the expected size of the trees in each age cohort in each year (Table
I-5-16). For each year between 2009 and 2020, this was calculated by multiplying the number of
trees planted in each preceding year by the maximum potential avoided GHG effect. This was
then multiplied by the scaling factor (Table I-5-13) that represents the proportion of the
maximum benefit achieved in a given year by trees planted in a prior year. For each year of
policy implementation, the shade- and wind-protection effects of trees planted in that year and
each prior year were summed to find the total avoided GHG impact of urban tree planting in that
year (Table I-5-16).

Since the full benefit of urban tree planting is not likely to be realized during the 11-year policy
implementation period between 2009 and 2020, a separate analysis was also conducted to
quantify the GHG benefit over the 40 years following the 11-year implementation period. This
analysis assumed that the full GHG fossil fuel offset benefit of urban tree planting would be
realized 20 years after tree planting, such that trees planted at the end of the policy
implementation period (in 2020) would reach their full shading potential in 2039. The effects of
trees planted between 2009 and 2020 were considered, but their benefits were calculated over the
40-year period to 2048. Results of this analysis are shown in Table I-5-18.

Urban Forestry Costs
Data are available on the costs and cost savings of urban tree planting in the Midwest
(McPherson 2006)81. The economic costs of tree planting take into account the cost of tree

planting and annual maintenance costs, including the costs of program administration and waste
disposal. The economic benefits of tree planting include the cost avoided from reduced energy
use. Data are also available on the estimated economic benefits of services (e.g., provision of
clean air), hydrologic benefits (e.g., storm water control), and aesthetic enhancement. However,
these co-benefits are not explicitly included in the analysis.
Costs and cost savings were estimated from published average annual costs and cost savings over
40 years, provided by public and private parties for a range of tree sizes. The cost estimate used
in this analysis, $26.38/tree, was calculated as the average of small, medium, and large trees
under public and private management. A cost savings of –$28.03/tree/year was also calculated as
the average of small, medium, and large trees under public and private management. The average
cost and cost savings values yield a net cost savings of –$1.65/tree (costs minus cost savings).
Table I-5-19 shows estimated economic costs and cost savings for all categories.

The cost savings is estimated using 40-year averages; thus, it represents lifetime costs applicable
in the year planted and every year thereafter during the time frame of this analysis (e.g., planting
costs $80/tree in the year the tree is planted; however, the 40-year average cost is $10/tree). To
estimate total cost savings, –$1.65/tree was multiplied by the cumulative number of trees planted
each year (Table I-5-20). This corresponds to a cumulative cost saving (or NPV) of –$99 million
from 2009 to 2020, with an estimated economic cost of –$21.84/tCO2e. Over the 40-year period
from 2009 to 2038, the NPV of this option is –$287 million, with an estimated economic cost of
–$11.39/tCO2e.

Key Assumptions:
The agriculture analyses are based on the sequestration rate provided by CCX.
A once-off loan is required to incentivize the adoption of conservation tillage practices.
The GHG benefits of rotational grazing were estimated using the low end of the range provided
by the CCX rangeland soil carbon management offset protocol. As a conservative estimate, the
midpoint of this range was assumed (0.32 tCO2e/acre/year). It was further assumed that this rate
of accumulation occurred for the duration of the policy period.
Carbon credits will be generated through the CCX or a similar future program.
Key Uncertainties
The rate of soil carbon sequestration and time period for which sequestration occurs are areas of
uncertainty and are ultimately dependent on site-specific conditions, such as soil quality, climatic
conditions, and management practices.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Ancillary benefits from afforestation, such as avoided costs of pollution abatement, are not
included in the cost savings. Improvements to barren lands accrued by returning to forestlands
include increased local property values due to improved aesthetics, reduced amount and speed of
runoff (reducing sedimentation, increasing water quality, and enhancing soil water retention),
and improved wildlife habitat.
In addition to the numerous benefits articulated in the policy description, urban trees contribute
to improved property values, add aesthetic values to residents and visitors, balance humidity, and
I-58

reduce the intensity of stormwater runoff. Sociological studies suggest that neighborhoods that
are more attractive and comfortable have lower crime rates.
Feasibility Issues
Once trees are planted, it could take 6–18 years before measurable carbon sequestration is
achieved.

AFW-6. Cellulosic Biofuel

Policy Description
Promote research and production of sustainable in-state fuels derived from cellulose (biomass) to
displace the use of conventional petroleum-based fuels. Promote the in-state development of
cellulosic feedstocks (including perennials) that can be utilized for the production of cellulosic
fuels. Promote research into conversion technologies, such as thermochemical Fischer-Tropsch
processes and enzymatic conversion, to facilitate their development.
Promote cellulosic biofuel production systems that improve the embedded energy content, life
cycle, and carbon profile of biofuels. Focus on plant material feedstocks that favor energy
production and are carbon neutral or negative and have multiple positive environmental benefits,
such as maintaining carbon sequestration potential and soil productivity, and decreasing water
and fossil fuel inputs during their production. This could help provide a strong economic market
within the state and reduce GHG emissions through avoided fossil fuel consumption.
Note that this option is focused on the supply-side aspects of promoting biofuels, with an
emphasis on the development of feedstocks and production technologies. The demand-side
aspects of renewable fuels (including cellulosic biofuels) are being addressed under TLU-10
(Fuel Strategies [20% Low Carbon Fuel Standard]).
Policy Design
Goals: Increase in-state cellulosic feedstock production by 10 million dry tons by 2020.
Timing: Full implementation by 2020.
Parties Involved: State of Iowa, farmers, biofuel producers, distributors, fuel retailers, fuel
wholesalers, business owners, and relevant agriculture and trade associations.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Tax incentives,

•

State and federal cost-share programs for energy crop establishment,

•

USDA value-added agriculture development grants,

•

Federal Renewable Fuel Standard,

•

Cellulosic fuel requirement standards and incentives,

•

Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Life-cycle emissions are reduced to the extent that biofuels are produced with lower
embedded fossil-based carbon than conventional (fossil) fuel. Feedstocks used for producing
biofuels can be made from crops or other biomass that contain carbon sequestered during
photosynthesis (e.g., biogenic or short-term carbon).
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2012, 2020 (MMtCO2e): 2.0 and 9.8, respectively.
Net Cost per tCO2e: –$29.
Data Sources: Identified in methodology below.
Quantification Methods:
Biofuel GHG Reductions
For ethanol, the benefits for this option are dependent on developing in-state production capacity
that achieves benefits beyond those of petroleum fuels.
The incremental benefit of cellulosic production targeted by this policy over gasoline is 9.79
tCO2e reduced/1,000 gal. The emission factor value is based on the difference between the lifecycle CO2e emission factor of gasoline (10.30 t/1,000 gal)82 and the life-cycle CO2e emission
factor of cellulosic ethanol (1.38 t/1,000 gal).83 Emission factors for gasoline and cellulosic
ethanol are based on Argonne National Laboratory’s (ANL’s) Greenhouse Gases, Regulated
Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model.84 The cellulosic benefit value
will be used along with the production in each year to estimate GHG reductions.
Table I-6-1 shows the number of cellulosic production plants that will need to go online in Iowa
to achieve the goal of using 10 million short tons of feedstock annually. This analysis is
primarily based on an NREL report regarding the capital costs of building a 69.3-milliongal/year cellulosic ethanol production plant that uses corn stover as the feedstock. The emissions
reductions from this plant are calculated by multiplying the number of gallons produced in a
given year by the emission reduction per gallon (9.79 tCO2e/1,000 gal).

Biofuel Costs
The costs of this option are estimated based on the capital and operating costs of cellulosic
ethanol production plants. An NREL study estimated that total capital costs for a 70-milliongal/year cellulosic ethanol plant would be $200 million.85 An EIA study cited a major biofuels
manufacturer who estimated the costs of a first-of-its-kind 50-million-gal/year cellulosic ethanol
plant to be $375 million.86 An average of these costs was used in the estimate of capital costs. A
new plant will need to be built for every 70 million gallons of annual ethanol production needed.
It is assumed that the capital costs will be paid according to a cost recovery factor over the 20year lifetime of the plant. O&M costs were also taken from the NREL study. The cost of biomass
feedstocks made up a significant portion (approximately 60%) of variable costs. Therefore, the
NREL estimate of feedstock costs ($30/ton) was replaced with a more current estimate of the
cost of delivered biomass ($105/ton, which is the average of $74/ton for corn stover87 and

involved in feedstock costs.) The plant proposed by the NREL study produces some excess
electricity, so the projected price of electricity from the Iowa common assumptions document is
used to show the value of electricity sold to the grid by the plant. Another revenue source for the
ethanol plant is the value of the ethanol produced. The wholesale price of ethanol was taken from
AEO 2008 and was multiplied by the number of gallons produced annually.89 (See the Key
Uncertainties section for discussion of sensitivity to ethanol price.) In addition, it was assumed
that a $1.01/gal federal tax credit for cellulosic ethanol is available from the Farm Bill (the Food,
Conservation and Energy Act of 2008, H.R. 2419).90 Table I-6-2 outlines the estimated cost and
revenue streams for the policy. The total cost of the policy for 2008–2020, discounted to 2005
dollars, is estimated to be a net savings of $1,409 million.

Emission factors for gasoline and cellulosic ethanol are based on the ANL GREET model.
The costs of this option are estimated based on the capital and operating costs of cellulosic
ethanol production plants.
The wholesale price of ethanol was taken from AEO 2008. A federal tax credit for cellulosic
ethanol of $1.01/gal was assumed.
Key Uncertainties
Sensitivity to oil and other fuel costs—The cost competitiveness of biofuels will depend on the
cost of oil. Ethanol prices are sensitive to crude oil prices. In addition, as other fuel prices
increase, transporting biomass to various ethanol plants will be more expensive.
Sensitivity to feedstock cost—The cost of the feedstock contributes a great deal of uncertainty to
this option. The quantification assumed 50% switchgrass and 50% corn stover feedstock. For
producers to grow switchgrass, it will have to have a competitive operation margin and be as
profitable as other crops that they could grow or be competitive with pastureland rents. For
example, a farmer growing corn with a yield of 145 bushels per acre could produce it at a cost of
$4.17/bushel.91 The current Chicago Board of Trade corn price is $5.65/bushel,92 creating a
profit of $215/acre. If this farmer also sold the corn stover for $57/ton, which is the average
between the maximum livestock producers would be willing to pay for corn stover as feed and
the cost of corn stover production and transportation,93 then the profits increase to $253/acre.
Assuming a switchgrass yield of 8 tons/acre, switchgrass would need to be selling at a $32
profit/ton to compete with the profits from corn. Producers will not grow energy crops unless
they can make a profit. There is wide variability in potential income based on ethanol and oil
prices. It will be difficult to produce a high volume of ethanol without a high contribution of
biomass from energy crops.
Sensitivity to the wholesale price of ethanol—The cost or net revenue associated with production
of cellulosic ethanol is extremely sensitive to the wholesale price of ethanol. The calculation was
rerun using the current price of ethanol ($2.61 as of August 1, 2008,94 deflated to 2005 dollars).
The result is a net revenue of $68 million in 2010, a net revenue of $476 million in 2020, and a
total net revenue for the policy period of 2008–2020 of $2,790 million, discounted to 2005

dollars. The uncertainty of future ethanol prices contributes a great degree of uncertainty to this
policy quantification.
Carbon emissions from land-use change—Recent publications, such as Searchinger et al., 2008,
have attempted to estimate the carbon emissions that result from land use being converted from
forest to cropland to grow crops for fuel.95 This is based on the argument that the conversion of
current cropland from food/feed/fiber production in one part of the world will reduce the
food/feed/fiber supply on the market and drive grassland or forest conversion to cropland in
other parts of the world. There is still significant uncertainty regarding the value of carbon
emissions resulting from land-use change. Additionally, conversion of cropland to fuel
production may have impacts on food prices and supply.
Cost of cellulosic ethanol production—EIA has stated:
“Capital costs for a first-of-a-kind cellulosic ethanol plant with a capacity of 50 million gallons per
year are estimated by one leading producer to be $375 million (2005 dollars), as compared with $67
million for a corn-based plant of similar size, and investment risk is high for a large-scale cellulosic
ethanol production facility. Other studies have provided lower cost estimates. A detailed study by the
National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2002 estimated total capital costs for a cellulosic ethanol
plant with a capacity of 69.3 million gallons per year at $200 million.”96

This NREL study uses an average of these two estimates throughout the policy period, but it is
more likely that the earlier plants will have higher costs and later plants will be less expensive as
understanding of cellulosic production increases.
It is uncertain if the federal subsidy on cellulosic ethanol will continue throughout the policy
period.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Biochar—Biochar is a by-product of certain thermochemical energy production processes. The
application of biochar to crop fields is believed to increase both soil productivity and soil carbon
levels. The land application of biochar should be conducted, even though the level of GHG
benefits is not fully understood and additional research is required.
Biorefineries may use excess agricultural waste products from the ethanol production process as
an electricity source, decreasing their reliance on such sources as natural gas. This can provide
economic and GHG benefits.
The electricity being sold to the grid is likely to replace electricity production already taking
place and, therefore, could have significant GHG benefits. Since the emissions from the ethanol
plant are already calculated into the life-cycle emissions of the fuel sold, electricity produced in

this manner is likely to have no emissions. The GHG benefits of this electricity sold may be
significant, but were not calculated into this analysis.
The in-state production of biofuels provides an energy security benefit through reduced reliance
on foreign oil.
Feasibility Issues
Implementation of this option requires additional research and development in cellulosic ethanol
production methods, development of feedstock collection and delivery infrastructure, and
successful negotiations with cellulosic technology leaders to establish pilot and commercial-scale
plants in the state. Sourcing of feedstocks and the size and location of facilities (crushing and
biodiesel production) must be addressed for optimization and planning. Trade-offs between food
and fuel crops will be an important issue.
There may be an overlap among agricultural options that seek to increase and maintain crop
acreage in no-till production or in conservation management programs. This could be in conflict
with the higher levels of crop production proposed in this option.

Renewable energy can be produced and used on site at agriculture operations. For example,
installing solar or wind power, using hydropowered generators for irrigation, and converting
diesel farm equipment to more efficient or renewable energy technology will reduce CO2
emissions. The use of energy-efficient products, such as improved grain dryers, heat exchangers
(dairy), electric motors, and energy-efficient building design, should also be promoted.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Renewable energy—Increase renewable energy use at agriculture operations by 10% by
2020.
•

Energy efficiency—Increase the energy efficiency of on-farm operations by 30% by 2020.

Timing: As stated above.
Parties Involved: Farmers and land managers.
Other: None identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
Mechanisms to encourage the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency measures could
include energy audit programs, incentives, or subsidies. Potential technologies that could be used
to improve on-farm efficiencies include efficient grain dryers and more efficient electric motors.
Other technologies are considered in this analysis, but it is likely that they have similar costs.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
None identified.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Improved efficiency can reduce electricity and fuel consumption and the associated GHGs.

Data Sources:
Renewable energy—Iowa Renewable Resource Energy Guide97 may be valuable in estimating
the costs of various renewable energy technologies on a small scale. If this policy is intended to
install on-farm renewable energy on a large scale, then different cost estimates will be used, such
as the 2006 EIA report Assumptions for the Annual Energy Outlook 2006: With Projections to
2025.98
Energy efficiency—Consumption of distillate fuel by the agriculture sector in Iowa was projected
from historical data provided by EIA.99 The petrodiesel emissions factor used is consistent with
the California Climate Action Registry (10.05 tCO2e/1,000 gal).100 The costs of efficient pump
technology come from the "2003 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey"101 and EPA.102 Fuel savings
estimates for tire inflation come from the AgTech Center.103 Agricultural sector electricity
consumption was derived from the National Agricultural Statistics Service,104 and historical
electricity prices were from EIA.105 In addition, Roger Wolf and Heath Elson at the Iowa
Soybean Association were contacted to get estimates on the costs of an energy efficiency
program in Iowa.
Quantification Methods:
Renewable Energy GHG Benefits
Potential renewable energy options available for Iowa farmers include wind, solar photovoltaics,
solar thermal heating, and geothermal energy. Methane utilization is considered under AFW-4
and will not be covered here. A reasonable mix of these technologies will be based on Iowa’s
specific circumstances and will be informed by the statewide energy portfolio. Table I-7-2 shows

The GHG benefits were quantified on the basis of emission differences between the renewable
portfolio and the grid electricity that it is replacing. The analysis assumes that renewable energy
will be used to replace 10% of on-farm electricity. The BAU projections of electricity use come
from the Iowa I&F using the electricity consumption estimates for 2005–2020. The share being
consumed in on-farm use was calculated by multiplying the national agricultural electricity use
by Iowa’s share of total agricultural emissions.
Renewable Energy Costs
The costs/benefits of incentivizing each technology were considered. Costs were based on the
portfolio of technologies considered and the different costs of each, as seen in Table I-7-3. The
costs and GHG benefits of the renewable energy option are shown in Tables I-7-4 and I-7-5.

Energy Efficiency GHG Benefits
This analysis also considered various technologies for reducing on-farm energy consumption,
such as education programs to explain the importance of correct tire inflation, improving the

I-70

efficiency of electrical and diesel water pumps, improving the efficiency of lighting, and
providing incentives for more efficient tractors. Other options, such as efficient grain dryers and
more efficient electric motors, could provide GHG benefits and will be utilized when farms
undertake the energy audit. The GHG benefits—calculated on the basis of emissions avoided
because of new technologies—could come in the form of fuel savings or reduced electricity
consumption. The total GHG benefit was calculated on the basis of emissions factors of the
various fuels (CO2e/Btu or gal) or electricity (CO2e/kWh). The BAU projections of electricity
use come from the Iowa I&F, using estimates for electricity consumption between 2005 and
2020. The share being consumed in on-farm use was calculated by multiplying national
agricultural electricity use by Iowa’s share of total agricultural emissions. By dividing the
amount of fuel sold for agricultural use in Iowa by the cost of a gallon of diesel fuel in 2006, the
BAU fuel use was determined (both figures from USDA). No growth in diesel fuel consumption
was assumed because of conflicting growth estimates. The savings for the energy efficiency
technologies considered did not meet the goal of the policy, so an energy audit program was also
included. This program will provide state funding for energy audits to improve the energy
efficiency of farms across Iowa. It is assumed that these audit programs will find energy
efficiency gains at a similar cost/benefit to that of the efficiency technologies considered in this
analysis.
Efficiency Costs
This analysis will be done by examining the cost of installing or optimally using various
technologies (e.g., more efficient pumps). To maximize pump efficiency, pumps must be tested
and replaced periodically, which requires a capital investment. Table I-7-6 shows the costs and
GHG benefits of one energy efficiency program considered—improving the efficiency of diesel
water pumps. This is the type of efficiency improvement that could be recommended from the
energy audit.

By using estimates of the total number of pumps potentially available in Iowa, the total costs of
this project can be determined. This total cost figure will be balanced against the fuel/electricity
savings that occur with such an efficiency investment. The diesel pump program includes the
costs of testing ($200/test, one test assumed every 5 years) and the cost of retrofitting older
pumps to be more efficient ($24,913).106 Since this results in an efficiency improvement of 41%,
on average, it will save more than 23,000 gallons during the lifetime of the pump.
The cost of the energy audit program is assumed to be $500,000 annually for staffing/travel costs
and $1,000 for every energy audit performed.107 The number of energy audits performed depends
on the amount of energy savings required to meet the energy efficiency goal for the year. Since
each of the energy efficiency programs considered in this analysis (e.g., efficient pumps, tire
inflation, and lighting) has negative net costs, the money spent on the energy audit program is
recouped throughout the period. Table I-7-7 shows the GHG savings for each year attained by
the example programs. Table I-7-8 shows the amount of savings still required to meet the policy
goal, which is assumed to come from the energy audit. Costs and savings from the energy
efficiency programs are discounted back to 2005 dollars.

conducted an energy audit program in Iowa where consultants were paid $500 to work with local farmers on
reducing field energy use. This estimate was doubled to account for auditing potential building/storage energy use.

Key Assumptions: The technologies considered as examples provide a reasonable picture of the
costs and benefits of energy efficiency improvements in the state.
Key Uncertainties
Renewable energy—The costs and capacity factors of the various renewable energy sources
considered could all change, based on fluctuations in the energy market and possible
technological improvements.
Energy efficiency—It is uncertain whether the energy efficiency gains being found in the energy
audit program are realistic. It is possible that some of the energy efficiency investments needed
to reach the goal of increasing on-farm efficiency by 30% will be quite expensive. If that is the
case, then the cost estimates will not be accurate.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Renewable energy—The benefits from distributed generation are not accounted for in this
analysis. Lower transmission losses and reduced investment in electrical infrastructure can serve
to make distributed renewable generation more cost-effective when implemented across the state.
•

Reduced grid demand, and therefore a reduction in other non-GHG pollutants related to
electricity generation.

Energy efficiency—Reduced non-GHG pollution caused by the combustion of diesel fuel.
•

Many of the strategies discussed in this section are shown to save water, labor hours, and
equipment wear.

I-73

Feasibility Issues
Renewable energy—Implementing renewable projects on a small scale (e.g., on-farm operations)
can often be difficult and expensive. This may be a limiting factor in the implementation of this
option.
Energy efficiency—Improving the availability of information to farm operators regarding
adjustments in equipment or practices (i.e., tire pressure) may not have a large impact on fuel
savings.
Status of Group Approval
Approved.
Level of Group Support
Unanimous.
Barriers to Consensus
None.

AFW-8. Waste Management Strategies

Policy Description
Reduce the volume of waste from residential, commercial, and government sectors through
programs that reduce the generation of wastes. Reducing generation at the source reduces landfill
emissions and upstream production emissions.
Increase recycling or reuse of waste to limit GHG emissions associated with landfill methane
generation and with the production and transport of products and packaging from virgin
materials (noting that different recycled materials will exhibit different costs and benefits on a
life-cycle basis). Increase recycling programs, create new recycling programs, provide incentives
for recycling construction materials, develop markets for recycled materials, and increase
average participation and recovery rates for all existing recycling programs.
Increase organics management programs, such as composting, to reduce GHG emissions
associated with landfilled organic waste.
Policy Design
Three approaches are possible: (1) recycling, (2) waste prevention, and (3) market-driven
approach—i.e., producer responsibility (voluntary and mandatory systems).
Goals:
• Waste prevention—Achieve a 5% per capita decrease in waste production (compared to that
in 2005) from residential, commercial, and government sectors by 2020.
•

Reuse and recycling—Increase the statewide recycling rate average to 50% by 2020
compared to the amount of waste produced. (If waste is minimized, then there will be less
material to recycle.)

•

Extended producer responsibility—Reach an agreement with manufacturers, producers, and
retailers to reduce by 10% the quantity of packaging on the market and pursue more
environmentally friendly packaging.

•

Life-cycle product stewardship—Work with U.S. industry to achieve life-cycle product
stewardship so that products are designed for reuse, repair (not planned obsolescence), and
recycling. Alternatively, shift the responsibility for managing discarded products and
packaging from local government to producers of products [nonquantified goal].

Timing: As stated above.
Parties Involved: Municipal solid waste (MSW) site owners and managers, recycling managers,
and waste collectors.

I-75

Other: In 2005, Iowa diverted 29.3% of generated MSW from landfills (Table I-8-1). The
recycling rate was 27.1%, and the composting rate was 2.1%. Compostable organics comprised
9.8% of the total waste generated, setting the upper bound for the composting goal.108

Data needed to estimate the future generation of MSW in Iowa are not available from the
resources on the IA DNR Web site. Therefore, the Center for Climate Strategies (CCS) assumed
that the per capita MSW generation rate would follow the same trend as the national MSW
generation rate. Table I-8-2 identifies the average annual increase in per capita MSW generation
as 0.14%.109 This results in an increase in waste generation from 1.28 tons/person/year in Iowa in
2005 to 1.30 tons/person/year in 2020.

Waste Prevention
• The route to waste prevention requires a combination of initiatives by manufacturers and
retailers, governmental intervention, and better informed consumers.
•

Waste prevention and recycling are at different ends of the spectrum. Recycling programs do
not further the goals of waste prevention.

•

The incentive for manufacturers, producers, and consumers to minimize waste is greatly
reduced when the emphasis is on municipal recycling programs.

•

There is insufficient awareness and understanding of the benefits and methodology of waste
prevention. The emphasis in the public and private sectors is predominantly on “end-of-pipe”
waste treatment, rather than on prevention.

•

With waste prevention, GHG emissions associated with waste disposal are avoided along
with all the emissions associated with extraction, manufacturing, and transport. Waste
prevention is genuinely sustainable resource management.

•

Manufacturing take-back programs create an incentive for waste minimization.

•

Consumer education on waste-related purchase behavior has little impact because consumers
have a tendency to rank price, convenience, and brand name as more critical than
environmental considerations.

•

EPA estimates that for each person participating in a pay-as-you-throw program, GHG
emissions are reduced by an average of 0.312 tCO2e.110

Recycling
• Goals of ever higher recycling targets will have higher costs. There is increasing demand for
more materials to be added to recycling programs, which will further escalate costs and add
to risks of being able to market the materials collected.
•

High recycling rates inadvertently justify high consumption rates. Statutory recycling targets
do not prevent waste, but force the focus on recycling.

•

Providing garbage collection more frequently than recycling collection encourages disposal
rather than recycling.

•

The development of integrated waste management facilities, such as commercial material
recovery facilities (MRFs) and biodegradable waste composting facilities are complex and
expensive, and siting such facilities is problematic if not impossible.

•

Flow control will become an issue if Iowa establishes waste rules and regulations that are
more stringent, onerous, and more costly than those of surrounding states.

•

The overriding goal should be on climate change; the potential of source reduction or
recycling to achieve the goal of reducing GHG emissions should be evaluated.

•

As the principal generator of waste, industry is a crucial stakeholder in the effective
implementation of waste reduction and recycling.

Implementation Mechanisms
•

Assist in the creation and expansion of sustainable markets to support diversion and
recycling efforts.

•

Introduce appropriate financial, legal, and policy incentives and sanctions to induce waste
generators to prevent waste and recycle.

•

Focus local government efforts to require multifamily recycling.

•

Focus local government efforts to require construction and demolition recycling.

•

Make recycling more convenient and cost-effective when compared to waste disposal, e.g.,
implement curbside single-stream recycling systems and food waste collection.

•

Implement incentives for customers to reduce waste through meaningful unit-based pricing
systems for waste disposal in all regions with large populations.

•

Establish composting programs for yard waste and food waste in all regions with combined
large populations.

•

Pilot commercial MRFs through which all commercial waste will be processed before
residuals are disposed of (not front-end).

•

Require mandatory life-cycle product stewardship (extended producer responsibility) that is
designed, financed, and managed by manufacturers of consumer goods.

•

Hold manufacturers responsible for the waste and environmental impacts of their products
and packaging (producer responsibility), rather than passing that responsibility on to the
consumer.

•

Place a tax on plastic bags.

•

Establish statewide landfill bans for select materials that can be reused, recycled, or
otherwise recovered.

•

Expand the materials collected through the Bottle Bill and increase financial incentives for
collectors.

•

Educate the community about the consequences of generating waste and responsible
consumerism.

•

Clearly define waste reduction and establish as a priority.

•

Distribute information on how to reduce unwanted mail and catalogs.

•

Encourage use of reusable shopping bags.

•

Promote “simple living” and local purchasing.

•

Promote an economic environment that favors the use of recycled materials.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Waste Management Programs: Iowa runs several programs to promote waste reduction,
recycling, and composting. These programs include IA DNR’s Solid Waste Alternatives

I-78

Program, Pollution Prevention Services Program, and Iowa Waste Exchange, as well as the Iowa
Waste Reduction Center at the University of Northern Iowa.
Landfill Diversion Goals: Iowa adopted the goal of diverting 50% of waste from landfills by
2000 from 1988 levels.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2: Upstream energy use reductions—The energy and GHG intensity of manufacturing a
product is generally less when using recycled feedstocks than when using virgin feedstocks.
CH4: Diverting biodegradable wastes from landfills will result in a decrease in methane gas
releases from landfills.
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2012, 2020 (MMtCO2e): 1.49 and 4.06, respectively.
Net Cost per tCO2e: –$8.
Data Sources: Data on current waste generation and recycling rates were taken from the IA
DNR 2007 report Economic Impacts of Recycling in Iowa.111 IA DNR reports the composting of
yard trimmings and food wastes as a part of the recycling stream in this report. GHG emission
reductions were modeled using EPA’s WAste Reduction Model (WARM).112
Quantification Methods:
The waste management profile in Iowa presented in the Policy Design section was used as a
baseline to project BAU and policy scenarios, which form the basis for this quantitative analysis.
The average annual increase in per capita waste generation is assumed to be 0.14% (Table I-8-2).
The share of waste management comprised of recycling and composting is assumed not to
change throughout the policy period. Therefore, the assumed recycling rate was 27.1%, and the
assumed composting rate was 2.1%.113 The population projection for Iowa through 2020 is

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. “WAste Reduction Model (WARM).” Version 8, May 2006. Available
at: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange//wycd/waste/calculators/WARM_home.html. EPA created WARM to help
solid waste planners and organizations track and voluntarily report GHG emission reductions from several different
waste management practices. WARM is available as a Web-based calculator and as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
WARM calculates and totals GHG emissions of baseline and alternative waste management practices—source
reduction, recycling, combustion, composting, and landfilling. The model calculates emissions in tons of carbon
equivalent (tCe), tCO2e, and energy units (MMBtu) across a wide range of material types commonly found in MSW.
For an explanation of the methodology, see the EPA report Solid Waste Management and Greenhouse Gases: A
Life-Cycle Assessment of Emissions and Sinks, EPA530-R-02-006, May 2002. Available at http://epa.gov/
climatechange/wycd/waste/SWMGHGreport.html.
113

All organic material that is “recycled” is considered to be “composted,” as a result of modeling constraints, As
recycling and composting have different implications in the analysis of the GHG benefits and cost-effectiveness of
this option, the two management methods are treated separately, with the total diversion equal to the target of 35%.
Please note that the term “diversion” refers to the combination of recycling and composting.

The policy scenario was determined by applying the Subcommittee targets to the BAU waste
management projection in Table I-8-3. Interim targets for 2012 were estimated, assuming that
recycling and composting each makes up a constant proportion of the goal. The 2012 targets for
recycling and composting are 35.5% and 3.5%, respectively. The 2020 targets for recycling and
composting are 45.0% and 5.0%, respectively. The waste reduction goal (5% decrease in waste
per capita by 2020) is applied by assuming a constant reduction in the difference between the
BAU projected annual increase in the generation per capita rate and the 2005 baseline generation
per capita rate. Table I-8-4 outlines the policy waste management scenario.

The WARM was run for the years 2012 and 2020 to produce GHG reduction estimates for the
policy target years. GHG benefits are assumed to increase linearly between policy initiation
(2010) and between modeled years. The proportional generation and recycling are assumed to
stay the same throughout the policy period. The exceptions, however, are those categories for
which source reduction is an acceptable input for the policy scenario. It is assumed that source
reduction offsets landfilled waste, with the amount of waste recycled generally increasing for
these categories. The breakdown of source reduction for each waste category is shown in Table
I-8-7.116 Tables I-8-8 and I-8-9 display the BAU and policy WARM modeling for 2020.

116

This breakdown is similar to the one used for the Minnesota CCS process, adjusted to prevent more tons from
being “source reduced” than would have been generated under BAU. Also, it is assumed that no more than 75% of
any given material may be source reduced.

Cost-Effectiveness
Source reduction—The amount of waste managed in Iowa under the policy scenario is reduced,
due to the goal requiring a zero percent increase in the per capita waste generation rate by 2020.
The cost-effectiveness estimate for source reduction in Iowa comprises three elements: the cost
of program implementation, the avoided costs of waste collection and disposal.
The cost of program implementation is assumed to be $1.00 per capita per year.117 The cost figure
uses a population projection consistent with that used for the Iowa I&F. These funds are assumed
to cover any education and marketing programs necessary to implement the source reduction goal.
Source reduction is expected to save money by reducing the amount of waste that has to be
collected and disposed of in landfills. The avoided collection cost is $80/ton,118 and the avoided
landfill disposal fee is $40/ton.119
The analysis assumes that costs begin to be incurred in 2010. The estimated cost savings result in
an NPV of –$112 million. Cumulative GHG reductions attributed to recycling are 10.3
MMtCO2e, and the estimated cost-effectiveness is –$11/tCO2e, as shown in Table I-8-11.

Recycling—The net cost of increased recycling rates in Iowa was estimated by adding the
increased costs of collection for two-stream recycling, revenue obtained for the value of recycled
materials, and avoided landfill tipping fees. The additional cost for separate curbside collection
of recyclables is $133/ton.120 The capital cost of additional recycling facilities in Iowa is
$148 million.121 Annualized over the 10-year policy period at 5% interest, the capital cost is
$9.6 million/year. The avoided cost for landfill tipping is $40/ton, plus a $10 tip fee paid to the
hauler.122 CCS also factored in the commodity value of recycled materials with a value of
$156/ton.123 Table I-8-12 provides the results of the cost analysis. The analysis assumes that
costs begin to be incurred in 2010. The estimated cost savings result in an NPV of –$188 million.
Cumulative GHG reductions attributed to recycling are 16 MMtCO2e, and the estimated costeffectiveness is –$12/tCO2e.
Composting—Composting is included in the total recycling volume in the Economic Impacts of
Recycling in Iowa: Final Report. However, as WARM considers the sole form of diversion for
yard trimmings and food waste to be composting, the tons of these items that are “recycled” are
assumed to be composted. The net costs for increased composting in Iowa were estimated by
adding the additional costs for collection (same calculation as recycling) and the net cost for
composting operations. The net cost for composting operations is the sum of the annualized
capital and operating costs of composting, increased collection fees, revenue generated through
the sale of compost, and the avoided tipping fees for landfilling. Information on the capital and
operating costs of composting facilities was received from Cassella Waste Management during
the analysis of a similar option in Vermont.124 These data are summarized in Table I-8-13.

CCS assumed that the composting facilities to be built within the policy period would tend to be
from the largest category (a capital cost of $8 million, and an O&M cost of $30/ton) shown in
Table I-8-13. The composting volumes in 2012 and 2020 shown in Table I-8-14 suggest the need
for three additional large composting operations by 2020. To annualize the capital costs of these
facilities, CCS assumed a 15-year operating life and a 5% interest rate. Other cost assumptions
include an assumed landfill tipping fee of $40/ton,125 an additional source-separated organics
collection fee of $113/ton (as used above in the recycling element), a compost facility tipping fee
of $15/ton,126 and a compost value of $11.75/ton.127

Key Assumptions:
For the MSW management input data to WARM, the key assumption is that none of the goals
would be achieved via existing programs in place. To the extent that those programs will fully or
partly achieve the goals of this policy, the GHG reductions estimated would be lower (no
additional penetration from the current Iowa recycling and composting campaigns has been
incorporated into the BAU assumptions for this analysis). Therefore, the most important
assumption relates to the assumed BAU projection for solid waste management. This BAU
forecast is based on current practices and does not factor in the effects of further gains in
recycling or composting rates during the policy period. The BAU assumptions are needed to tie
into the assumptions used to develop the GHG forecast for the waste management sector, which
does not factor in these changes in waste management practices during the policy period (2008–
2020). To the extent that these gains in recycling and composting would occur without this
policy, the benefits and costs are overstated.
The other key assumptions relate to the use of WARM in estimating life-cycle GHG benefits and
the use of the stated assumptions regarding costs for increased source reduction, recycling, and
organics recovery (composting in this example) programs.
Another important assumption is that under BAU, the waste directed to landfilling would include
methane recovery (75% collection efficiency) and utilization. The need for this assumption is
partly based on limitations of WARM (which doesn’t allow for management of landfilled waste
into controlled and uncontrolled landfills), but is also based on the overall direction of the policy
options of AFW-8.

I-90

Additionally, transportation emissions for WARM are taken as default. This analysis has not
considered the impacts of reduced exports as a result of the goals in this option’s Policy Design
section.
The cost estimates do not include cost savings that would be achieved by avoiding the need for
additional waste-to-energy (WTE) plants.
Key Uncertainties
A large portion of the benefits yielded by the goals set forth in this option are derived from the
indirect, life-cycle emission reductions that result from recycling and source reduction. The
change in direct landfill emissions as a result of full implementation of the goals in this option
would be an increase of 39,097 tCO2e in 2012 and a reduction of 69,451 tCO2e in 2020. The
GHG benefits from reduced transportation resulting from a decrease in generation would be
211 tCO2e in 2012 and 711 tCO2e in 2020.128

AFW-9. Landfill Methane Energy Programs

Policy Description
Use the renewable energy within landfill gas (LFG) (methane) to make electric power, space
heat, or liquefied natural gas. Methane gas generation by landfills is a GHG reduction strategy
that may benefit from a cap-and-trade system, encouraging landfills to install flares at a
minimum and possibly achieve electric generation if the economic incentives are sufficient.
Policy Design
Goals:
• Control—Increase the number of landfills that recover methane as an energy source wherever
it is economically feasible to do so. By 2020, ensure that all large landfills are fully
controlling the release of methane, such that 50% of the LFG being generated is controlled
by 2020. This can be done through development of additional landfill-gas-to-energy
(LFGTE) projects. For sites where LFGTE is not feasible, implement flaring controls to
achieve the goal.
•

Technology research and evaluation—Since conversion technologies hold promise for
environmentally managing waste and producing energy, annually examine the experience
and costs of emerging technologies for waste management with the goal of determining the
feasibility of the technology for Iowa [nonquantified goal].

•

Education—Begin to educate the public about the impact and costs of various WTE
technologies [nonquantified goal].

Timing: Fully implement policies to achieve the above goals by 2020.
Parties Involved: Municipal and county governments, private solid waste management
companies, local economic development agencies, IA DNR, nongovernmental organizations, and
public interest groups.
Other:
Iowa currently has 4 landfill operations that are recovering methane (2 generate electricity).
EPA’s Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) identifies 17 facilities that may have the
opportunity to recover methane. These landfills have the potential to capture an additional 35%
of methane beyond the baseline methane capture of 40%.
Methane Energy Programs
• The capture of one ton of methane from LFG is equivalent to reducing approximately
20 tCO2e. (Benefits of LFG energy and LMOP are available at: www.epa.gov/lmop/
benefits.htm.)

I-92

•

According to LMOP landfills generate about 22.6% of methane emissions in the United
States. Methane is the second most important GHG.129

•

If landfilling of organic materials is to be continued, future landfills must be fully controlled
bioreactors where most of the methane generated is captured and used to produce energy.130

•

Actual emissions of methane from landfills are sensitive to dozens of site-specific factors and
can vary over a wide range, but CCS does not have either the direct measurement data or the
detailed site data that would be required to conduct more than an approximate estimate of
methane emissions from Iowa landfills (from a North Carolina study).

Waste-to-Energy Mass Burn
• Incineration, the combustion of organic material, such as waste, with energy recovery is the
most common WTE implementation.
•

Other than removing oversized items and household hazardous waste, little preprocessing is
necessary.

•

Depending on the plant's location, size, and other factors, the capital costs range from
$110,000 to $140,000 per daily ton of capacity. Therefore, a plant that processes 1,000 tons
of MSW per day may cost $110–$140 million. In addition to the capital costs, a 1,000-tonper-day plant would engage about 60 personnel. Other costs are services, materials and
supplies, and the cost of disposal of ash.131

•

Tipping fees at WTE plants, based on 15 respondents, ranged from $40/ton in North Carolina
(one facility) to $98/ton (3 facilities).132

•

Experts and local community groups are concerned with modern incinerators because of fine
particulate emissions, metal, trace dioxins and acid gas emissions, toxic fly ash, and bottom
ash management, as well as waste resource ethics, such as the destruction of valuable
resources and low energy efficiency.

•

Incineration or combustion in any form is rejected in the zero-waste movement as a viable,
sustainable, or ethical solution to waste management. Lack of public acceptability remains a
barrier to emerging waste management technologies.

Emerging Technologies for MSW (Gasification, Plasma Arc, Thermal Depolymerization,
Ethanol Production From Waste, and Anaerobic Digestion)
• Currently, long-term experience with alternative technologies is unavailable. Waste
conversion technologies have very high costs, and the vast majority have not been proven on

a commercial scale or as full-scale plants using MSW. More than 90% of these technologies
are still in the experimental, development, small-scale, or pilot project stage—i.e., they are
not mature technologies. Experts agree that they are not currently a reliable, cost-effective
alternative.
•

Only gasification and plasma arc can handle the entire MSW waste stream with limited
residuals. Most other processes require preprocessing or pretreatment by separating out
incompatible and recyclable materials, homogenizing, and shredding. This means that
materials must either be separated at the source or processed through an MRF.

•

Some processes produce an ash containing constituents of lead, cadmium, and mercury that
need to be managed in an environmentally responsible manner.

•

Proponents for conversion technologies report that they produce not only energy but also
usable products and by-products, such as slag. The slag bonds metals, halogen, and sulfur
atoms with silicate to make leaching of the materials difficult. The profitability of products
and by-products depends on viable markets and the value of the products produced. There are
risks with constructing such facilities with a goal of profiting from products and by-products.

Implementation Mechanisms
Incentives could be provided to industries that relocate close their operations close enough to
existing landfill sites to use the methane and electricity generated from those facilities.
Cost incentives, such as carbon credits, could make methane capture and utilization more
attractive.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Methane Gas Conversion Property Tax Exemption: Under Iowa’s Methane Gas Conversion
Property Tax Exemption, property used for methane gas collection and conversion into energy
and connected with or in conjunction with a publicly owned sanitary landfill is exempt from
property tax. If other fuels are burned as well, the exemption is equal to the ratio of methane in
the overall fuel mix.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
CO2, N2O, CH4: Displaces emissions from fossil fuel combustion.
I-94

CH4: Methane reductions via collection and control (via flaring, or preferentially via energy
utilization).
Estimated GHG Reductions and Net Costs or Cost Savings
GHG Reduction Potential in 2012, 2020 (MMtCO2e): 0.2, 0.8, respectively.
Net Cost per tCO2e: $0.9.
Data Sources: Data on current landfill operations using methane recovery for energy generation
(direct or electric) are taken from the EPA LMOP Web site.133 Baseline LFG emissions are
consistent with the Iowa I&F.134 CCS used the results of LFGTE cost modeling performed with
EPA’s LFGcost model to estimate the costs for this policy element.135
Quantification Methods:
GHG Benefits
Since the goal stated in the above Policy Design section requires control of methane emissions
specifically from uncontrolled landfills, CCS used the emission estimates for uncontrolled
landfills from the I&F as the baseline emission scenario. In 2005, 20.5% of methane emissions in
Iowa were controlled through an LFGTE project, according to the Iowa I&F. Therefore, the
incremental methane emission recovery goal in Iowa will be 29.5% in 2020.
As emissions from uncontrolled landfills are controlled, three GHG benefits are realized: (1) the
conversion of landfill methane to CO2, (2) the displacement of grid-based electricity, and (3) the
displacement of fossil fuel combusted for direct heat.136 The first benefit is calculated by
multiplying the baseline methane emissions from uncontrolled landfills from the Iowa I&F by
the LFG control goal specified in the Policy Design section. The second benefit (offset
electricity) is found by converting the methane captured from tCO2e units to cubic meters of gas.
and then calculating the electricity generated and the emissions offset through avoided gridbased generation. The third GHG benefit is calculated by multiplying the fraction of captured
LFG combusted for direct use by the quantity of LFG captured under this policy option,
assuming that an equal amount of natural gas is not combusted for direct heat use. The estimated
GHG benefits in 2012 and 2020 are 0.2 and 0.8 MMtCO2e, respectively. The cumulative GHG
benefit through 2020 is estimated to be 4.8 MMtCO2e. Table I-9-1 depicts the results of these
calculations.

Cost-Effectiveness
Using the results from an LFGcost model run, the costs of this option are estimated (Table I-9-2)
based on whether the methane is converted to usable energy by a small engine, through direct
use, or a large engine (800 kilowatts and greater).137 To develop an overall cost for this policy
option, CCS used the following assumptions on the mix of projects that would be implemented
to achieve the policy’s goals: 17% of methane is reduced via standard engine/generator set
projects (it was assumed that these projects already have implemented gas collection, which is
therefore not a part of the capital cost); 20% of methane is controlled by direct-use projects (the
number of projects is assumed to be limited by the location of end users); and the remaining 63%
is assumed to be controlled by small-engine/generator-set projects.138

Note: Assumes 8% interest rate over 10 years, 15-year project life, and cost of LFG collection and flaring included in

The modeling assumptions were based on the average opening and closing year of landfills in
Iowa (1997 and 2029, respectively), average annual acceptance for large landfills (114,090 tons),
and average annual acceptance for small landfills (36,334 tons). It was assumed that large
landfills will use large engines, and small landfills will use either small engines or direct heat
technology. The average depth of the landfills was assumed to be 50 feet (LFGcost Default). The
assumed number of wells for small landfills was 17, and the number of wells for large landfills
was 62.139 The default values for the revenue from energy sold were used ($0.045/kWh,
$4.50/MMBtu).
The average cost-effectiveness ($1.32/tCO2e) is multiplied by the GHG benefit calculated in the
GHG Benefit section for each year to determine the cost-effectiveness of this policy option
(Table I-9-3). The NPV of costs incurred through the implementation of this option is $4.3
million, and the discounted cost-effectiveness is $0.9/tCO2e (assumes no escalation of costs
during the policy period).

Key Assumptions:
The analysis does not factor in the closure of specific landfills or the adoption of LFG controls at
specific landfills. Modeling GHG emissions and reductions at individual sites is beyond the
scope of this analysis. However, the approach used is consistent with the methods used to
develop the GHG forecast for the waste management sector.
Each of the cost inputs above contains key assumptions; additional study of these inputs could
reduce the associated uncertainty in the cost estimates.
Key Uncertainties
As stated above, the GHG reduction potential of this option comprises direct and indirect
benefits. The direct benefits of the goal are estimated to reduce GHG emissions by 0.2 tCO2e in
2012 and 0.6 tCO2e in 2020, for a cumulative reduction of 3.8 tCO2e. The indirect GHG benefits
related to this option are the offset energy use from electricity and natural gas (in the case of
direct use LFGTE). These indirect benefits are estimated to total 0.01 tCO2e in 2012, and 0.14
tCO2e in 2020, for a cumulative indirect benefit of 1.0 tCO2e.
A key source of uncertainty related to cost-effectiveness is the price of energy that may produce
a source of revenue for LFGTE projects. For the above analysis, the default assumptions of
$0.045/kWh of electricity and $4.50/MMBtu of natural gas were used. Note that these figures
will not necessarily be the retail price of energy, but the actual price that an MSW facility would
be paid by the utility for the additional energy. Thus, this price is likely lower than the retail
energy prices. The electricity purchase prices that would be needed for the electricity projects

I-98

(projected to incur a net cost over time by the LFGcost model under the default energy prices)
are $0.067/kWh for large facilities (over 800 kW rated capacity) and $0.097 for small facilities.
In 2008, severe flooding in Iowa greatly increased pressure on the state’s landfill system.
According to Subcommittee experts, previously closed sites, such as the Linn County Bluestem
Landfill Site #1, have recently received large amounts of waste. Because this influx of solid
waste will most likely affect the future quantity of LFG generated at these landfills, the GHG
benefits yielded by this policy option may increase, although the effect on cost-effectiveness is
unknown.
Additional Benefits and Costs
None identified.
Feasibility Issues
There is a danger of overcommitting on infrastructure to recover value.
Discussions during meetings of the AFW Subcommittee yielded concern about whether Iowa
would be able to meet the goal of 50% LFG control by 2020, given the current waste disposal
patterns. Table I-9-4 displays the 2007 disposal schedule for the landfills identified by EPA as
Operational, Candidate, or Potential LFGTE projects.140

CC-1. GHG Inventories, Forecasting, Reporting, and Registry

Policy Description
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories and forecasts are essential for understanding the
magnitude of all emission sources and sinks (both man made [anthropogenic] and natural), the
relative contribution of various types of emission sources and sinks to total emissions, and the
factors that affect trends over time. Inventories and forecasts help to inform state leaders and the
public on statewide trends and mitigation opportunities, and in verifying GHG reductions
associated with implementation of action plan initiatives.
GHG reporting supports tracking and management of emissions. It can help sources identify
emission reduction opportunities, reduce risks associated with possible future GHG mandates
through early participation, and construct periodic state GHG inventories. GHG reporting is a
precursor for sources to participate in GHG reduction programs, and/or a GHG emission registry,
as well as to secure “baseline protection” (i.e., credit for early reductions).
A GHG registry enables recording of GHG emissions in a central repository with “transaction
ledger” capacity to support tracking, reductions management, and “ownership” of documented
emission reductions; it offers recognition opportunities; and/or provides a mechanism for
regional, multi-state, and cross-border cooperation. Properly designed registry structures also
provide a foundation for possible future trading programs.
Policy Design
The Iowa Climate Change Advisory Council (ICCAC) presents the option that the state institute
a formal GHG inventory and forecast function within the Iowa Department of Natural Resources
(IDNR) and in conjunction with the Iowa Office of Energy Independence (OEI), to be assisted
by other state agencies as needed. IDNR should play a central role in the development and
maintenance of the GHG inventory, forecast, reporting, and registry functions because the
mission of OEI focuses the agency on both energy and GHG emission reductions. Construction
of GHG expertise within OEI will assist the agency in developing energy and GHG emission
reduction strategies as it administers its programs.
The ICCAC notes that Iowa has joined the effort to develop a national GHG registry through The
Climate Registry. Being a charter state in this effort should help ensure that Iowa’s needs and
priorities are addressed in the course of The Climate Registry’s development. To the extent that
Iowa’s needs may not be fully met by The Climate Registry, Iowa should consider developing
supplemental or ancillary registry capacities.
Key elements of program design include:
Inventory and Forecasting
• The statewide inventory and forecasting function must include all anthropogenic emission
sources and sinks within the state.

•

Appendix J – CCI, 12-15 -08

As much as possible, the forecasting function should incorporate current and projected GHG
emission trends based on business as usual, with additional scenarios that incorporate
modified trends based on projected impacts of climate change.

Reporting and Registry
• The state should require mandatory reporting of GHG emissions by public and private
organizations having net GHG emissions exceeding de minimis levels. De minimis levels
should be set at levels that maintain consistency with existing and developing regional and
national programs. By making reporting mandatory, Iowa businesses will gain advantage
over competitors in non-reporting states through growing recognition of GHG emission
sources and potential solutions.
•

Optional reporting, or opt-ins, should be allowed for sources with GHG emissions below de
minimis levels.

•

Provision should be made for optional reporting of carbon sinks, including processes for
aggregation and reporting of small-quantity sinks.

•

Reporting should use the scoping approaches developed by the World Resources Institute in
the GHG Protocol for segregation of direct and indirect emissions and to maintain the ability
to denote ownership of emissions and emission reductions for potential crediting processes.
(See: http://www.ghgprotocol.org/standards )

•

Certification criteria for registry acceptance should be developed in accordance with existing
and developing regional and national programs.

•

Reporting should occur annually on a calendar-year basis for all six traditional GHGs as
recognized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

•

Every effort should be made to maximize consistency with federal, regional, and other states’
GHG reporting programs.

•

GHG emissions reports should be verified through self-certification and agency spot checks;
to qualify for future registry purposes, reports should undergo third-party verification.

•

Project-based emissions reporting should be allowed, when properly identified as such and
when quantified with equally rigorous consistency.

•

The reporting program should provide for appropriate public transparency of reported
emissions.

•

The reporting program should provide safeguards to allow baseline protection for sources.

Goals:
• Develop an inventory and forecasting capacity for statewide, anthropogenic emission sources
and sinks.
•

Develop a consistent protocol for use in preparing the statewide emission and sink inventory
and forecasts.

•

Develop a consistent protocol for use in implementing reporting requirements.

•

Develop a periodic, consistent, and complete forecast of future GHG emissions in at least 5and 10-year increments extending at least 20 years into the future.

•

Annually provide a statewide GHG emissions inventory and forecast, as required by Iowa
Code 455B.152(2a).

•

Biennially provide a summary of progress toward meeting the ICCAC GHG emission
reduction scenarios.

•

Develop a mandatory GHG emission reporting program for sources with GHG emissions
exceeding the de minimis threshold.

•

Adopt established protocols and software to record and properly document GHG emissions
and emission reductions for Iowa sources and sinks.

Timing: This function should be implemented as soon as possible when resources become
available.
Parties Involved: IDNR, OEI, other state agencies as appropriate, all anthropogenic GHG
emission sources and sinks.
Other: Not applicable.
Implementation Mechanisms
Inventory: The state has already embarked on a very limited process to update the top-down
statewide emission inventory. A much more robust inventory capacity is needed and will be
developed, subject to available resources.
Forecasting: Forecasting will become a vital component of the ICCAC decision-making
process. As such, provision should be made in ICCAC’s mission to work with IDNR to facilitate
the update of the forecasts on a biennial basis through ICCAC, subject to available resources.
The forecasting should include adjustments for predicted changes in the Iowa economy, brought
about in reaction to future climatic changes.
Registry and Reporting: Legislation may be required to institute a mandatory reporting
requirement for entities with annual GHG emissions exceeding a de minimis threshold. The
program should also lay out requirements for entity (facility/source) definition, offset* definition,
emission quantification and verification requirements, emission reduction documentation
requirements, opt-in provisions for small sources, and an aggregation function for small offset
providers.
The above initiatives are not currently adequately funded, so will need additional resources to
implement.

*

An offset is a verifiable reduction in GHGs. Offsets can be bought and sold and can be used to achieve
compliance with GHG limits.

CC-2. Statewide GHG Reduction Scenarios

Policy Description
To date, Iowa has not adopted any mandatory statewide GHG reduction goals. Iowa Code
Reference 455B.152(3)(a) and (b) and 455B.152(4), which the Iowa legislature passed in 2007,
requires the IDNR to establish a GHG inventory and a voluntary GHG gas registry for tracking,
managing, and crediting entities in the state that reduce their generation of GHGs. Under the
same legislation, the ICCAC is required to recommend a baseline year from which to calculate
future GHG reductions, and to develop multiple scenarios to reduce GHG emissions in Iowa by
2050, including interim years with targeted goals. A 50% reduction scenario by 2050 was
specified in the legislation, and the ICCAC in its January 1, 2008, interim report recommended
an additional scenario of 90% reduction by 2050, with subsequent scenarios to be determined for
interim years of 2012 and 2020. The baseline year for Iowa is recommended in the Interim
Report to be 2005.
Governor Culver issued the Green Government Executive Order (Executive Order 06) on
February 21, 2008, which sets the goal of reducing “the use of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil
and water in all state office buildings by at least 15% overall in the next 5 years, taking into
account growth in the state workforce and/or changes in building operations.” This follows
Governor Vilsack’s Executive Order 41 to reduce electricity and natural gas by 15% by 2010
from the year 2000 baseline. These executive orders are establishing policy goals of greater than
1.5% per year reductions in the use of fossil fuels for state building operations in the near term,
and presumably they will result in similar GHG reductions for state buildings if fully
implemented.
Legislation in 2007 also produced the Iowa OEI and the Iowa Plan for Energy Independence.
The plan “shall provide cost effective options and strategies for reducing the state’s consumption
of energy, dependence on foreign sources of energy, use of fossil fuels, and GHG emissions. The
options and strategies developed in the plan shall provide for achieving energy independence
from foreign sources of energy by the year 2025.” In addition, the Midwestern Governors
Association adopted the Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Platform for the Midwest,
which specifies an energy efficiency goal of at least 2% per year reduction in natural gas and
electricity use to be achieved by 2015.
Transitioning from the fossil fuel age to a new mix of energy sources like energy conservation,
efficiency, cellulosic biofuels, and wind power is already creating “green collar” jobs and
invigorating the economy in Iowa. Early action alternatives have much greater effect in
mitigating future climate change and its impacts compared to later reductions. Reductions for
developed countries in the range of 25%–40% by 2020 and 80%–95% by 2050 were discussed in
the initial Bali round of the Framework Convention on Climate Change in December 2007. It is
recognized that “substantial deviation from baseline” will also be necessary for developing
economies in Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia, and centrally planned Asia.

Policy Design
During 2008, the ICCAC has evaluated the catalog of preferred options in terms of their potential
to reduce GHG emissions in Iowa and their relative cost effectiveness. Following the
construction of the baseline for Iowa emissions, the ICCAC has estimated the opportunities
available and reductions considered most effective for the state to implement. The final report
will be forwarded to the General Assembly of Iowa and to Governor Culver by December 31,
2008.
Additionally, a performance tracking mechanism should be established to measure progress over
time in achieving the established GHG reduction goals.
Goals: Development of two scenarios by the ICCAC:
•

Target GHG reductions of 1% below 2005 levels by 2012 and 11% below 2005 levels by
2020, culminating in a statewide GHG emission reduction of 50% below 2005 levels by 2050
from the 2005 baseline;

•

Target GHG Reductions of 3% below 2005 levels by 2012 and 22% below 2005 levels by
2020, culminating in a statewide GHG emission reduction of 90% below 2005 levels by 2050
from the 2005 baseline.

Timing: Early action will be necessary to meet the scenarios for 2012 and 2020.
Parties Involved: The ICCAC will report to the General Assembly and Governor Culver.
Initiation of legislation and/or executive action will be necessary for some specific alternatives. It
is anticipated that Iowa business and industry, Regents Universities, community colleges, and
numerous NGOs will also be involved in implementation.
Other: None.
Implementation Mechanisms
It is anticipated that if the preferred options are fully implemented, it would set the state on the
course of the 90% reduction goal by 2050. The ICCAC should divide the policy options into
groups requiring action by the Governor’s Office (through Executive Order), the General
Assembly (through state legislation), other state government entities (e.g., the OEI), and
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). During 2009, ICCAC members may be involved with
further design and development of these policy options and related implementation strategies.
Legislative and/or executive action will be needed for short-, mid- and long-term scenarios that
are elements of the options proposed by the ICCAC. There is a need to develop a strategic
system of incentives and disincentives. This should include provisions to establish appropriate
enforceability provisions where needed.

CC-3. State and Local Government GHG Emissions (Lead by Example)

Policy Description
State of Iowa property belongs to all Iowans, and its expansion and upkeep is funded by Iowans’
tax dollars. The same is true for each Iowan’s public school and city or county government. The
majority of Iowans believe strong action is required to reduce GHG emissions. Government
buildings, office equipment, and vehicles are present in every Iowa community and are among
the biggest energy consumers in the state. As such, they represent a very significant opportunity
for changing the course of Iowa’s energy use.
State and local governments should be at the forefront of energy efficiency and renewable
energy. By installing the most efficient technology and tapping local power sources,
governments can reduce their own GHG emissions, create a significant opportunity for
businesses to create and install efficient and/or renewable technologies, create a tested pool of
Iowa-specific best practices, build communities’ sense of pride in their governments (perhaps
boosted by tax decreases and economic benefit), and spur residents and businesses to pursue
energy efficiency and renewable energy.
Policy Design
Goals: Iowa is already considered a leader in energy efficiency and renewable energy. However,
given the substantial costs and benefits, state and local governments must take further action.
The Governor should consider instituting a “Governors Challenge” to the state agencies and the
people of Iowa. Under the challenge, each state agency should produce an annual GHG budget.
In addition to the assessing its own GHG emissions, Iowa should assist cities and counties in
completing similar assessments so community governments do not waste their limited resources.
State and local governments should take immediate actions to reduce their energy use and
increase efficiency. For example, all existing buildings should be assessed for upgrades, and all
cost-effective measures should be implemented; and all existing vehicles should be properly
maintained so they perform at their highest capacity.
State and local governments should consider efficient possibilities in all procurements, for
example:
•

All new buildings and renovations should meet sustainable design or development standards,
as will be developed in the State Building Code Update.

•

Newly purchased vehicles should have the highest practical fuel and GHG efficiency.

•

All new office equipment and appliances should be ENERGY STAR-certified where applicable.

State and local governments (with technical assistance from the state) should assess the
renewable energy resources in their vicinities to see if they are economically feasible for
development. Twenty percent of state and local governments’ electricity should come from

renewable sources by 2020, either from their own production or purchased from their energy
company.
The state should hold an annual contest to have Iowans submit ideas for how state government
could exceed its GHG emission reduction scenarios. For example, testing an idea, such as a
carbon-neutral legislative session, would reduce GHG emissions, draw attention to the state’s
other energy efforts, and create excitement about reducing emissions.
The ICCAC should hold workshops for state employees on various themes for lowering their
carbon footprints; this could be done in collaboration with the actions described in policy option
CC-4 (Public Education and Outreach).
Timing: Various, depending on the initiative, but starting as soon as possible.
Parties Involved: All levels of government operating in Iowa.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Legislative and/or executive action will be needed for short-, mid- and long-term Scenarios
developed by the ICCAC, and/or other elements of the CAP.

•

Review of agencies’ and communities’ GHG budgets, recognition of leaders, and
accountability for progress in reducing GHG emissions.

•

Implementation of all cost-effective energy efficiency measures.

•

Procurement of low-GHG products.

•

Assessment of renewable energy potential followed by implementation.

•

An annual contest sponsored by the state for Iowans to submit ideas for how state
government could go above and beyond current scenarios in reducing its GHG emissions.
For example, testing an idea, such as a carbon-neutral legislative session, would reduce GHG
emissions, draw attention to the state’s other energy efforts, and create excitement about
reducing emissions.

•

ICCAC workshops for state employees on various themes for lowering their carbon
footprints.

•

Using the rulemaking process of the State Building Commissioner to update the State
Building Code with sustainable design and development standards.

•

Use of state employee incentives and disincentives.

•

Legislative implementation (tax credits, taxes, subsidies, command-and-control legislation),
executive action, cap-and-trade markets, and voluntary measures are all anticipated.

Related Policies/Programs in Place

The Energy Excellent Buildings Task Force will focus on “greening” new and existing state
office buildings and facilities, including leased space. The goal of the task force will be to reduce
the use of electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and water in all state office buildings by at least 15%
overall in the next 5 years, taking into account growth in the state work force or changes in
building operations.
The goal of the Sustainable Materials Task Force will be to promote resource efficiency.
The state will be assigning an energy manager within each agency.
The Biofuels Task Force will focus on at least three issue areas: increasing the use of biofuels by
state agencies to the maximum amount feasible, reducing the number of vehicle miles traveled
by state employees, and increasing the fuel efficiency of the state vehicle fleet.
In addition, the order requires a thorough review and audit of executive branch agencies’ current
practices related to energy efficiency and conservation. Using the audit data, the steering
committee will develop a Master Plan on how to “green” state government, and track progress
of state agencies.
Several Iowa communities’ mayors have signed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate
Protection Agreement. Under the Agreement, participating cities commit to take following three
actions:
•

Strive to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol scenarios in their own communities, through
actions ranging from anti-sprawl land-use policies, to urban forest restoration projects, to
public information campaigns;

•

Urge their state governments, and the federal government, to enact policies and programs to
meet or beat the greenhouse gas emission reduction target suggested for the United States in
the Kyoto Protocol—7% reduction from 1990 levels by 2012; and

•

Urge the U.S. Congress to pass bipartisan greenhouse gas reduction legislation, which would
establish a national emission trading system.”

The mayors have signed on in the following Iowa communities: Altoona, Ames, Audubon,
Aurelia, Bellevue, Carlisle, Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids, Charles City, Clive, Coralville, Crystal
Lake, Davenport, Decorah, Des Moines, Dubuque, Fairbank, Fairfield, Grafton, Hiawatha, Iowa

CC-4. Public Education and Outreach

Policy Description
The goal of climate change education extends well beyond the goal of conventional education,
because it seeks not only to impart cognitive knowledge, but also to translate knowledge into
positive action. Failure to appreciate this distinction has led to stagnation and lack of successful
approaches in creating a public that is literate about issues relevant to climate change. According
to the seminal work of Hungerford and Volk (1990),1 there are three levels of environmental
awareness:
•

Simple Awareness—Knowing about the existence and importance of an environmental issue,
but being unfamiliar with its complexities and having little relationship to personal change or
action.

•

Personal Conduct Knowledge—Understanding an environmental issue that lends itself to
changes in personal conduct, but does not require detailed comprehension.

•

Environmental Literacy—The outcome of a sound program of environmental education in
which the learner progresses to deeper knowledge, and can apply it to address complex
environmental issues and make wiser decisions.

Public education and outreach programs should address the public’s responsibility to maintain
clean air, pure water, and fertile soil for their children and future generations. Adding to the
challenge is that environmental information absorbed by the public stems from a diverse and
unconnected smattering of sources that includes television, radio, print media, environmental
groups, government publications, the Internet, the classroom, personal readings, chatting with
friends, and other experiences. In general there is no quality control for the information. In the
end, those seeking to learn about environmental issues are often left with little more than a
collection of factoids, numerous and often conflicting opinions, and very little understanding—
not enough to get beyond the “simple awareness” level cited above. Undoubtedly, excellent
resources are available for public environmental education, but they may be lost in the
background noise emanating from the cacophony of messages from disparate other sources.
There is not much detailed information about the level of climate change awareness in Iowa. The
available evidence, however, suggests that it may not extend much past “simple awareness,”
because there doesn’t appear to be significant change in personal conduct with respect to steps
that would mitigate climate change. For example, optimizing energy efficiency is a major
strategy for reducing GHG emissions, but a recent comprehensive study commissioned by the
Iowa Utility Association shows enormous untapped potential in realizing that goal for Iowa.

There is an urgent need for a comprehensive, objective, and authoritative climate change
education campaign for Iowa that will improve the knowledge base and motivate individuals,
communities, and organizations to take action to will reduce their GHG emissions.
Policy Design
Goals: The goal of the proposed education campaign will be to move Iowans beyond “simple
awareness” about climate change to “personal conduct knowledge.” Progressing to “climate
change literacy,” the highest level of awareness, is a loftier goal, certainly worthy of
achievement, but beyond the scope of the work proposed here. Even the more modest goal of
achieving “personal conduct knowledge” is very ambitious, and will require a multi-year
stepwise approach.
To achieve this goal, the state should consider forming a consortium on Climate Change
Education & Empowering Citizens Through Positive Actions. The consortium would be led by
the three Regents Universities, but would also involve private colleges, community colleges, and
numerous other Iowa organizations involved in education, outreach, and concern about climate
change and future generations.
The ICCAC has identified six target audiences for the education campaign: state government,
policy makers, industrial and economic sectors, future generations, community leaders and
community-based organizations, and the general public. State government is being addressed in
large part under CC-3 (State and Local Government GHG Emissions [Lead by Example]). The
consortium will assist this effort in the first year by hosting workshops on energy efficiency and
renewable energy for state workers. Similarly, the consortium will address the needs of policy
makers through a series of seminars and workshops to educate and promote conversations about
climate change and effective solutions. With regard to an education plan for targeted industrial
and economic sectors, the consortium will seek collaboration with the utilities and the Market
Advisory Group established under CC-5 (Cap-and-Tax Policies [transferred to Clean and
Renewable Energy Subcommittee]). The task of educating future generations will require
comprehensive discussion with the Iowa Department of Education to assess the feasibility and
promote the inclusion of integrating climate change into educational curricula and postsecondary degree programs.
The goal of educating community leaders, community-based organizations, and the general
public across Iowa requires a far more extensive approach that the consortium proposes to
achieve in a three-step plan. At the moment there is very little detailed information about what
Iowans know and don’t know about climate change, or about their willingness to take significant
steps to reduce its impacts. Telephone surveys are somewhat useful, but there is often a large
disparity between what people say on the phone and what they actually know and do in real life.
A far better means to weigh public attitudes is to engage the public in face-to-face dialogue in a
town meeting format. The consortium will address this need in Step 1. The subsequent steps in
the education campaign will be guided by the findings determined in step 1.

Appendix J – CCI, 12-15 -08

Step 1: Baseline Information: Analysis of Educational Needs and Preference for Positive
Actions (Year 1)
In this step the Iowa State University (ISU) Extension Service will engage numerous Iowa
communities in conversations about climate change. This will guarantee broad coverage, since
the ISU Extension serves every county in the state. We propose to adopt the approach the ISU
Extension applied to promote public dialogue on the issue of the bioeconomy (The Bioeconomy
in Iowa: Local Conversations, 2007), which covered 92 counties with an audience of more than
950 Iowans.
The county meetings on climate change will have two goals.
•

To gain a multifaceted perspective on the attitudes Iowans have about climate change, the
degree to which they agree or disagree with the science, factors that influence their opinions,
whether they perceive climate change as a threat to future generations, what aspects they
wish to learn more about, and a host of other issues.

•

To present a large menu of possible individual and community-based actions to mitigate
climate change, and to glean from the participants the actions they are most willing to
undertake.

As recommended by the ICCAC, special attention will be given to low-income communities.
The information gathered at the county meetings will provide grist for a climate change
education plan tailor-made for Iowans. One tangible outcome of the analysis will be a white
paper on “Climate Change Education and Seeking Solutions Through Positive Actions,” which
will provide the knowledge base for conducting Step 2.
Each participant at the county meetings will be asked to complete a survey prior to the meeting
to gauge their knowledge about climate change and actions that could mitigate climate change.
This survey will provide baseline data for evaluating the project.
Step 2: Enact Education Campaign (Year 2)
This step would promote multiple forums for educating Iowans about climate change, and
empowering individuals to take personal action to mitigate climate change. The ISU Extension
will again play a pivotal role in this step, hosting another series of statewide town meetings to
launch the plan. We would invite the participation of numerous other organizations as well. Such
organizations would include (but are not limited to): Iowa private colleges, community colleges,
4-H Clubs, Chambers of Commerce, the utilities and natural gas providers, Interfaith Power &
Light, school boards, Boy/Girl Scouts, and I-RENEW.
The work of these organizations would be supported as needed by training sessions, printed
materials, videos and Web casts, a Web site dedicated to the campaign, and other outreach
resources. Empowering citizens will be given a high priority, and teams will be trained to present
specific issues and address designated target audiences. The content presented would depend on
the findings of Step 1, but could include such subject areas as reducing your carbon footprint,
weatherizing homes for the elderly, planning and building community bike trails, designing new
homes and retrofitting old homes to optimize energy efficiency, installing ground-source heat
pumps, and improving energy efficiency in school buildings. We would add an interactive
component to the education/empowerment campaign by installing a Wiki Web site to promote

dialogue with the Iowa public. All citizens and communities that conduct positive actions will be
encouraged to report those actions at town meetings or on the project Web site.
Step 3: Impact Assessment, Recognizing Success, Public Dissemination (Year 3)
This step will ensure that the work of the education campaign is quantified, rewarded, and
disseminated to the wider public, both statewide and nationally. Another set of town meetings
hosted by the Extension Service will facilitate this step. A post-education-campaign survey will
be conducted and compared to the baseline survey completed in Step 1 to measure the degree to
which the campaign succeeded in moving the public from “simple awareness” to “personal
conduct knowledge.” All citizen and community actions reported at the county meetings will be
entered into the project’s database for cataloguing and assessment. A carbon footprint calculator
will be applied to quantify reductions in GHG emissions based on the reported actions. The
results of the assessment will be documented in a written report and posted on the Internet.
Competitions will be set up among counties for the most successful and creative actions
conducted to mitigate climate change. A team of judges will be appointed to select the winners,
who will receive awards at the State Capitol with much fanfare. A set of case studies based on
the individuals and communities entering the competition will be prepared, and a book featuring
their work will be published and posted on the Internet. The successes of the education campaign
will be aggressively publicized via radio, television, print media, Web site postings, and other
effective ways to disseminate the results.
Evaluation of the Project
The project will be evaluated in multiple ways. Surveys gauging knowledge about climate
change and actions that can be taken to mitigate it will be administered before and after the
education campaign. The analysis will provide an assessment of the extent to which citizens
progressed from “simple awareness” to “personal conduct knowledge.” The number of
participants at the county meetings will be tallied, as well as the number of individuals and
communities conducting positive actions to reduce GHG emissions. The carbon footprint
calculator will quantify reductions in GHG emissions resulting from those positive actions, and
the number of “hits” on the Wiki Web site will be tracked.
Timing: The education campaign will take 3 years, with each of the three steps conducted in
consecutive years. It would be preferable to begin Step 1 in early 2009.
Parties Involved: The University of Northern Iowa, Iowa State University, University of Iowa,
private colleges, junior colleges, 4-H Clubs, Chambers of Commerce, the utilities and natural gas
providers, Interfaith Power & Light, school boards, Boy/Girl Scouts, and I-RENEW. This list is
by no means exhaustive, and other collaborations will be sought as the campaign evolves.
Other: None currently identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
The proposed Climate Change Public Education and Outreach Program is ready to be
implemented, as detailed in the three-step plan described above. Each of the three Regents

Universities has agreed to participate and is prepared to begin the project as soon as funding is
secured.
The education campaign will focus on individual and community-wide efforts to lower the
carbon footprint of participating members. Carbon emission reductions will be achieved by
promoting measures, such as implementing ENERGY STAR appliances, bicycling and walking as
alternatives to car transport, installing geothermal heat pumps, and designing new homes and
retrofitting old homes to optimize energy efficiency.
The campaign will implement a Web-based carbon footprint calculator so that participants can
quantify reductions in GHG emissions from their reported reduction actions. The cumulative
emission reductions will be summed for an overall measure of the metric tons of equivalent
carbon dioxide (tCO2e) saved. This calculation will most likely underestimate total carbon
reductions, as it is not expected that all reductions actions will be measured or reported.
At this time it is not possible to calculate the costs per tCO2e saved. However, they can be
estimated by asking the participants who log on to the calculator to estimate the costs of
implementing their reduction measures. The cumulative sum of the reported implementation
costs, plus the costs of the education campaign itself, can provide an estimated overall cost. This
cost can be divided by the estimated tons of equivalent CO2 saved.
Once funding is in hand, the Regents Universities will seek collaboration among the other
organizations described above in the Parties Involved section.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
Currently, no related programs are in place in the state that cover education and outreach areas to
the same depth and breadth as the proposed three-step plan described here. Numerous straw
policy options from other ICCAC subcommittees have educational components, which are
currently unfunded as well.

The main benefit will be a means for empowering individuals and communities to do their part in
reducing GHGs. Many Iowans would be willing to lower their carbon footprint, but lack
understanding of the issues and information about positive actions that can be undertaken. The
campaign will seek to bridge the gaps in understanding and know-how.
It is expected that the benefits will extend well beyond the timeframe of the campaign and the
number of people who actually participate in it. The statewide dissemination effort described in
Step 3 will demonstrate the success of the campaign and encourage other individuals and
communities to participate. An educated and informed public will most likely ensure that the
momentum built during the 3-year campaign will be self-sustaining after the campaign has
officially ended.

CC-6. Seek Funding and Financing for Implementation of ICCAC Options

Policy Description
Funding must be obtained to implement some ICCAC options. In Iowa there are two
organizations that fund projects related to the ICCAC goals: the Iowa Power Fund and the Iowa
Energy Center, both described below. Out-of-state and federal funding sources should also be
considered. For all sources of funding, success would be enhanced through partnerships with
other organizations and agencies.
Policy Design
Goals: Establish financing mechanisms and obtain funding necessary to implement the ICCAC's
options.
Timing: Seek funding beginning in 2009 for implementation of the ICCAC's options. A
schedule can be created after the ICCAC prioritizes which grants or foundations will be
approached.
Parties Involved: Key partners in seeking financing and funding mechanisms could include
federal and state policy makers, NGOs, business representatives, academic community, financial
investment managers, citizens, and others.
Other: None currently identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
The ICCAC will need to determine who is responsible for writing grant proposals or approaching
foundations for funding, as well as prioritizing which organizations should be approached first.
The ICCAC may also consider hiring a grant writer, if necessary.
Related Policies/Programs in Place
The Iowa legislature created both the ICCAC and Iowa Power Fund Board in 2007. Although the
two organizations are separate, they share similar goals of GHG reduction and control of climate
change through increased energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. The Iowa Power Fund
consists of an appropriation of $25 million per year for 4 years. The funds are to be used to
increase Iowa’s research, development, and use of sources of renewable energy, improve
efficiency, and reduce GHG emissions. Applications can come from businesses, individuals,
government entities, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions. Projects are evaluated on
their originality, impact, and amount of cost shared by others. More details are available on the
OEI's Web site at http://www.energy.iowa.gov.
Another Iowa source of funding is the Iowa Energy Center, which provides two funding options.
The conference and small demonstration grants provide up to $7,500, and proposals are accepted
throughout the year. Pre-proposals for larger projects must be submitted annually; if accepted a

full proposal is requested. More details are available on the Iowa Energy Center Web site at
http://www.energy.iastate.edu.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Not applicable.
Estimated GHG Savings and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Not applicable.
Key Uncertainties
The key uncertainties are whether there will be adequate resources and staff to implement the
CAP options, whether there will be a sustainable commitment from state and local political
leaders, and whether funds will be forthcoming from the Midwestern Governors GHG Accord
process for the states.
Additional Benefits and Costs
Many grants require cost sharing. Partnering with other organizations may help secure these
matching funds, as well as lead to mutually beneficial networking and sharing of ideas.
Feasibility Issues
Although finding the time to write grants and securing cost share will be a challenge, it should be
within the powers of the members of the ICCAC.

CC-7. Adaptation and Vulnerability

Policy Description
Because of the existing buildup of GHGs in the atmosphere that has already occurred or is
underway, Iowa will experience effects of climate change for years to come, even if immediate
action is taken to reduce its future GHG emissions. While Iowa may be less dramatically affected
than coastal or arid regions of the country, the state will need to adapt to different sets of
vulnerabilities, which may include such impacts as increased public health risks, urban
infrastructure demands, and refugee movement. Thus, it is essential that the state develop a plan
to manage the projected impacts of global climate change affecting Iowa, while broader
mitigation efforts to lower atmospheric concentrations worldwide are being developed and
implemented. Part of our adaptation must include strategies for mitigating and addressing human
suffering, so that no one segment of the population or any of Iowa's natural resources or natural
heritage sites suffers catastrophically.
Policy Design
Iowa should develop, adopt, and implement a Climate Change Adaptation Plan that includes
identification of scenarios covering (1) potential short-, mid-, and long-term impacts of climate
change that may affect the state, and (2) implementation mechanisms for addressing these
impacts.
That being said, given that the effects of climate change are already happening, the state cannot
simply wait for a report before taking action to adapt to these known and predictable changes.
Each segment of the Iowa economy and community, and appropriate representatives of each of
Iowa's natural heritage areas should begin immediately to develop action plans to offer assistance
to those most dramatically affected, mitigation of those impacts where feasible, specific
initiatives to draw down their GHG emissions, and most important, strategies for remaining
viable and robust by adaptation to changing circumstances.
These action plans should be collated and redacted into a single coherent State of Iowa
Adaptation Plan that avoids contradictions, increases efficiencies, minimizes redundancies, and
fills in the gaps. The state Climate Change Adaptation Plan should include at least the following
key elements:
•

Comprehensive identification of potential short-, mid-, and long-term impacts associated
with climate change in Iowa.

•

Recommended steps to minimize risk to humans, natural and economic systems, water
resources, temperature-sensitive populations and systems, energy systems, transportation
systems, communications systems, vital infrastructure and public facilities, and natural lands
(such as wetlands, forests, and farmland), and all other identified and affected sectors or
areas of concern throughout the state.

•

Coordination of response efforts through the appropriate state, local, and federal agencies,
organizations, or other entities or initiatives.

•

Characterization of the potential risks and costs of inaction; characterization of the potential
costs, benefits, and co-benefits associated with specific policy and program actions; and
establishment of time- and program-based goals.

•

Use of cost-effectiveness analysis to guide and inform the development and implementation
of the state Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The analysis should include an examination of
the benefits and costs of adaptation measures or responses relative to a status quo or noaction approach, and the resources needed to implement adaptation measures in the plan. The
results of the cost-effectiveness analysis should also be used to set priorities for addressing
short-, mid-, and long-term impacts of climate change on Iowa's citizens, ecosystems, and
economy.

•

Creation of a scientific strategy that engages the public, educational institutions, and state
agencies in the monitoring of climate and ecological trajectories in Iowa to improve updates
to the Adaptation Plan.

•

Adaptation measures that also mitigate GHG emissions should be given priority in the state
Climate Change Adaptation Plan.

•

The Plan should be reviewed and updated every 5–10 years to expand or refine it as
necessary, to improve its implementation, and to incorporate new information as it becomes
available.

Goals:
• Develop a comprehensive state Climate Change Adaptation Plan that identifies opportunities
to address adaptation issues and risks to Iowa citizens and recommends tangible,
implementation measures to mitigate them.
•

Conduct cost-effectiveness analyses comparing the potential costs of a status quo approach,
as opposed to implementing the options proposed in the Climate Change Adaptation Plan.

•

Prioritize options in the Adaptation Plan, based on the certainty and severity of adverse
impacts to citizens, ecosystems, and local economies.

•

Ensure that development of the plan (1) involves all affected agencies and entities at all
levels of government; (2) engages all affected sectors and interests; and (c) provides for
periodic review and update concerning adaptation risks, responses, and opportunities in the
state.

Timing: The smaller local groups should begin immediately. “Low-hanging fruit” opportunities
should be addressed as rapidly as feasible (even before the Climate Change Adaptation Plan is
established, if possible), and proactive adaptation initiatives should commence within the next 2–
3 years. The Climate Action Adaptation Plan should be in place by the first intermediate timeline
of 5 years. Parallel public education and outreach efforts regarding adaptation should commence
immediately.
Parties Involved: The following constituencies should be called upon to create action plans:
state and local governments; school districts and institutions of higher learning; hospitals, clinics,
and hospices; agriculture organizations; NGOs, including such environmental organizations as

The Nature Conservancy Iowa, and the Sierra Club; religious congregations; and social service
organizations.
The Governor and the Iowa legislature should pursue the possible establishment of a
Commission on Adaptation to Climate Change, including proper funding. The commission
should then involve and coordinate with all appropriate state and local agencies, organizations,
and institutions (e.g., universities) to ensure that all potential impacts are identified and to ensure
the successful development and implementation of the plan. The role of ICCAC, if any, needs to
be defined.
Implementation Mechanisms
•

Review available reports from state and national adaptation plans.

•

Develop a catalog of adaptation policy options.

•

Prioritize options and recommend possible standards and codes.

•

Provide public education and outreach programs.

•

Coordinate with existing state agencies to establish and maintain a Web-based resource for
adaptation to the most pressing vulnerabilities.

Related Policies/Programs in Place
Federal, state, and local emergency response plans for natural disasters. The need to coordinate
with these agencies to evaluate potential increases in violent weather (due to climate change) is
essential for our citizens. Such an initiative is already emanating from Iowa State University,
where professors are leading the drive for a “Climate Science and Impacts Initiative.”
The state is taking steps to address the aftermath of the recent tornadoes and floods in Iowa
through the “Rebuild Iowa” effort.
IDNR has hired a staff person within the Conservation and Recreation Division to prepare a
strategy for dealing with the ecological climate change effects on water, soils, forests and
prairies, fisheries, and wildlife.
Type(s) of GHG Reductions
Not applicable.
Estimated GHG Savings and Net Costs or Cost Savings
Not applicable.
Key Uncertainties
There is uncertainty about the nature, magnitude, and geographic variability of impacts that will
result from climate change in Iowa. There is also uncertainty regarding impacts on public health
and on wildlife and migration patterns.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Adaptation will most likely entail significant costs for such items as increased flood protection
facilities and greater fortification of buildings of all kinds.
Feasibility Issues
It is probably not feasible to move towns entirely out of floodplains. It will also be difficult to
devise measures to improve adaptability to the increased numbers and severity of tornadoes.

CC-8. Participate in Regional and Multistate GHG Reduction Efforts

Policy Description
Regional approaches undertaken in collaboration with partner states or other organizations can
offer broader and more economically efficient opportunities to reduce GHG emissions across
Iowa’s economy. Iowa has already joined several organizations, including the Midwestern
Greenhouse Gas Accord, the Midwestern Governors Energy Security and Climate Stewardship
Platform, and the multistate Climate Registry initiatives. These developments should be
continued and should form the basis for Iowa’s own programs. To the extent that Iowa’s needs
may not be fully met by these initiatives, Iowa should consider developing supplemental or
ancillary registry capacity or opportunity. (See CC-1.)
Policy Design
Goals:
• Work to develop these regional programs so that Iowa's interests are protected, while
meeting Iowa’s goals of developing capacity to reduce the state's GHG emissions effectively.
•

Ensure the cost-effective reduction of GHG emissions in a manner that maximizes public
benefits, induces innovation in energy efficiency and sustainable energy technologies, and
avoids inequitable impacts.

•

Maximize economic and employment opportunities, while minimizing transitional job losses.

•

Iowa needs to establish GHG reduction scenarios and time frames consistent with the other
member states' own scenarios, help to develop a market-based and multisector cap-and-trade
mechanism, and continue to develop other mechanisms and policies to achieve the proposed
reduction scenarios.

•

Establish links to other jurisdictions and systems to create economies of scale, increasing
efficiency and diversity.

•

Address the ability to integrate and potential actions taken by federal programs.

Timing: Iowa should move forward in the 2009 legislative session to address any needed
regional initiatives associated with implementation of the Midwestern Regional GHG Accord.
The GHG Accord was signed on November 15, 2007. Various time lines within the Accord have
a target completion of 30 months after the signature date.
The Energy Security and Climate Stewardship Platform for the Midwest was also signed on
November 15, 2007. The dates mentioned in the Platform include 2012, 2015, 2020, 2025, 2030,
and 2050.
Parties Involved: Currently, six states (Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, and
Wisconsin) and one Canadian province (Manitoba) are signatory to the Accord. In addition, three

other states (Indiana, Ohio, and South Dakota) have signed as observers to participate in regional
cap-and-trade issues.
Implementation Mechanisms
Iowa needs to work with other states through the Midwestern GHG Accord to develop and
implement an approach to reducing GHG emissions within the region, recognizing that each state
will have unique problems to address. These efforts should include consulting on a regional capand-trade policy, and/or a carbon tax system.

Additional Benefits and Costs
Costs will be associated with implementing the Midwestern Regional GHG Accord and any
potential new federal programs. Reducing GHG emissions will have the ancillary benefit of
improving Iowa's economy and energy security.
Feasibility Issues
It is more difficult to tailor larger national or regional program elements to Iowa-specific needs.

CC-9. Encourage the Creation of a Business-Oriented Organization
to Facilitate Investment in Climate-Related Business Opportunities
and to Share Information and Strategies, Recognize Successes,
and Support Aggressive GHG Reduction Goals

Policy Description
Numerous economic and business opportunities can arise from implementing a comprehensive
GHG reduction strategy for Iowa. A variety of job creation possibilities are implicit in new
approaches to transportation, land use, green construction, recycling and reuse, and energyefficient products and services. The state should work with public and private entities to identify,
promote, and finance these opportunities for economic development and job creation. Iowa
should also work to keep existing green jobs in Iowa and prevent them from moving out of state.
The growth of the “green industry” has the potential to benefit low- to mid-skill workers who can
no longer depend on traditional manufacturing jobs. Since green jobs require applied technical
skills, they generally pay decent wages. Unlike blue-collar jobs, many green-collar jobs require
local employees and cannot be outsourced.
Another component of economic development is the promotion of buying locally produced
foods, goods, and products. Consumer support for the local economy helps sustain Iowa
businesses, jobs, and tax base, while reducing the consumption of fuel (and CO2 emissions) in
the transportation of foods and products over great distances.
Policy Design
In Iowa, the opportunities for creating green jobs are numerous, including designing and
constructing green buildings; weatherizing existing buildings; retrofitting older buildings with
energy-efficient appliances and technologies; expanding the construction, maintenance, and
operation of common-carrier and public transportation networks and systems; designing,
constructing, and operating windmills, biomass generators, and solar collectors; and research and
development of a wide array of new practices and technologies that can abate GHG production.
A business-oriented organization should be established or assigned responsibility to help
promote these opportunities related to climate change in Iowa. Promotion of consumption of
locally produced foods and goods will also strengthen Iowa's economy.
Goals: Targeted business promotion and job creation should be a part of Iowa’s effort to
mitigate GHG emissions. Iowa should build upon its momentum to make every effort to
establish itself as a leader in developing green industries.
OEI administers the Iowa Power Fund, a $100 million effort over 4 years to support research,
development, commercialization, and deployment of biofuels, renewable energy technologies,
and energy-efficient technologies while seeking to cut GHG emissions. One criterion on which
proposals for the Fund are judged is their ability to create economic opportunity in Iowa and
future green collar jobs. OEI coordinates their efforts with the Iowa Department of Economic

Development (IDED), the State of Iowa Facilities Improvement Corporation, the Renewable
Fuel Infrastructure Program, the Value-Added Agricultural Products and Processes Financial
Assistance Program, the Enterprise Zone Program, and High-Quality Job Creation Program.
Timing: As soon as possible to build on OEI projects.
Parties Involved: Universities, IDED, Chambers of Commerce, energy utilities, existing green
businesses and industries, energy conservation experts, and individual businesses across the
state.
Other: None currently identified.
Implementation Mechanisms
A group of Iowa experts from across the state and across disciplines should be assembled to
develop a vision and strategies for developing and attracting businesses that will flourish in a
carbon-constrained world. The group should be tasked with developing key criteria that will be
used in evaluating potential business developments in Iowa. Sample criteria might include:
•

Will the business benefit from the carbon-constrained economy?

•

How will the potential business fare in a changing climate?

•

Will the business be based upon locally available materials?

•

Will the business be structured to allow reduction of commuting requirements for
employees?

•

Will the business be able to function in relation to existing businesses through the principles
of Industrial Ecology?

•

A GHG emission per dollar of product metric could be developed and used to scale economic
assistance.

The group should be tasked with providing recommendations to the Iowa legislature for the 2010
session.

Key Uncertainties
There is uncertainty about whether, and if so, who, will lead this initiative on behalf of the
business community, and how much business participation can be counted upon. There is also
uncertainty about the future of biofuels.
Additional Benefits and Costs
This endeavor could create more opportunities for new technology development. There can be
synergy among companies working on these types of similar ventures. While economic and
employment opportunities should be significant, significant costs will also most likely be
associated with implementation of some of the CAP elements. There is a significant promise that
development of green cellulosic crops could spur Iowa’s economy.
Feasibility Issues
Restructuring and retraining the work force to implement a new reduced-carbon energy economy
will be challenging. Iowa will need to gauge the cost-effectiveness of selected solutions along
the way.
