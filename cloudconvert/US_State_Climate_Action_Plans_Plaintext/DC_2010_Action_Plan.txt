Climate of Opportunity
A Climate Action Plan
for the District of Columbia

Dear Residents, Business Owners
and Partners for a Green DC:
What will a changing climate mean for each of us in the District of Columbia?
Records show that our average temperatures and water levels are rising, and recent
history shows just how much extreme weather can affect our daily lives.
But climate change can have another meaning as well: opportunity. For current residents, institutions and businesses, there are opportunities to save money and become more efficient consumers of energy and water. As new markets grow for
renewable energy, alternative fuel vehicles, and high efficiency buildings, additional
opportunities are created for new jobs and for businesses to expand and grow.
For all of us, there is the opportunity to envision what our city will be like in 2020 and
2050. How will a network of streetcars, bus lines, bike stations and Metro change our
travel habits? How will green and cool roofs and an enhanced tree canopy make our
neighborhoods cooler, more livable and more beautiful? How can we realize the opportunity climate change presents to increase the wealth and health of our city?
Every day, our actions at home, school and work affect our emissions of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Likewise, we have opportunities each day in
the way we commute and move around the city, the way we buy and use energy, and
the way we build (or rebuild) our city to maximize efficiency, build smarter, and plan
not just for this year and next, but for the city we’ll leave to the next generation.
Last year, I tasked our District agencies to come up with an aggressive but achievable plan to reduce the “carbon footprint” of our government. This document contains a detailed list and the estimated impacts of these “government operations
actions.” I also asked them to put together an overview of actions that others outside of the District government can take to address greenhouse gas emissions from
our community as a whole. This document contains an overview of these “community actions” to serve as a starting point for discussion of our collective efforts to reduce our emissions.
I invite you to join us today in envisioning the opportunities for the future, and to engage with the Fenty Administration and people across our community as we work
together to further our Green DC Agenda.
Mayor Adrian M. Fenty

1 Executive Summary
How efficient and competitive will the District be in 2020 and 2050? How will residents
and businesses adapt to a changing climate and economy? How can we ensure that
the District remains the economic engine for our metropolitan area and the place where
people want to live and businesses want to grow?
When Mayor Fenty released the Green DC Agenda in April 2009, he called for developing a visionary plan to address climate change in the nation’s capital. Planning for
climate change means identifying opportunities to live and work more efficiently and
working aggressively to create jobs and strengthen the local economy. The same actions that will help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as retrofitting homes,
schools and office buildings, will create jobs for people who design and build cuttingedge facilities, people who sell and install the latest green technologies, and people
who provide goods and services to those industries.
For the past year, agencies across the District Government have been working to
measure the District’s “carbon footprint”—the amount of greenhouse gases we release each year—and to draft a plan with specific targets and actions to reduce our
emissions. Our draft plan focuses on this “Climate of Opportunity” and will begin an
open, public engagement to help refine just what your District Government can do,
and just what the city’s businesses and residents can do, to create a cooler, greener,
and more efficient city for the 21st Century.

Challenges and Opportunities
Cities like Washington present both challenges and opportunities with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. As the hub of economic activity, transportation, and as a dense
population center, our city produces significant greenhouse gas emissions. During calendar year 2006, the District’s greenhouse gas emissions totaled 10.5 million metric

Draft for Community Discussion

The term “CO2e” (carbon dioxide equivalents) is used throughout this document to refer to the family of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate
change. These gases are outlined in Table ES.1, which includes the typical
sources of these gases and their global warming potential (GWP), a measure of
the level of potency of a particular greenhouse gas, as measured against CO2.
Methane (CH4) is a relatively weak greenhouse gas with a GWP of 21, whereas
sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is 23,900 times more potent than CO2. It is important to
note that not all of these sources of emissions are relevant to the District.
tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), or 18 tons CO2e for each
District resident.
Compared to other cities, the District’s per capita emissions are relatively high. A leading driver of these high emissions is the fact that
the District’s daytime population swells by 400,000 workers every
workday, which is the largest percentage increase in daytime population of any large city in the nation. Carbon emissions are also
high because much of the District’s electricity comes from burning
coal at distant power plants. This carbon-intensive power must be
transmitted to the city over long distances, resulting in distribution
losses of energy.
Buildings are by far the largest contributors to our emissions profile, with residential, non-residential and federal buildings together
accounting for 74% of the District’s total emissions. Reducing
building energy use is a challenge central to the success of the District’s Climate Action Plan.

Despite higher emissions than some comparison cities, the District
enjoys many advantages and opportunities to achieve greater efficiency. Dense development, availability of mass transit, and walkable neighborhoods inherently support our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. The District’s Climate Action Plan should take advantage of the opportunities presented by our urban infrastructure to ensure efficiency gains.

Significant Efforts Are Already Underway
The District has in place a number of progressive policies and programs that are reducing energy use and promoting renewable energy and alternative transportation,
lowering our emissions of greenhouse gases. These policies have already elevated the
District to the top of many measures of urban sustainability. The Green Building Act,
Clean and Affordable Energy Act, and 2008 Construction Codes set the stage for
greening our buildings, which account for 74% of our city’s greenhouse gas emissions. Thanks to strong adoption by the private sector, the District has more LEED and
Energy Star certified buildings than any city our size.
Green and “cool” roofs keep buildings more comfortable and save energy and the District has one of the most aggressive green roof programs in the country. Our public and
private buildings have over 800,000 square feet of green roofs (second in the nation behind Chicago). Green and cool roofs help cool our city, improve air quality, and reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently recognized the District as
a national leader (third among cities nationwide) in purchasing renewable power. The
city’s renewable portfolio standard, which will require electric power sold into the city
to be 20% renewable by 2020. The renewable energy incentive program is funding
more than 200 residential and business photovoltaic installations each year.
Perhaps Washington’s strongest legacy of environmental stewardship is in the acceptance and use of sustainable transportation. Thirty-nine percent of residents commute by mass transit and more than a third of households—37%—do not even own
cars. Car-sharing, fleet-sharing by the District Government and bike sharing are all expanding and will allow us to be less and less reliant on fossil fuel and further decrease
our greenhouse gas emissions.

The Need for a Climate Action Plan
A wide array of business owners, institutions, neighborhood groups, and individual citizens has already made significant efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the
District, and we need to build on these successes. A comprehensive and communitywide Climate Action Plan will coordinate public and private sector efforts, foster dialogue and learning opportunities among stakeholder groups, and maintain focus on
high-impact actions. Having a climate action plan drives progress towards reduction
targets to achieve our goals in the short, medium and long-term.
Likewise, the Government of the District of Columbia is committed to meeting the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its Government Operations. The District Government’s policies, practices and programs will contribute to a city-wide effort
to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the city will lead by example.
Many efforts to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases also have the added benefit of helping to prepare and protect the District from the negative impacts of climate
change, including sea level rise, flooding, and increasing urban heat. Shifting to low
carbon strategies will help local residents and businesses grow in a clean energy economy and position the District for future growth. Smarter use of energy means a more
efficient city and lower costs for government, residents, and businesses. A low-carbon
development strategy builds on our strengths as a transit-friendly, walkable city to pro4

Mitigation and Adaptation
Although mitigating climate change is important and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are a priority for the District of Columbia, climate change
adaptation efforts are equally critical. Generally speaking, climate change
adaptation activities focus on the ways in which vulnerable populations, including those living in urban environments and particularly lower-income residents, can prepare for and cope with the threats posed by climate change. For
example, the District Government could ensure that new or upgraded infrastructure is not located in floodplains or low-lying areas. The goal of a Climate
Action Plan is not only to set targets to reduce our carbon footprint, but also to
plan to make the city stronger and more resilient to climate change.
vide a better quality of life for all District residents, workers and
visitors.

The District Government’s Commitment –
Aggressive and Achievable Emissions Reductions
The Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory showed that in calendar year 2006, operations of the District of Columbia Government
were about 6% of the total emissions for the District, or 720,000
metric tons of CO2e.
To capitalize on the many benefits of energy efficiency and
climate protection, the District Government is committing to
reduce its emissions by 20% below 2006 levels by 2012, 30%
below 2006 levels by 2020, and 80% below 2006 levels by
2050. i

These are aggressive and achievable targets, and are consistent
with the most forward-looking targets adopted by comparable jurisdictions, regional agencies, or proposed in federal legislation.
The 2012 and 2020 targets have been modeled to be attainable
based on measures the District Government currently has already implemented, or
has planned or proposed. Reductions in 2050 have considerably more uncertainty surrounding them, but rely on the best information currently available pertaining to future
changes to building codes, vehicle fuel efficiency standards, and other innovations
over the next 40 years.

Measures to Reduce Emissions from Government Operations
Achieving the target greenhouse gas emissions reductions for District Government
Operations will require all District agencies and employees to work together toward
these greenhouse gas reduction goals. Table ES.4 identifies the 17 core mitigation
measures the District Government will pursue to reach the Government Operations
greenhouse gas reduction targets. Each measure is identified and described briefly,
including estimates of the potential greenhouse gas emissions reductions that the
measure could achieve in years 2012, 2020, and 2050.

The list of Government Operations measures was developed by incorporating activities from the Mayor’s Green DC Agenda that have direct climate benefits, and by reviewing best practices from other cities around the nation and world. The measures
detailed in this Draft Climate Action Plan were selected because they have the greatest potential to reduce greenhouse gas from the District’s main sources and because
they were quantifiable.
There are many other programs and policies that can have positive climate, energy efficiency and green results; however some of these measures are not
quantifiable under standard emissions reductions protocols, like that used by
ICLEI in developing the District’s Climate Action Plan. Many of these policies
and programs also have ancillary environmental and human health benefits, as
discussed later in this report.

Our Community As A Whole – The ‘Carbon Footprint’
Our city-wide greenhouse gas emissions for 2006 totaled 10.5 million metric tons CO2e,
from buildings (residential, non-residential, and federal); vehicles (indicated as VMT or vehicle miles traveled); mass transit (Metro); and waste. Figure ES.5 provides a breakdown
of the specific energy sources of our greenhouse gas emissions, including electricity,
natural gas, fuel oil, vehicle fuel (gasoline and diesel), kerosene, and emissions from solid
waste. Electricity consumption is our largest driver of greenhouse gas emissions.
If no action is taken, greenhouse gas emissions in the District are expected to rise by
14% by 2020 and 35% by 2050 due mainly to population growth. However, many cli-

What are the realistic options for
community targets and mitigation
measures? These are the options
we will develop together during the
community engagement process.
There are, however, examples and
guidelines for us to refer to. Employing the measures discussed in the report (and others identified during the public
planning process), the District as a community should meet or exceed the Metropolitan
Washington Council of Governments recommended regional goals of reducing emissions by 10% in 2012, 20% in 2020, and 80% in 2050. ii

Measures to Reduce Emissions from the Community
Achieving significant greenhouse gas emissions reductions will require all sectors of the
community to work together toward these common goals. Table ES.5 summarizes policies and programs that could have quantifiable impacts on reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. In Section 6.2, each proposed measure is identified and described in more
detail.

Second, you can participate in a series of public
forums and meetings
convened by DDOE to
gather input and comments on the proposed
Government Operations
Plan (Section 6.1) and
the Community Discussion Draft (Section 6.2).

Reviewing this Draft Plan
This Draft Climate Action Plan is organized in eight sections. Sections 2 through 5
present background information on climate change and provide data specific to the
District of Columbia. Section 6.1 presents a draft blueprint for greenhouse gas emissions reductions from District Government Operations. It includes targets for emissions reductions within short, medium and long-term timelines, and proposes the key
actions that will make these commitments a reality.
Section 6.2 presents a discussion draft of measures aimed at reducing greenhouse
gas emissions from the entire community. These include policies and programs already in place, like the Green Building Act and Clean and Affordable Energy Act, and
others that could be put in place to achieve significant energy savings and emissions
reductions in the short, medium and long-term. Although many forward-looking actions aimed at increasing energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are
currently underway across the city, the community portion of this plan is intended to
spur a wide-ranging dialogue and initiate a public process to develop comprehensive,
community-wide targets and actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Description

Buildings

Green Building Act

Starting in 2012, the Green Building Act will require all buildings over
50,000 square feet to meet the US Green Building Council Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certified standard.

Buildings

Sustainable Energy
Utility

The Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 redirects utility assessment
fees to finance a new Sustainable Energy Utility to promote efficiency and
demand reduction projects throughout the city.

Buildings

Renewable Portfolio
Standard

The Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 requires all suppliers selling
electric power into the District to use renewable sources in an amount that
will increase to 20% in 2020.

Buildings

Greening the
Building Code

The District has adopted the latest international energy efficiency codes
for commercial buildings and a requirement that residential properties be
30% more efficient than base codes. Codes will be greened further in the
2010 and regularly thereafter.

Buildings

Property Assessed
Clean Energy (PACE)

The District will offer long-term loans to property owners, to be repaid on
their property tax bills, to finance energy efficiency retrofits of residential,
multi-family, and commercial properties citywide.

Buildings

Office and Residential Energy Efficiency
Retrofits and
Weatherization

The District Department of the Environment plans to offer ongoing
programs that promote energy savings in homes through retrofits and
weatherization.

Buildings

Energy Efficiency
Improvements for
Federal Buildings

President Obama’s Executive Order 13514 requires all federal agencies to
set energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction goals. This requirement will affect millions of square feet of office space in the District.

Buildings

Green Building and
Energy “Challenges”
to Key Sectors

The District will promote lead-by-example competition within key sectors
(e.g. universities, international institutions, federal agencies) through
challenges that catalyze large scale efficiency improvements.

Buildings

“District” Heating
and Energy Systems

The District has a number of “district”, or centralized, heating and energy
systems that service major institutions and the government. Energy
savings could be achieved by increasing the efficiency of these central
power plants or expanding their service areas.

Buildings

Solar Co-ops and
other Micro-Utilities

Solar cooperatives have already helped expand the use of renewable
energy (particularly solar) in the District. Using and expanding the
cooperative model will promote installation of renewable energy on
rooftops, parking, yards, parks, rights of way, streets, and other space.

Buildings

Power Purchase
Agreements (PPAs)

Renewable energy providers are using PPAs to fund installation of on-site
generation (particularly solar photovoltaic systems) on roofs and other
space “rented” from private parties. PPA agreements give consumers
fixed rate power and, after the term of the agreement, ownership of the
renewable energy system.

Buildings

Purchase of
Renewable Power

Consumers in the District already have the choice to purchase up to 100%
renewable-source electric power. Education and cooperative purchasing
can promote expanded renewable purchasing by residents, businesses
and institutions.

Buildings

Green and Reflective
“Cool” Roofing

Use of green and reflective “cool roofs” can greatly reduce the energy
used to cool buildings and make the buildings more comfortable for users
at a relatively low cost. Cool roofs can also help combat the urban heat
island effect, which keeps the inner city hotter than other areas throughout
the year.

The District Department of Transportation is now installing the Anacostia
and Benning Road Streetcar lines and will expand this system in phases
to provide rail mass transit service to neighborhoods not served by Metro.

Transportation

Bike Share
Program Expansion

Continued expansion of the Capital Bikeshare system will provide
convenient bike transit options to residents and visitors and reduce
vehicle miles traveled.

Transportation

Bicycle Master
Plan Implementation

Continued expansion of cycling facilities and bike lanes under the Bicycle
Master Plan will increase the percent of commuters bicycling and reduce
vehicle miles traveled.

Transportation

Performance
Based Parking

Increasing the cost of parking in high demand areas reduces congestion
and encourages drivers to use mass transit, bicycling, or walking.

Transportation

Incentives for
Hybrid Vehicles

The District’s incentives for hybrid vehicles have and will continue to
speed adoption of hybrid vehicles and improve the collective fuel
economy of cars in the city.

Transportation

managers and tenants to improve commercial recycling rates and reduce
emissions.

Waste

Increase Residential
Recycling

The District plans to increase residential recycling through outreach and
expansion of programs that make residential recycling more appealing.

Waste

Waste to Energy

A portion of the District’s municipal waste is incinerated in a waste-toenergy plant, reducing greenhouse gas (methane) emissions from landfills.

Waste

Organic Waste
Composting

Increasing the amount of leaf matter, yard waste, and food waste collected
for composting reduces greenhouse gas (methane) emissions from
landfills.

CrossCutting

Local Climate
Offset/Benefit Fund

A voluntary program would allow businesses, institutions or individuals to
“purchase” additional greenhouse gas emissions through private donations
to support projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the
District’s boundaries. Donations could be official carbon offsets or
unofficial carbon benefits.

CrossCutting

Green Purchasing

The use of these products reduces environmental impacts associated with
the manufacture, use and disposal of many items in common daily use.

2 Introduction
The District of Columbia is well positioned to play a leadership role in addressing the
causes and effects of climate change through actions at both the community and government operations levels. The Government of the District of Columbia is committed to
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from its operations, and is emerging as a national
leader in climate mitigation best practices such as green building, renewable energy, and alternative transportation. The District Government’s
policies, practices and programs will contribute to a city-wide effort to

Governments for Sustainability. A non-profit
membership organization representing over
500 cities and local governments, ICLEI has
global expertise in assessing climate impacts, devising specific measures to reduce
emissions, and providing local jurisdictions
with comprehensive Climate Action Plans. In
January 2010, the District reached Milestone
1 with the release of the Greenhouse Gas Inventory detailing our “carbon footprint,”
against which our efforts to reduce climate
emissions will be measured. This draft Climate Action Plan represents progress toward Milestones 2 and 3.

Climate Change Science Background
and Forecasted Local and Regional Impacts

The balance of naturally occurring gases dispersed in
the Earth’s atmosphere determines our climate by trapping solar radiation—a phenomenon known as the
greenhouse effect. Overwhelming evidence indicates that
modern human activity is artificially intensifying the greenhouse gas effect, and that global average surface temperatures
are rising. This intensification is caused by natural processes and
human activities that release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere—most notably the burning of
fossil fuels for transportation, electricity, and heat generation. iii
Over the past 100 years, there have been noticeable effects of
global climate change in the District of Columbia. Increasing temperatures, sea and river level rise, altered precipitation trends and
more frequent and severe storms have all been recorded in the
District, and are projected to continue into the future. This section
summarizes environmental trends such as temperature and precipitation in and around the District.
Since 1907, average annual temperatures in the District have increased by approximately 3.3°F. These local temperature trends
coincide with regional trends, although the magnitude of change
in the Washington metro area is greater. Based on the average
temperatures and depending on the emissions scenario, the en-

Draft for Community Discussion

tire Mid-Atlantic region is expected to warm by 2-3°F by
2030 and 4-10°F by the end of
the century. Temperature increases in the District of Columbia are likely to be higher
than those in the surrounding
region due to the urban heat
island effect. iv
While there has been very little
change in the amount of average annual precipitation in the
District over the last 100 years,
less precipitation is falling as
snow. Both Maryland and Virginia have experienced trends
of increasing precipitation over
the past 100 years, with
growth rates of 0.27 inches per
decade and 0.31 inches per
decade, respectively. v Finally,
the increasing intensity and
frequency of extreme weather
events may be the most dramatic indicator of global climate change. Relative to the
previous century, there have been 12% to 20% more major weather events in the MidAtlantic region. vi

The global rate of sea level elevation, another ongoing result of global climate change,
is 0.08 inches per year, while the Chesapeake Bay rate is 0.14 inches per year. vii The
higher rate of sea level rise is the result of land subsidence or the erosion of land into
the sea, which accounts for roughly half the Mid-Atlantic regional sea level rise. The Potomac River has risen about one foot since 1933, most noticeably around the Tidal
Basin. viii Sea level rise is projected to increase by 24-48 inches over the next century
along the Chesapeake Bay as a result of the melting of polar ice caps combined with
the thermal expansion of sea water. A commensurate rise in sea level will occur along
the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers as well as Rock Creek over the next century, as all
three waterways are tidal and respond to rises in sea levels. ix, x Between 1.74-2.55
square miles of District land lies below 40 inches in elevation, land that is highly vulnerable to sea level rise and could potentially become inundated by the year 2100. A
total of 3.42 square miles are below 140 inches in elevation, and this land will be more
susceptible to episodic flooding and storm surges. xi For instance, land around the Tidal
Basin and the Jefferson Memorial in particular is in danger of inundation if long-term
projections are realized.

The District Department of the Environment, in partnership
with ICLEI and sister agencies across the government,
completed a District Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory
in January 2010. Also known as a “carbon footprint,” the Inventory estimates the total amount of carbon dioxide and
other greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere as a result of energy consumption, vehicle use and
other activities. Evaluating our greenhouse gas inventory is
best understood as placing a “bubble” over the city and
counting greenhouse gas emissions attributed to activities
that occur within the bubble (i.e., the District’s boundaries).
The Inventory estimates emissions attributed to both government operations and broader community activities
within the District during calendar year 2006 (selected as
our “baseline” year because of superior data quality and
accuracy). The community inventory includes estimated
greenhouse gas emissions from all building energy use, vehicles fuel use and transportation, and emissions from
waste streams. The government operations inventory,
which is a subset of the community inventory, provides a
much more in-depth analysis of emissions from the District
Government, including government-operated facilities and
streetlights, vehicle fleet and off-road equipment, and
waste generated by government operations.

3.1 Community Emissions Summary
In calendar year 2006, our city-wide greenhouse gas emissions from electricity consumption and other direct sources
totaled 10.5 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e), or 18 tons per resident. This amount is below
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s national average of 19.7 tons per person, but higher than other major
cities. Figure 3.1 provides a breakdown of emissions by
sector, including: buildings (residential, non-residential, and
federal); vehicles (indicated as VMT or vehicle miles traveled); mass transit (Metro); and waste. With 75% of our
greenhouse gas emissions linked to buildings, our most effective emissions reduction actions will target comprehensive energy use reduction in buildings. Figure 3.2 provides
a breakdown of the specific energy sources of our greenhouse gas emissions, including electricity, natural gas, fuel
oil, vehicle fuel (gasoline and diesel), kerosene, and emissions from solid waste. Electricity consumption is our
largest driver of greenhouse gas emissions.
Of the total emissions accounted for in this inventory, emissions from the Non-Residential sector were the largest
(51% as shown in Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1). The Residen-

16

tial sector was responsible for 14% of community emissions, with a total of 1.5 million metric tons of CO2e. Federal facilities managed by GSA accounted for 9% of
emissions, with a total of 963,000 metric tons of CO2e. Between Residential, Non-Residential, and Federal facilities,
emissions from buildings consisted of 74% of community
emissions. Emissions from the Vehicles sector were 2.3 million metric tons of CO2e, or 22% of total community emissions. Emissions from Metro were culled from the
Non-Residential sector and were 2% of the community
total, with 177,000 metric tons of CO2e. Finally, emissions
from the Solid Waste sector accounted for an estimated
186,000 metric tons of CO2e, also 2% of the community
total.

3.2 Government Operations Emissions
During the 2006 calendar year, the District’s government
operations direct emissions, emissions from electricity consumption, and select indirect sources totaled 720,000 metric tons of CO2e. xii Of the total emissions accounted for in
this inventory, the greatest levels of emissions were from Buildings & Other Facilities
(at 59%) and wastewater facilities (at 23%) of government operations emissions.
District Government agencies that reported costs and DC Water spent a cumulative
$124,420,635 on energy for their operations in 2006 (the true figure is higher as cost information was not universally reported). Of this total, 59% ($82,953,877) resulted from
Buildings & Other Facilities. See figures 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and Table 3.2 for more detailed information.

4 Emissions Growth Forecasts
Forecasting emissions growth is an essential component of developing an emissions inventory —without a projection of emissions growth it is impossible to make the informed
decisions required to set reduction targets and develop a specific climate action plan.
Emissions forecasts assume a “business as usual” scenario in which emissions per unit
of energy stay constant, but overall emissions increase as population and employment
growth is factored in. Thus, any changes to vehicle fuel efficiency or electricity emissions
factors, such as through the provision of renewable energy, are not included in the business as usual forecast. Rather, these measures are accounted for as part of the climate
action plan to meet the emissions reduction target.

4.1 Community Forecast
The District’s 2006 community emissions were estimated as a total of 10.5 million metric tons of CO2e. Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1 show projected growth in these emissions

through 2050. Emissions are forecasted to increase by 2050 to 14 million metric tons
of CO2e, an increase of approximately 23% under a “business as usual” scenario. The
growth scenarios shown are based on projections of increases population, employment and vehicle use developed by the Washington Metropolitan Council of Governments.

4.2 Government Operations Forecast
The District’s 2006 government operations emissions were estimated as a total of
720,000 metric tons of CO2e. Table 4.2 and Figure 4.2 show projected growth in these
emissions through 2050 using high, medium and low efficiency scenarios that incorporate growth in population. Under the medium efficiency scenario, emissions are forecasted to increase by 2050 to 888,000 metric tons of CO2e, an increase of
approximately 27% under a “business as usual” scenario. xiii
The three growth scenarios shown in Table 4.2 are based, in part, on projections of increases in employee efficiency – 0.5% annually under high efficiency, 0.25% under
medium efficiency, and no increase in efficiency under the low efficiency scenario.

5 Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Reduction Targets
Setting emissions reduction targets is Milestone 2 of ICLEI’s Five Milestones for Climate Protection. The emissions reduction target is the percentage by which a local
government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from government operations
below base year levels by selected future target years. The District has chosen to set
aggressive short-term, mid-term and long-term targets. Short-term targets help to
closely monitor progress and build momentum, while long-term targets set the bar for
the ultimate achievement in emissions reductions.

The District’s proposed Government Operations plan would reduce emissions by
20% below 2006 levels by 2012, 30% below 2006 levels by 2020, and 80% below
2006 levels by 2050. These target years are consistent with local and national target
years. The reduction targets are more aggressive than many peer jurisdictions in the
short term, and consistent with current scientific estimates of necessary emissions reductions in the long term. The 2012 and 2020 targets are aggressive but achievable
based on measures the District Government has implemented, planned or proposed.
Figure 5.1 (next page) depicts the relationship between the forecasted growth in emissions from 2006 to 2050 and the estimated impact the climate action plan measures
will have on reducing emissions.

What are the realistic options for community targets and mitigation measures? These
are the answers we will develop together during the community engagement process.
There are, however, examples and guidelines for us to refer to. Based on the assumptions and measures discussed in the report, the District as a community could strive
to meet or exceed the regional goals already adopted by Metropolitan Washington
Council of Governments to reduce emissions by 10% in 2012, 20% in 2020, and 80%
in 2050. xiv

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

6 The Climate Action Plan
Through the actions detailed in this plan, the District can reduce its emissions, become more energy independent, and ensure resiliency in the face of the climate change
that is already underway. The District Government has direct control over many sources
of emissions that result from the daily operation of government buildings, vehicles,
water and wastewater treatment facilities, street lights, and waste disposal. The District Government is pursuing number of progressive initiatives, and this plan focuses on the high-impact efforts that will allow the District of Columbia to meet
government operations emissions reduction targets of 20% by 2012, 30% by
2020, and 80% by 2050.

6.1 Government Operations Measures to Reduce Emissions
The Draft Climate Action Plan includes a combination of existing policies and programs and new ideas based on best practices from around the country. They are divided into five categories that correspond to sectors examined as part of the District’s
Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory:
•
•
•
•
•

Buildings
Transportation
Street Lighting
Water and Wastewater
Solid Waste

Government operations measures are specific to the day-to-day operations of the District Government. They apply to buildings the District Government owns or leases, vehicles used to provide services such as police protection and waste collection, lighting
of roadways, water distribution and treatment of wastewater, and disposal of solid
waste generated at District Government facilities. Collectively, these activities resulted
in emissions totaling 720,000 metric tons of CO2e in the 2006 base year.
The impact of the measures in each sector varies with the size of the sector. Table 6.1
shows the relative impact of each sector towards the District Government’s overall reduction. The figures below are for 2020, and the percentages for 2012 and 2050 are
comparable. As Table 6.1 indicates, the emissions reductions projected to be achieved
by this draft plan in each sector are roughly proportional to the contribution of each
sector towards the emissions baseline (shown in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1).

6.1.1 Buildings
As demonstrated in the District Greenhouse Gas Inventory, District Government building energy use accounted for the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions (59%).
To achieve significant reductions, therefore, District Government efforts must focus on
building-related variables including occupant behavior modification and education, efficient buildings systems, building envelope, plug load, maintenance, codes, and green
procurement.
Increasing building efficiency will help the District Government adapt to some of the
likely effects of climate change that are already underway. By operating buildings that
are more efficient to heat and cool, the District Government can realize year round energy savings, as well as savings in energy use during peak periods of use caused by
intense or prolonged hot or cold waves. Managing peak demand can help utility
providers avoid disruption in service if the utility grid becomes strained under these
conditions.

green building.

The eight building measures listed in this section are projected to result in savings of
86,000 metric tons of CO2e in 2012, 204,000 in 2020, and 462,000 in 2050. Projections
are based on the impacts of proposed federal energy legislation and the continued
ramp-up of renewable energy purchases. xv
6.1.1.1 DCPS Facilities Modernization Program
District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) operates the largest number of buildings
(approximately 125) among District agencies, and has the highest emissions from the
buildings sector (123,000 metric tons of CO2e in 2006). The facilities modernization
program being undertaken by the Office of Public Education Facilities Modernization
(OPEFM) will comprehensively update all schools to achieve, at a minimum, the US
Green Building Council Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) for
Schools – Silver designation within 5 to 8 years. LEED Silver complies with the District’s
Green Building Act, but some schools will exceed this standard by achieving LEED
Gold or Platinum status. The school modernization program is being phased so that
high schools will receive full modernization first, with updates ranging from new construction to major renovations (replacement of all major mechanical, electrical, and
plumbing systems; window and roof restoration or replacements; and introduction of
efficient technologies (such as smart boards, computers, cable and wireless internet
access). Updates to elementary and middle schools will be similar in scope, but will be
phased in by first focusing on upgrades to classroom conditions (air quality, lighting,
acoustics, technology, and ergonomics/furnishings), followed later by major system
upgrades.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
The emission reductions associated with this measure are based on expected efficiency gains due to the LEED Silver or greater rating of the modernized facilities. A
25% reduction in total DCPS building energy use was phased in over a 7-year period,
assuming a consistent number of modernizations will be completed annually.

6.1.1.2 50 Percent Renewable Electricity Contract
The Municipal Aggregation Program (MAP) is a reverse auction that allows District
agencies and DC Water to buy electricity jointly. The current MAP is a two year contract that expires at the end of calendar year 2011. For a very small cost premium, the
current power contract boosts purchase of renewable electricity from the previous rate
of 10% to 50%. The rate of renewable energy uptake beyond 2011 is not known.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
The MAP was modeled at four different levels of renewable purchases – 5%, 10%,
25%, and 50%. Emissions savings were arrived at by altering the eGRID emissions
factor for the RFC East sub-region to increase the renewable energy proportion of the
electricity grid mix to a rate corresponding to the percentage purchased under the
MAP. For calculation purposes, it was assumed that the renewable capacity being purchased under the MAP was being generated within the RFC East eGRID sub-region.
6.1.1.3 Public Housing Retrofits
As the District’s largest landlord, the District of Columbia Housing Authority (DCHA) has
undertaken an aggressive campaign to improve the energy efficiency of its 8,000 residential units. To date, the program, begun in 2004, has resulted in the retrofitting of approximately 5,400 units in 31 properties.
Retrofits have included updated energy efficient boilers and chillers, low flow showerheads and faucets, replacement or restored windows, low VOC paint, energy star appliances, and high efficiency lighting. Additionally, one green roof with rain cisterns
and photovoltaic water heat has been installed (at Regency House in Northwest). The
projected energy savings from these improvements include a 13% reduction in electricity usage, a 30% reduction in water usage, and a 26% reduction in gas usage, resulting in as much as $3.9 million in annual average utility savings. Projected operations
and maintenance savings from these improvements are projected to be $2.4 million.”
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
The emission reductions associated with this measure are based on measured efficiency gains of the modernized facilities, and projects that all 8,000 units will be modernized to the same standards by 2020.

6.1.1.4 Building Management Systems & Commissioning
This measure capitalizes on American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) funding that the District Government has
received. Under ARRA, the District will receive more than $30
million in energy efficiency and conservation funding including
$22,022,000 through the State Energy Program (SEP), and
$9,593,500 through the Energy Efficiency and Conservation
Block Grant program (EECBG). Of the combined funds,
$23,729,690 will go to District Government agencies with
buildings and other infrastructure in their capital portfolios that
are in need of energy efficiency improvements.
The Department of Real Estate Services has contracted to conduct energy audits of all buildings in the District government

portfolio by 2012. During the second phase of this measure upgrades and retrofits of
building systems will be designed and installed.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
This measure was modeled by compiling energy consumption for all District Government buildings (excluding DCHA and DC Water) and reducing consumption by 10%
against the 2006 baseline in 2012 to reflect the impact of the SEP/EECBG funding.
For 2020, the energy consumption was reduced by 25% against the 2006 baseline to
reflect capital expenditures that could result from the findings of these comprehensive
audits.
6.1.1.5 Staff Training & Education to Reduce Plug Load
District Government employees have a direct impact on the amount of energy being
used in the office environment, as employees can control the lights, computers and
other electronic equipment at their work stations. More than a third of the District Government's energy use comes from electronic equipment plugged into wall sockets, including devices such as fans and personal heaters that use significantly more energy
than efficient desktop computers and desk lamps. This measure builds on training programs managed by the Department of Real Estate Services (DRES) that are already underway to encourages occupant behavior modifications that encourage employees,
teachers and students to reduce their energy consumption in District facilities. The
focus of the DRES Energy Conservation Campaign is to reduce the number of personal items being used in workspaces.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
This measure was modeled based on a 50% reduction in plug load from personal devices in DRES facilities by 2020, or a 5% reduction annually. Personal devices were assumed to represent 5% of overall plug load.
6.1.1.6 Leased Space Efficiency Improvements
The Department of Real Estate Services (DRES) leases approximately four million
square feet of office space to house District Government personnel. The average length
of a lease is ten years, so when leases expire there are opportunities to relocate staff
into more efficient office space. In 2010 and beyond, there will be significant turnover
in District government office space, providing opportunities to improve efficiency
through the leasing of more energy efficient buildings.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
DRES will be moving District Government staff into more than 518,000 square feet of
LEED office space in 2010, which is roughly 13% of total leased square footage. It is
assumed that this space will be 25% more efficient than the space it is replacing. The
total amount of LEED leased space is modeled to increase to 50% in 2020 and 100%
in 2050, yielding additional savings as new leases replace leases in less energy-efficient
properties.
6.1.1.7 Server Consolidation
Currently the District Government maintains information technology (IT) data servers
in five locations throughout the city. An initiative currently underway will consolidate
these servers into two data centers, using new, highly efficient servers that will use
26

Gaye Park, NE

approximately 30% less energy. District Government staff will also have tighter control
over the servers, resulting in better energy management as servers can be cycled off
when not being utilized and cooling systems can be configured more efficiently.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
The quantification for this measure considers only the savings that will occur as a result of installing more energy efficient IT servers. While other energy savings are anticipated with the consolidation, it is not possible to estimate these using available data.
These estimated savings are considered conservative, since only a portion of the potential energy savings are included. The estimated energy savings are based upon calculating the existing server count and the expected consumption of each standard
server, and applying a 30% reduction to that figure to compute the energy savings.
6.1.1.8 Computer Workstation Efficiency Projects
Since 2007, new computers purchased by the District Government are required to be
ENERGY STAR rated as part of the District’s Environmentally Preferable Purchasing Policy. When in use, these computers save substantial amounts of energy compared to standard units. In addition, the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) has initiated the
LanDesk program, providing the capability to remotely enable any participating District
agency computer’s “sleep” settings, or to power down the machine completely during periods of disuse. The combined effect of these two measures will be to substantially reduce
the energy used for District government computing during working hours, and to eliminate as much energy use as possible from computers that are not in operation.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
Quantification of this measure takes into account the efficiency of the various types of
machines (from desktop to laptop models) and the amount of time they typically spend
Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

27

in use. The calculation for determining the total reductions from ENERGY STAR computers calculates the difference in the average wattage ENERGY STAR computers
draw in active mode (compared to a standard computer) and multiplies that amount by
the number of computers and the annual working hours per machine.
For the LanDesk program, reductions are based on totaling the number of computers
in the program and calculating the difference in power consumption from “active” to
“sleep” mode (during the period between 5:00am and 9:00pm), and the difference in
power consumption from “sleep” mode to “off” (between 9:00pm and 5:00am) for each
workday and 24 hours for all non-workdays in a year. This calculation assumes that the
number of users who had previously enabled the sleep settings on their computers
was 36% of the total, consistent with EPA assumptions. It also assumes that the program only affects desktop computers at each agency, since this is likely the majority
of participating computers and exact figures are not known. This model recognizes
the fact that as the District Government purchases more efficient computers, the marginal benefit of this program will lessen, even though it still contributes to substantial
savings. Emissions benefits are calculated by applying the emissions factor for grid
electricity in the District to the amount of electricity saved.

6.1.2 Transportation
During the 2006 calendar year, emissions from the District Government vehicle fleet
and mobile equipment were 48,000 metric tons of CO2e (7% of the total for all government operations). Emissions from the Employee Commute sector (personal vehicles
used by District Government staff to commute to and from work) were estimated at
33,000 metric tons of CO2e (5% of government emissions).
Strategies to reduce emissions from District Government vehicles can include reducing the size of the fleet, increasing fuel
efficiency, and reducing miles traveled. The District Government is currently undertaking initiatives that pursue each of
these strategies, and has made significant progress in reducing emissions from the vehicles sector. The widespread availability of transit in the District makes that mode an attractive
alternative for employee commuting. Vehicle trips for District
government business average approximately 12 miles per trip,
which makes electrification of the District Government’s lightduty fleet an attractive option once that technology matures
and becomes more cost-effective.
The five measures listed in the transportation section of this
plan are projected to result in savings of 29,000 metric tons of
CO2e in 2012, 36,000 in 2020, and 44,000 in 2050. Projections
are based on the impacts of tightened CAFE standards (and the continued ramp-up of
renewable fuels purchases). The savings enumerated above include measures that will
impact both the vehicles and employee commute.

6.1.2.1 District Government Employee Commute Benefit
District of Columbia Human Resources (DCHR) provides transit incentives, flexible
work schedules, virtual meetings/work-from-home options, carpool/vanpools, enhanced bicycle access and parking and other
measures to provide attractive alternatives to
single-car-occupant driving and parking. District
agencies will continue to choose locations that
are near mass transit to encourage more commuting by bus, rail and streetcar, and will include
Capital Bikeshare stations near their leased and
owned properties to encourage employee participation in the bike sharing network for us for
short trips. Financial incentives may include reduced or free transit passes, reduced or free
parking for carpools, vanpools, and electric or
hybrid vehicles.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
Emissions reductions for this measure calculate
the amount of commuting vehicle miles traveled
per year by District employees, using data from
the District Government Employee Commute
Survey, and projecting mode shifting by those individuals in the amounts of 20% by 2012, 40%
by 2020, and 62% by 2050, eventually matching the current participation rate among
union employees to which the program is currently available.

Generation Pilot, NE

6.1.2.2 Employee Car Sharing Program
The District Government now utilizes a Fleetshare vehicle sharing program for District
business travel, but can also facilitate private car sharing by District employees with
access to street and public space parking and maintenance. The District can increase
car sharing through collaboration with car sharing organizations like Zipcar to make car
sharing more visible, convenient, and available. Identification of the most appropriate
locations for the cars based on demand and proximity to public transportation hubs will
help to grow the program. The District can further help by contributing start-up funds,
assisting in promotion, and by providing increased free parking spaces.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
For this calculation, reductions in total vehicle miles traveled (VMT) are estimated by
increasing the number of District employee carshare participants to 3,600 by year
2050, multiplied by average commute length and the average percent reduction in driving that carshare participants achieve when they give up owning a car. Emissions savings in each analysis year are driven by both the reduction in VMT and the average fuel
economy of the cars in that year, totaling 658 metric tons CO2e in 2012. Projections to
2020 and 2050 reflect higher anticipated fuel economy in those years which creates a
smaller reduction per person. However with the number of anticipated additional participants in those years the total emissions reduction figures continue to grow to 861
and 1,962 metric tons CO2e in 2020 and 2050 respectively.

6.1.2.3 Electric Vehicle Usage
The District Government will pilot and expand use of electric vehicles and development
of electric charging infrastructure. The District Department of Transportation and other
agencies will begin pilots when electric vehicles are commercially available. DC Water
plans to replace 79 utility vehicles used on the Blue Plains campus with neighborhood
electric vehicles (NEVs). To date, 10 utility vehicles have been converted, 20 are budgeted for conversion in 2010, and 20 more in 2011, bringing the total conversion to
about 65% of the utility vehicles by 2012. For this calculation it is projected that there
will have been 200 replacements by 2020 and 350 replacements by 2050 throughout
the rest of the District Government Fleet.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
Calculations for this measure include first determining the amount of gasoline related
emissions that would be saved by replacing gasoline powered vehicles with electric
ones. For this estimation, the 2012 calculation is based on the average annual mileage
of District fleet vehicles and their current average fuel economy. The reduction in gasoline emissions is tempered by increased emissions associated with using electricity
as a substitute fuel. This is calculated using the same number of miles traveled and an
gasoline equivalent miles per gallon of an electric vehicle in terms of kWh per mile.
The total reduction in 2012 is estimated at 61 metric tons of CO2e. In projecting to
2020 and 2050, changes in the base fuel economy of the vehicles replaced as well as
the carbon intensity of grid electricity must be included. The best reference for both of
these changes comes from the VISION model from Argonne National Labs. In 2020, the
base vehicle fuel economy increases to 28.22 mpg, while there is no significant change
reported in the carbon intensity of the grid. The result is that the incremental benefit of
each vehicle replacement is less and thus the total reduction (69 metric tons of CO2e)
is only slightly more with now 200 electric vehicles than it was for the 79 initial vehicles. In 2050 the VISION model projects an average on road mpg of 34.98. Under the
“renewables” scenario, which is in line with other projections in this report, the carbon
content of grid electricity has decreased by 61%. With cleaner grid electricity, the
downside of increasing electricity use is much less, which explains the much more
significant impact of 193 metric tons of CO2e from the action in 2050.
6.1.2.4 Metropolitan Police Department Cruiser Fleet Right-Sizing
The Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) operates the largest fleet in the District
government, both in terms of absolute number of vehicles (1,686 in 2006) and gallons
of fuel consumed (1,714,000 gallons of gasoline). This measure addresses marked and
unmarked cruisers (1,184 in 2006) in the patrol fleet that use the majority of the fuel
(1,350,000 gallons of gasoline). The “right-sizing” of this fleet consists of replacing V8powered Ford Crown Victoria cruisers with more fuel efficient V6-powered Chevrolet
Impalas, and with more fuel efficient models in future years.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
Several assumptions were made in modeling the emissions reductions associated with
this measure. It was assumed that 85% of the MPD cruiser fleet in 2006 was comprised
of Ford Crown Victorias, and that 30% of Crown Victorias would be phased out in 2012,
increasing to 100% by 2020. Additionally, reductions in fuel use were calculated by applying the difference in EPA average fuel efficiency between the two models (Impalas are
26% more efficient) to the projected vehicle mix in a given year.

6.1.3 Street Lighting
During the 2006 calendar year, streetlights and traffic signals accounted for 6% of the
total District Government operations direct emissions (46,000 metric tons of CO2e). A
number of innovative emerging technologies, such as induction, light-emitting diode
(LED) and solar lighting, have the potential to cut street lighting energy use substantially over time. Reductions in street lighting may be comparable to those seen when
the District converted to LED traffic signals in 2005. The lighting conversion process
is projected to result in savings of 1,700 metric tons of CO2e in 2012, 10,800 in 2020,
and 32,000 in 2050. As a result of these conversions, emissions from street lighting are
estimated to decrease by over 70%, but the exact reductions will depend on the mix
of technologies selected by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) at the
conclusion of the current pilot programs being conducted.
6.1.3.1 Street Lighting Retrofits
The District Department of Transportation (DDOT) is responsible for the installation and
repair of all street lighting in the District and is currently engaged in a pilot program to
identify the next-generation lighting technology it will deploy to replace the current mix
of high pressure sodium, incandescent, mercury vapor, and metal halide street lights.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
The model assumes that the replacement lighting technology will be 70% more efficient than the existing technology mix, a conservative figure that gives DDOT flexibility in choosing the best technology for a given application. The model projects 5%
conversion in 2012, 33% conversion in 2020, and 100% conversion in 2050.

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

31

6.1.4 Water and Wastewater
In 2006, wastewater facilities were responsible for 23% of government operations emissions, with a total of 163,000 metric tons of CO2e. Emissions from wastewater treatment
can be reduced by decreasing flow volumes, reducing energy consumption through
process innovation, and finding ways to re-use process by-products.
Upgrades to the water distribution and wastewater treatment systems are projected to
result in savings of 36,700 metric tons of CO2e in 2012, 73,800 in 2020, and 129,500 in
2050. The actions listed in this plan highlight several major initiatives being undertaken
by DC Water, but the authority is beginning a comprehensive, organization-wide assessment of energy use that is likely to identify further opportunities. Even so, the items
listed in this plan will cut emissions from DC Water facilities by nearly 50% by 2020.
6.1.4.1 Blue Plains Fine Bubble Diffuser Retrofit
DC Water has installed highly efficient fine bubble diffusers for use in its aerated wastewater treatment processes at Blue Plains. With finer bubbles, more of the oxygen supplied to the process will dissolve into the water and facilitate the treatment process.
With more effective aeration, less overall pumping of air is needed to achieve the same
treatment effect. This change will conserve an estimated 70 gigawatt hours of electricity per year.

32

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
The energy savings for this measure were computed by DC Water as part of an engineering study for the project. The emission factor for electricity generation is then applied to the energy savings to compute the emissions reduction.
6.1.4.2 Blue Plains Anaerobic Digester Project
DC Water plans to implement an anaerobic digestion system to further treat biosolids
and sludge from the Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Facility. Anaerobic digestion utilizes microbes to breakdown the solids, producing several beneficial by-products while
considerably reducing the volume of solids that must be hauled away and landfilled.
Digested sludge material is safer to handle, and can be marketed as a soil amendment rather than disposed of as a hazardous waste product. In addition, the volume
of sludge material is reduced by approximately 50%, requiring substantially less truck
traffic to transport it. Another by-product of
anaerobic digestion is methane gas which
can then be burned to provide heat for the
facility and to run a turbine to create nonfossil fuel electricity.
Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
Engineering studies of the co-generation
potential proposed by DC Water project
that the methane produced will generate a
minimum of 10 megawatts of electricity.
Emissions reductions are calculated by applying the emissions factor for grid electricity in the District to that amount of
electricity that would not need to be produced by the fossil fuel based electricity
grid.

6.1.5 Solid Waste
Emissions from government-generated
solid waste accounted for an estimated
625 metric tons of CO2e during the 2006
calendar year, just 0.1% of the District government operations total of 720,000 metric
tons of CO2e. For many reasons that go beyond the direct climate emissions reductions goals of this report, the District Government is engaging in a widespread effort
to provide receptacles, educate staff, and improve tracking that will significantly increase recycling participation rates.

6.1.5.1 Recycling in District Government Facilities
Greenhouse gas emissions from solid waste occur when organic material degrades
anaerobically in a landfill resulting in the formation of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
By increasing the recycling rate, less of this material will be entering the landfill and cre-

rate of at 22%. The goal is to increase this rate to 30% by 2012 and 50% by 2020.

Emissions Reduction Modeling Approach:
Due to a lack of data on the subject, it is assumed that the composition of District facility waste is similar to other commercial waste streams. It is also assumed that recycling occurs for each material type in proportion to the generation rate for that material
type. With increasing recycling rates the methane producing portions of the waste
stream are reduced from what was headed for a landfill, avoiding those emissions.

6.2 Community Measures to Reduce Emissions
Section 6.1 provides a detailed proposal for reducing emissions from the operations
of the District Government. However, the District Government’s share of our total emissions from the District of Columbia community is only 6%. It will take an effective and
extensive partnership between government and all sectors of our community to address the 94% of emissions coming from actions not under the direct control of the
District Government. The District Government has a role to play – by setting policies
and establishing programs to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in our
city – but the solution to the challenges of climate change will require everyone’s participation.

6.2.1 Community Engagement
This Draft Climate Action Plan provides a starting point for dialog to identify community-wide measures that, together with the government operations measures described
in this report, will allow the District to meet emissions reduction targets. Over the coming months, the District Government will convene public forums to engage community
members, businesses, institutions, and other stakeholders in the effort to establish
community reduction targets and identify specific measures and commitments needed
to achieve those targets.
The goal of the public engagement process is to identify how each member of our
community, from the individual resident to the largest institutions, can do their part to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The District Government will do its part to encourage emissions reductions across the community by establishing policies and programs
that promote efficient building design, reduce energy consumption, provide transportation alternatives, encourage smart land use patterns, provide waste management
alternatives, and allocation of District Government and federal financial resources
wisely.

6.2.2 Community Target Setting
An emissions reduction target represents the percentage by which a community will reduce total greenhouse gas emissions below its base year levels. What are the realistic options for community targets and mitigation measures? These are the options we
will develop together during the community engagement process. There are, however,
examples and guidelines for us to refer to. Employing the measures discussed in the
report (and others identified during the public planning process), the District as a com-

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

munity should strive to meet or exceed the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments recommended regional goals of reducing emissions by 10% in 2012, 20%
in 2020, and 80% in 2050. xvi
Typically, several reduction targets are selected to correspond with a series of future
target years. Setting targets for the District of Columbia community will first require an
estimation of future emissions totals, which is presented below under “business as
usual” projections. Second, estimates of the impacts of actions that are already underway, combined with the effects of external factors such as the
carbon intensity of the electric utility grid, national fuel economy
standards for automobiles, and technology improvements, are taken
into account. Third, through the community engagement process,
residents, government and private sector experts, businesses and
institutions will explore the potential impacts of actions they can take
to reduce climate emissions Emission reduction goals for the Community will be set based on the overall assessment of these three
factors.
As depicted in Table 4.1 and Figure 4.1, “business as usual” projections anticipate that the District’s community greenhouse gas
emissions will grow by approximately 3.7 million annual tons (or
35%) by the year 2050. Reducing emissions to a point below the
2006 baseline will require additional emissions reductions to counter anticipated increases in emissions over time.

Canal, NW

Table ES.5 summarizes proposed community-wide measures that can reduce the District’s greenhouse gas emissions. Some of the measures listed have already been initiated and are in the process of implementation, such as the DC Green Building Act,
the Clean and Affordable Energy Act, and the updated 2008 Building Code. Others
represent programs now being planned or discussed, such as further greening of the
Building Code, programs for financing energy efficiency retrofits (also known as
“PACE”), and expanded mass transit, bicycle and pedestrian options. Others represent
best practices taken from other private sector or community-wide actions in other jurisdictions that could be considered for application here within the District.

How was the proposed list of Community measures developed?
The list of proposed measures to reduce community emissions was derived
from a review of the actions and commitments in the Green DC Agenda and a
review of best practices from other cities. This list was refined to isolate measures that would provide the most significant emissions reductions. Significant
input and guidance also came from the work of the Metropolitan Washington
Council of Governments (MWCOG), whose Board approved regional climate
guidance in December 2008.

6.2.3 Proposed Measures for Discussion
Buildings
Buildings are responsible for 75% of greenhouse gas emissions in the District and are
therefore the right place to start making reductions. Many factors determine how much
energy a building uses, including building construction, usage,
energy systems and load and occupant behavior. The actions
taken at the community scale will help to address all of these aspects to significantly reduce building energy consumption within
the District.

The District is a national leader in
Green and Cool Roof installation.

As the District works to mitigate climate change by reducing its
emissions, these same measures occasionally have adaptation
benefits for changes in climate that will occur even with preventative measures. For example, creating high performance buildings throughout the District will do a great deal to insulate the
businesses and residents from the financial effects of extreme
weather events such as heat waves. Measures aimed at vulnerable populations will help to reduce the human impact of such
extreme events. By increasing efficiency broadly, utility providers
will be better able to manage peak loads during extreme weather
events and help to avoid service disruption at critical times. With
less spending on energy for businesses and residents in the District, more money will
be available for other purposes, improving the local economic outlook.
Green Building Act (GBA)
The GBA will require that beginning in 2012 non-residential new construction over
50,000 square feet in size meet the LEED Certified standard. This measure will be implemented as new large scale developments occur within the District. The benefit of
this measure is largely dependent on the amount of development that is likely to occur
under these guidelines. Looking towards 2050, the GBA is likely to be revisited and
strengthened in the future.
Clean and Affordable Energy Act of 2008 (CAEA)
Sustainable Energy Utility: the CAEA redirects existing utility assessment fees to a new
Sustainable Energy Trust Fund that will be used to promote and catalyze energy efficiency projects throughout the city. These projects are aimed at efficiency, renewable
generation, peak load management, and the creation of green-collar jobs. Specific target areas include energy intensive enterprises and services for low-income residents.
Renewable Portfolio Standard: the CAEA sets a standard for the amount of renewable
energy that all electricity suppliers to the District must meet. The percentage of renewable energy increases each year up to 20% in 2020.
Greening the Building Code
By revising our building codes to include higher energy and water efficiency standards,
the District will ensure that all new buildings and redevelopment will be more efficient,
including buildings that are smaller than the 50,000 square feet threshold of the Green
Building Act. In 2008, the District became one of the few jurisdictions to adopt the lat-

36

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

est energy and water conservation codes, and the District will revise the codes again
in 2010 and regularly after that.
Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE)
The District will offer long-term loans to property owners, to be repaid on their property tax bills, to finance energy efficiency retrofits of residential, multi-family, and commercial properties citywide.
With recent passage of legislation to authorize a property assessed clean energy
(“PACE”) program and authorize issuance of $250 million of non-recourse bonds, the
District is poised to lead the nation in implementing a major retrofit finance program
that will save properties owners millions of dollars on energy, improve the comfort,
condition and marketability of properties across our city, and create green jobs and
business opportunities for District residents.
Office and Residential Energy Efficiency Retrofits and Weatherization
The District Department of the Environment offers programs that promote energy savings in homes through retrofits and weatherization. The energy and climate emissions
savings that will result from these programs will be dependent upon the number and
type of retrofit actions that will occur under the program. This information, combined
with published reports on how these measures have performed under similar programs, will be used to compute the total energy savings.
Energy Efficiency Improvements for Federal Buildings in the District
Federal Executive Orders require all federal agencies to reach a minimum 30% reduction in energy intensity (a measure of energy use) by 2015, while significantly increasing the amount of energy derived from renewable sources. A target of 16% reduction
in water consumption is also required. These orders apply to all federal buildings in the
District, and represent a significant component of our overall community emissions.
Green Building and Energy Challenges to Key Sectors
Competition motivates people to change their ways. There are a number of examples
of climate reduction challenges among business sectors, universities and other institutions, and neighborhoods that have delivered significant reductions in energy use.
The District Government will help facilitate these sector challenges building on the
leadership of sector leaders citywide.
“District” Heating and Energy Systems
The District already has a several “district,” or centralized, heating and energy systems in place (for example, the federal General Services Administration, Soldiers and
Airmen’s Home, U.S. Capitol complex, White House/Old Executive Office Building ,
and several universities). District heating or energy systems use a central plant to produce heat, chilled water, or energy for distribution across many buildings. Increasing
the efficiency of these large heating and cooling systems could save energy. In other
communities, particularly in Europe, cities are promoting expansion of these district
systems to provide efficient heating and cooling to other buildings nearby.
Solar Co-ops and Other Micro-utilities
Use of renewable electric systems, high efficiency heating or other efficient practices
can be promoted through co-ops at the neighborhood-level. Rooftops, parking lots,
yards, parks, rights of way, streets, and other public and private space can be utilized

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

37

in very creative means to create decentralized power sources across the District. Coordinated design, community organization, and implementation models are key to success on a site/neighborhood basis. A strong foundation for this work exists in the
citizen-organized solar co-ops already in place. These efforts could be enhanced and
facilitated by an effective and replicable financing plan and streamlined administrative
processing.
Power Purchase Agreements
A Power Purchase Agreement, or PPA, is a long-term contract to buy power from a
specific energy provider. Solar PPAs are agreements between a home or business
property owner and a buyer who will purchase solar power generated at the property
at a long-term rate, often equal to or less than market rates. Under a PPA, a solar electric facility is installed on a customer’s roof without the customer needing to purchase
any hardware—making going solar as easy as paying a regular power bill. District government can take a leading role in easing the adoption of PPAs within the commercial
and residential sectors.
Purchase of Renewable Power
Consumers in the District already have the choice to purchase up to 100% renewablesource electric power through several vendors. Education and cooperative purchasing can promote expanded renewable purchasing by residents, businesses and
institutions. Information is available at www.greenenergy.dc.gov.
Green and Reflective “Cool” Roofing
Use of green and reflective “cool” roofs can greatly reduce the energy needed to cool
buildings and make buildings more comfortable for occupants at a relatively low cost.
Cool roofs can also help combat the urban “heat island effect,” which keeps the inner
city hotter than surrounding areas due to heat retention of pavement and roofing ma-

38

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

terials. The District Building Code now incorporates cool roof requirements, but education and incentives can help to speed adoption of these technologies.
Industrial Scale Renewable Co-Generation
Several small generation plants in the District are scheduled to go off-line in the next
several years. Exploring opportunities to open cleaner burning facilities using natural
gas or a combination of renewable sources could provide opportunities for expansion
of high efficiency, locally-generated power to provide cleaner, more reliable power for
the District.
Federal Light Bulb Efficiency Standards
Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, all light bulbs must use
25% to 30% less energy than today's products by 2012 to 2014. The phase-in will
start with 100-watt bulbs in January 2012 and end with 40-watt bulbs in January 2014.
By 2020, bulbs must be 70% more efficient. Compact fluorescent bulbs already meet
the 70% efficiency standard. The average U.S. household has more than 40 sockets
for light bulbs, ranging from table lamps to ceiling fixtures. Larger homes can have
even more. In Washington, DC, our 285,000 homes could have as many as 11,400,000
light bulbs. Lighting accounts for about 20% of annual household electricity bills, or
over $200 per year in the average household. Replacing incandescent bulbs with ENERGY STAR qualified light bulbs provides significant benefits for consumers.
Transportation
Transportation emissions represent the second largest emissions class in the District,
accounting for nearly one quarter of all emissions. The District’s transportation emissions come from a wide array of sources, including vehicles driven by District residents, hundreds of thousands of daily commuters from outside of the city, and visiting
tourists and business travelers. By expanding opportunities for both residents and
commuters to take public transit and encouraging fuel efficient vehicles, the District
can both reduce vehicle emissions and create a healthier environment.
Bus Rapid Transit Expansion
Through a number of individual projects and initiatives, the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority (WMATA) and the District Department of Transportation will
expand Bus Rapid Transit routes such as express buses and the Circulator system
throughout the city and provide a higher level of transit service to an increased number of residents. Parts of this system are already in place. By 2030, an additional
118,000 weekday riders are expected to use public transit.
Streetcar Project
The Anacostia Streetcar Project represents the first step in the District’s commitment
to redevelop streetcar lines along some of the city’s highly-traveled corridors. Streetcar lines will bring a high level of service transit system to areas of the District previously poorly connected to the rest of the Metro and other parts of the transit system.
The first segment of the Anacostia streetcar line is expected to begin revenue service
by late 2012, with the H Street/Benning Road streetcar line starting shortly thereafter.
The remainder of the system plan will be implemented as funding becomes available.
Capital Bikeshare Program Expansion
The District is among the first cities in North America to launch a publicly available, self-

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

39

serve bike sharing program. The Introduction and expansion of bike sharing increases
the number of alternative transportation modes available to District residents and allows for people to be able to take transit to the city core while having the mobility to
run short errands throughout the day. Currently the program is expanding from 100 to
more than 1,000 bikes and from 10 stations to more than 100 in the District and Northern Virginia. According to a survey of bike share program users, approximately 16% of
the trips taken on a smart bike were replacing a car trip.
Bicycle Master Plan Implementation
The District Bicycle Master Plan has been in place for more than 10 years and has
made significant improvements in cycling conditions. With better routes, facilities and
more options for parking bikes in safe and convenient locations, more District residents are expected to take advantage of the low cost and health benefits of bicycle
commuting. The District Government has already begun implementation of the master plan. In 2009 the number of miles of bike lanes in the District rose to 39.5 miles and
there are at least 1,000 public racks available. In 2009, the Union Station Bike Station
opened, providing premium parking, retail and repair services, and bike rentals.
Performance Based Parking
In order to move more trips to transit and active transportation, the District Department of Transportation will continue to implement “performance based parking” with
increased rates during high demand periods and areas to
support further adoption of other modes of travel and reduce congestion.
Incentives for Hybrid Vehicles
Increasing the rate of hybrid vehicle adoption will reduce
emissions by improving the collective fuel economy of
the vehicles in the District. The District Government already has incentives in place to encourage hybrid vehicle purchases including the elimination of sales tax on
hybrids and a 50% discount in registration fees.

the Anacostia River, NE

Electric Vehicle Plug-In Stations
Expansion of public and private infrastructure to support
electric vehicle charging in various stations around the
city will facilitate the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles.
As residents and companies shift to electric vehicles, reductions in gasoline consumption will result in lower emissions from the passenger car sector. Net emissions
reductions from this measure can be calculated by estimating the increased amount
of grid electricity that will be consumed and subtracting the resultant emissions from
the reduction in gasoline consumption.
Fuel Efficient Tour Buses and Anti-Idling
Working with the wide variety of tour bus operators from within and outside of the city,
the District can provide incentives for fuel efficient and clean running tour buses to reduce the impact of tourism related emissions in the District.
Promotion of Car Sharing Programs
The District already has one of the highest rates of car share participation in the country and opportunity for expansion. The District Department of Transportation facilitates

40

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

usage by providing car share parking spaces at key locations across the city. Public education and promotion by
government and business will help drive demand and increase usage.
Federal CAFE Standards
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have proposed an increase in the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for all passenger and light truck models for 2012 to
2016. Current CAFE standards are set at 27.5 MPG. The new
CAFE standards require an estimated combined average
miles per gallon (MPG) of 34.1 by 2016. Improving fuel economy will reduce the District's greenhouse gas emissions as vehicles use less fuel. As
vehicles are regularly replaced on a variable timeframe, it is estimated that the full effects
of implementing a federal CAFE standard will not be experienced for 8 to 10 years.

Preserving green space
benefits residents and the
environment

Land Use
The way that the District has developed over time has shaped where residents live,
work and play in the city. Smart growth policies, such as mixed-use development, can
bring these destinations closer together, and provide more transportation choices for
residents, like walking, biking or transit. Land use practices that favor walkable communities and development near transit can reduce vehicle miles traveled, which helps
mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while also improving air quality and health outcomes.
Efficient land use practices in the city and measures that increase vegetation can increase the environmental performance of the urban environment. Green space and
urban trees provide cooling benefits that reduce energy costs and render the city more
resilient to the urban heat island effect and heat waves.
Land Use Patterns That Increase Transportation Choices
The District of Columbia’s Comprehensive Plan supports compact, transit oriented
development. Efficient land use policies bring residents closer to their destinations and
transit opportunities, therefore increasing opportunities for walking, biking, and public
transit trips to replace motor vehicle trips.
Small Area Plans
The District of Columbia is in the process of implementing 20 Small Area Plans (SAPs)
city-wide. These plans, along with other planning documents like the Comprehensive
Plan, guide development in more climate friendly patterns. Increasing the number and
diversity of end-uses in a small area with compact and mixed-use buildings increases
opportunities for district heating systems and co-generation.
Increased Tree Canopy in the District
Mature trees serve to shade buildings and act as wind breaks, reducing energy use in
the District. Trees also reduce the amount of stormwater runoff that is generated during large rain events, and by reducing the water treatment load on the Blue Plains
wastewater treatment facility thereby reducing energy use at the facility. The District’s
goal is to increase its urban tree canopy to 40% by 2036.

41

Green and Sustainable Land Use Patterns and Development Practices
To promote green development, the District of Columbia actively supports the use of
green building methods, like green roofs, in new construction and rehabilitation projects. Green roofs not only insulate buildings and subsequently reduce energy usage
for heating and cooling, but they also absorb and reduce the flow of storm water into
the sewer system. Additionally, public realm designs in the District favor tree boxes,
planting areas on public sidewalks, and reduction in impervious surfaces.
Sustainable Zoning
The comprehensive update process for the District of Columbia’s zoning code included
an in-depth examination of elements of sustainability. In order to enable and encourage sustainability through the regulations guiding the built environment of the District,
the Office of Planning has recommended changes to the zoning code. Major topics
covered include climate change; energy conservation and renewable energy production; integrating land use and mobility; water conservation and greywater; slopes,
streams, stormwater and hydrology; food production/security and community health;
and sustainable business and ‘green’ jobs.
Waste and Recycling
Municipal solid waste results in greenhouse gas emissions when organic material degrades in a landfill. These waste measures divert material entering the landfill and thus
prevent emissions that would have been released from the degradation process.
Increase Commercial Recycling
The majority of the District’s waste comes from the commercial sector. The Department
of Public Works will expand programs to work with both property managers and tenants to improve commercial recycling rates to 45% diversion. Reductions calculations
in this case will be based upon the amount of organic material that would be diverted
from the landfill by increasing overall diversion rates to 45%. Emissions reductions are
based upon the amount of methane materials would have generated in the landfill had
they not been diverted.
Increase Residential Recycling
Current residential recycling rates are at 24%. The District plans to increase this percentage to 45% by 2050 through outreach and other programs (such as expanding
material collected and incentives for recycling).
Waste to Energy
Beginning in 2007, a portion of the District’s municipal waste has been incinerated in
a waste-to-energy plant rather than landfilled. Burning municipal solid waste (MSW)
produces energy and emissions, which offset alternative emissions from utility electricity production.
Organic Waste Composting
Organic matter such as yard waste is the key component of solid waste that leads to
the formation of methane in landfills. By increasing the amount of leaf matter that is collected for composting rather than being landfilled, these emissions are avoided. The
District plans to increase the diversion of leaves and Christmas trees from current levels of 54% to 100% by 2050.

Cross-Cutting Efforts
Climate Benefit Program
Other cities around the nation have established voluntary programs to allow businesses, institutions or individuals to “purchase” additional greenhouse gas
emissions through private donations to support projects
that reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the District’s boundaries. Donations could be official carbon offsets or unofficial carbon benefits and are run in some
cases by governments or in others by private non-profit
entities. Local actions that could be funded could include
weatherization of low income properties, installation of
solar energy systems, composting, large scale tree planting projects and more.
Green Purchasing
District Government, local businesses and associations, and residents can reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions by choosing to purchase and use less carbon-intensive
products. The use of these products reduces environmental impacts associated with
the manufacture, use and disposal of many items in common daily use. The District
Government is adopting Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) practices for
District Government agencies. A number of government and private sector EPP program models are available to guide businesses and individuals on EPP, such as the EPA
Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPG) for recycled content, and Energy Star
and EPEAT Silver ranked computers. Examples of target products include: office supplies; computers and peripherals; copiers; vending machines; lighting; carpet; and
cleaning supplies and chemicals.

7 Other Benefits of Climate Protection
Many of the actions taken to mitigate climate change also contribute other community
goals, like strengthening the local economy, reducing other types of urban pollution,
improved health, and increased quality of life.
As we improve building efficiency and quality with buildings that are more energy efficient, costs will decrease with lower energy and water bills, freeing up money for investment. In 2006, the District Government spent over
$100 million on energy to power buildings and operate its
vehicle fleet. Many of the measures in this plan have
short-term payback periods, and save on both direct and
indirect costs. For instance, a “right-sized” vehicle fleet
is less expensive to purchase and fuel, while also being
less costly to maintain.
A key side-benefit of climate change mitigation activities
is enhanced energy security and reliability of locally generated power, an issue that is especially relevant to the
District given the critical government business that is
conducted here.

Green building standards and codes that enhance energy efficiency and reduce costs also improve indoor air
quality, which can reduce occupants’ exposure to harmful chemicals and other irritants. Improved air quality, along with increased natural light,
has been shown to improve productivity among workers and students which will in
turn yield positive economic benefits.
As Washington, DC, invests in safe and convenient forms of alternative transportation,
and becomes less dependent on the automobile, the flow of local dollars out of the District to pay for fuel (often from foreign suppliers) will decrease. Automobiles are a significant source of local air pollution including ozone, particulate matter, and carbon
monoxide, which have negative health effects and can lead to asthma and other
breathing disorders. Less automobile dependence is correlated with an increased number of people choosing active lifestyles that include regular walking and cycling to
reach their destinations. Investments in alternative transportation that reduce emissions from commuters will also yield increased mobility benefits in the form of better
levels of service in transit systems and better viability for modes like walking and biking to reach needed destinations for the 36% of District residents who do not own
cars. xvii
Restoring our tree canopy and increasing the amount of green vegetated space will not
only shade buildings, cool streets and reduce energy usage, but will also reduce
stormwater runoff, combined sewer overflows and other non-point source water pollution, leading to healthier waterways including the Anacostia and Potomac Rivers,
Rock Creek and the Chesapeake Bay. Urban trees and green space also create more
welcoming and memorable locations and have been linked to increases in spending
in retail locations and overall increased property values. xix
The effect of these additional benefits is magnified when viewed through the lens of climate adaptation—the steps we can take to prepare for the effects of a changing climate. In light of the considerable past and ongoing emissions of greenhouse gas here
in the District and worldwide, we have already set the planet on a course for some de-

44

Climate of Opportunity: A Climate Action Plan for the District of Columbia
Draft for Community Discussion

gree of climate change. Extreme weather events, volatility in energy prices and reliability, heat driven poor air quality days, and flooding of low-lying areas are all likely to
increase with climate change. Many of the actions identified here to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions will also help the District’s government, businesses and residents to adapt to a changing climate. For example, extreme and prolonged heat waves
can put considerable strain on the reliability of energy delivery in peak periods; possibly leading to service disruption during times when cooling is most needed. By increasing efficiency across the city, such service disruptions are less likely and the city
will be able to better cope with those situations. Additional measures aimed solely at
climate adaptation, such as modifying flood protection and heat emergency response
programs will also be addressed in this Draft Climate Action Plan.
While some of the actions to fight climate change may involve additional upfront costs,
such expenses are very often outweighed by long-term savings in energy use or provide other significant community benefits to improve quality of life for District residents.
For example, the State of California has cut the energy use required to cool new homes
by approximately two thirds since the 1970s through building codes, despite ever increasing home size. Total energy savings achieved are valued at over $30 billion. xx

8 Next Steps
The government operations and community measures described in this plan could establish the District as a national leader in areas of renewable energy, alternative fuels,
and energy efficient wastewater treatment practices.
Following the public comment period, the District will finalize the Climate Action Plan
with final targets and measures. For the final set of Government Operations measures,
the District Government will refine emissions reductions estimates and, wherever possible, estimate the cost of the measures and related costs savings and projected payback periods.
To develop a final set of community emissions reduction targets and specific mitigation and adaptation measures, the District Government will engage with community
members, businesses, institutions, and other stakeholders through public forums and
meetings, and by gathering comments from the community.

Reduction targets are relative to the forecasted medium-growth scenarios,
under which greenhouse gas emissions from Government Operations are anticipated to rise to 887,659 metric tons of CO2e or 27% by 2050.

ii

The District’s emissions have been projected out to 2050 under three scenarios:
low, medium, and high growth. Based on expected growth in the District’s population and employment, it is expected that greenhouse gas emission will increase 14% in the District by 2020 and 35% by 2050. Under the medium
growth scenario, emissions are forecasted to rise to 14,284,067 metric tons of
CO2e, an increase of approximately 35% by 2050. These scenarios presume
greenhouse gas emission levels if the District takes no action to reduce emissions.

This number represents a “roll-up” of emissions, and is not intended to represent a complete picture of emissions from the District’s operations. This roll-up
number should not be used for comparison with other local government roll-up
numbers without a detailed analysis of the basis for this total.

xiii For buildings, the forecast uses the Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimate of 1.1% annual increase in commercial building energy consumption.
The building forecast contains an additional correction to account for the anticipated increase in energy use in modernized school facilities. Vehicles and employee commute emissions are projected to grow at 0.4% annually, according
to the EIA. DCWASA does not expect its service population to increase, but the
forecast does account for the energy consumption of known expansions of
DCWASA operations. Emissions from traffic signals and street lighting are not
expected to increase, while emissions from solid waste are forecast to increase
with increases in employment.

Savings exceed 100% of the 2006 totals because buildings emissions are projected to grow significantly under a “business as usual scenario”, and also due
to the renewable energy purchases listed in this section applying to other sectors.

Draft for Community Discussion

We Want Your Comments and Input
This document is a Draft for Community Discussion. You can contribute to the
District’s climate planning effort by providing input in two ways:
First, the District Department of the Environment (DDOE) is asking for public
comments on the list of proposed Government Operations Actions (Section
6.1) by November 15, 2010. You can submit comments via e-mail to
climate.plan@dc.gov or by mail to DDOE, Climate Action Comments, 1200
First St NE, 5th Floor, Washington, DC 20002.
Second, you can participate in a series of public forums and meetings convened by DDOE to gather input and comments on the proposed Government
Operations Plan (Section 6.1) and the Community Discussion Draft (Section
6.2). More information on the climate engagement process can be found at
www.green.dc.gov, by e-mailing climate.plan@dc.gov, or calling 202-535-2600.

What You Can Do …
… to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions (and Save Money)!
Every kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity we avoid using prevents more than 1½
pounds of carbon dioxide from being pumped into the atmosphere – and saves
money. Here are some quick tips to help you use your money wisely.
At Home and at Work

☑ Conduct an energy audit to identify possible energy and water efficiency im☑

provements. Look for free energy audit services offered by the District Department of the Environment!
Purchase green power generated from wind, solar and hydroelectric. This
option is available to all District customers – see www.greenenergy.dc.gov
for more information on “Clean Energy Providers in the District.”
Weatherize and insulate your space to reduce heating and cooling costs and
make your home and workspace more comfortable.
Adjust your thermostat to keep your home or workspace cooler in the winter
(68° or lower) and warmer in the summer (78° or higher). A programmable
thermostat or building management system helps to automatically regulate
temperatures.
Purchase only ENERGY STAR appliances and electronics; unplug electronics
including televisions, video and stereo equipment, kitchen appliances and
chargers when not in use (a smart powerstrip can make this easy).
Change incandescent light bulbs to compact fluorescent or LED bulbs; install
motion sensors and timers on switches.
Lower the temperature on your water heater to 120° and turn it off when leaving for extended periods of time. Electric water heaters can be set on timers;
gas heaters must be set manually.
Set refrigerator temperatures between 37° and 40° and clean the coils regularly. Keep the refrigerator stocked; it takes more energy to cool an empty refrigerator.

☑ Walk, bike or use public transportation to enjoy our beautiful city and be
healthy. Whenever possible, leave the car at home.
☑ Participate in the Metro SmartBenefits and MWCOG Commuter Connections
programs to reduce vehicle use.
☑ Reduce your number of vehicles or vehicle fleet, and convert to alternative
fuel vehicles.
☑ Save water by washing only full loads of dishes and clothes (in cold water),
taking shorter showers, installing low-flow fixtures and capturing rain in rain
barrels to water lawns and gardens.
